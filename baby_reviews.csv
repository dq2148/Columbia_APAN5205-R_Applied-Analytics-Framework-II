1,"Has columns for all the info I need at a glance when I get home from work. Nanny is able to fill it out easily....love it",5
2,"GREAT journal. We use this everyday to communicate feeding, medicine and other needs when I don't have time to give my nanny the full rundown. LOVE it! I've bought two!",5
3,"Great way to keep track of important daily activities/tasks when you are trying to get used to your new baby's routine.I include this as a gift to all of my friends now when they are having a baby.",5
4,"My son loves to chew on things and is still awaiting his first tooth. His older brother had the strawberry vibrating teether but I prefer this one because it doesn't look so feminine and it is also less expensive.",4
5,"This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",1
6,"Initially, my baby was not able to cause it to vibrate on his own because he just wasn't chomping down hard enough. But now, he can do it. Now, he's able to see the cause and effect of using this. I like that. Plus, I think it feels good on his gums.",5
7,"My baby hated this thing so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness. Bit it seemed like a cool idea. Passed it on.",3
8,"Started potty training and this has been our best purchase. Rarely my crazy sleeper will roll to a part of the bed thats not covered and pee but usually this pad protects the sheets and saves me from having to change all the sheets. Stays put. Washes well",5
9,"What a waste of money and more importantly my time!This thing does not work well at al!! I can't fit a larger cable through it.  PLUS if you have plugs that go sideways like our ROKU does. You can't use it. So i had to buy a power strip but the power strip is too thick and won't work. So this ended up in the garbage.",1
10,"If you want to keep the plug in there forever, it is the best one. But the first time, you still need to open it to install. After you put it on the wall, it's really hard to remove. Another con is the cover is too small, that I cannot put anything other than a stand lamp in it.",1
11,"This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.",5
12,"I believe that this product would prevent a child from tampering with a power strip, but the plastic is quite thin and I was worried as I used it that it would break. As I was installing it I tried to be very careful as it seemed as though the plastic was quite thin.",4
13,"I know they make these with a huge bulb on them now, but I still use the pairs of these I had from 10.5 years ago when my son was born.  I clip my 10 and 4 year olds' nails with these and they are steady and perfect and still clip fine.  Just bought a pair for a new mom-to-be friend, and have gifted them in the past.  These are all you need! And maybe some reading glasses and good light!",5
14,"Buy it! Buttons are nice and soft enough that baby can activate them. She carries this around everywhere. Just watch the toes as it is a bit heavy.",5
15,"My ten month old loves this toy. She is just learning to turn it over and press the different buttons to get the different sounds. It is quite heavy for her little arms though, so she does get frustrated at times. I find the music to be a little but too high-pitched for me, but it is better than many other musical toys we have had. Overall a great purchase.",4
16,"If you're like me you may have gone back and forth between this Graco and the Delta (Novel) playard. I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup--they both take about a minute to put up. The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness--the graco feels lighter than the Delta (a good 5 lbs+), but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up, and seems slightly more durable.Shape--the graco is very squared off, and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape. This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress--the graco has a very bright, colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it. It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable. The pad also lays flat, but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while. The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides. The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco, but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco. Even though it's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier. No dip in the middle, and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh---they both seem to have equally durable mesh. The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price--the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice. I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for. If it's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare, etc. I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use. If you are using it to bring around with you places (hotel, camping, on the back deck, grandma's, etc). then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around, and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with. The graco also seems sturdy and durable; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments; that's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing!!  Wish I had bought one sooner!  We have twins and they both can play in one together without them feeling like they are on top of each other.",4
17,"I bought this for my nine month granddaughter when she comes to visit.  She loves it!  It's practical, sturdy and so easy to set up and take down.  The colors are bright and cheerful and the attached &#34;toys&#34; are so cute&#34;.",5
18,"This was perfect for traveling when my child was under 2. She loved the decorations on it and she was able to play with them. It is larger than an average pack n play, which was nice when she slept.",5
19,"We put this on our coffee table six months ago, all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly. The long strips dont really protect my child much. She will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion. It is not really thick enough or wide enough. Corners are a joke. The tape provided is not sticky enough. Just keeps coming off.",2
20,"These work for small corner surfaces. If you have a large surface to cover, like a table corner, make sure that you cut the strip in half. If you put it on as one long strip it will fall off.  Works good for coffee tables.",4
21,"When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)",1
22,"While I think it's a great fit for the toilet, my daughter won't sit on it for more than a couple minutes, having to adjust every few seconds because she says it &#34;isn't comfy&#34;.  After the great reviews and was actually recommended to me by my sister, it just doesn't work for our daughter.  I'm going to have to buy a cheap padded one I guess.  Stinks that I can't return this thing. Pretty expensive.",2
23,"I love this seat. I have two in my house and this one is my favorite. The kids say it's comfortable and it adjusts to fit the seat. Which is great, since we actually have a round seat in one bathroom and an oval one in the other. I keep this one in the main bathroom, since it's the favorite. Definitely recommend this to anyone who has smaller butts (you know, children) in the house.",5
24,"I tried a few different seats and nothing fit my oval shaped Toto seats well.The adjusters in this allow it to fit the seat perfectly. It's sturdy, and easy to clean.  Hangs perfectly with the potty hook.Great product!",5
25,"It does the job.  She was potty trained within a month I think due to being able to leave this in the livingroom so she could always see it.",5
26,"This is a great training potty for toddlers. It's easy to clean and I like the light color. Very happy!",5
27,"Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty.",5
28,"very nice product",5
29,"The good:It lasted about 6 months and never leakedIt really did fit my tub well and helped the transistion from sink to tub for bathing.The bad:Once it goes.....it goes.  It developed a slow leak on day and went into the trash.  Felt wasteful, after that we decided to bathe our daughter in a rubbermaid bin instead.  So far so good.",3
30,"I didn't want bottles with a ton of moving parts that needed to be washed carefully. Using these allows at least part of the bottle to be clean every time, so you only have to worry about cleaning the nipple (and the bottle base, but that doesn't usually get very dirty at all).",5
31,"I am a big proponent of the Playtex Bottle Liner Drop-ins.  Cleaning bottles becomes limited to cleaning nipples -- a far less difficult task.  They're easy and effective.",5
32,"I like have this organizer, but on our changer (attached to the crib style) it sits just a little loose.",4
33,"This fits perfectly over the side of our Babyletto crib and saves a lot of space. There's more than enough room for disposable diapers and they are very easy to take out and refill.",5
34,"Used it for 1st time today. My 5 month old seem comfortable in it. We just graduated from that 1st year tub (with sling) since he look too big for the other tub.1 less star for the scratches and dirt on the tub when it arrived. But it's good after washing. Well it's a molded plastic. Nothing fancy. Very well shaped though!",4
35,"I wanted something comfortable, safe, and high quality for our 4 month old.  This is a great tub for her getting ready to sit up on her own.  It is big, and takes up almost the whole bathtub, but it beats the others since it creates her own bathtub.  There is plenty of space for her to kick and play. It drains easily and easy to clean.  For the price you will get your deal, especially the end result is a happy baby :)",5
36,"This does not stay on a brick fireplace.  I constantly have to be sticking them back on.  But it's better than nothing.  The corners stick well though.",3
37,"I purchased these bottles for our new baby. I like how durable and easy to sterilize they are also replacement nipples are very affordable also. I like the idea that because the bottles are glass we will be able to use them for future children with the minimal cost of nipple replacement. I am happy with how sturdy they are and have no fear of breaking the glass at all.",5
38,"Used it for more than 4 months and still as good as new. The quality is really good.Got it together with thishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00433OQO6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00433OQO6&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20",4
39,"New parent here. These do not work with our Avent bottles. Who knew there were slightly different sized nipples. Annoying. Have to return and replace.",1
40,"We had a bookshelf in our daughters room that we didn't want her pulling over, and these worked great. Perfect solution, no issues installing.",5
41,"I love how easy this gate is when walking through with my arms full of sleeping baby! It takes a heavy step to open but it's truly baby Proof!",5
42,"I use it as a stool and it's nice. won't slip on any surface. But I guess it will be hard to clean the top.",5
43,"My 2.25 year old daughter loves standing on this in the bathroom and it seems very sturdy and safe.  I wish it was a tad taller or had a step because she still can't quite reach the sink.",4
44,"I ordered this stool for my son. He isn't officially potty training yet, he's still more of a recreational toilet user. So he needed a stool more for hand-washing at the sink and less for climbing onto the toilet. A neighbor recommended this stool to me, saying it wouldn't slide along the floor. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for us.This stool moves easily along the tiles as my son climbs on and off.Also, it is too short for use as a sink stool. He still can't reach the water or the faucet, which frustrates him immensely. I'm sure that next year we will get a lot of use out of this stool, when my son is bigger and is using the toilet in earnest. In the mean time, we will continue to be a bit frustrated.I do appreciate the wide color varieties for this stool. The turquoise color is really nice.",3
45,"works great with my pump n style and allows me to pump on the go when necessary.  Be sure to check the voltage on our your pump before purchasing, some are 9-volt, not 12-volt.",5
46,"My nips were sooo sore and cracked the first weeks after having my baby. These shields saved my life because I was able to put them on and walk around the house without rubbing against my clothes. You can't go outside in public with these, they poke out too much. But they are a good alternative to walking around topless. It's also great that they catch the milk. I was able to freeze and store a lot of the milk that collected in one side while nursing on the other.",5
47,"These are the only bottles my son will use and of course this design is discontinued. I took away a star because I got a pack with 3 pink bottles. Figures. FYI - the Dr. Brown's nipples fit these bottles exactly the same as the Playtex and you can still get those in the store. Way cheaper than trying to find the Playtex ones.",4
48,"Title says it all! I've tried a lot of the other baby bottles: Dr. Brown, Nuk, Tommee Tippee, Born Free, & Avent.These Playtex VentAire are by far my favorite!",5
49,"These are wonderful baby spoons. Just the right size for littlest mouths. I wash them in the dishwasher without issues.  We keep them for a year or longer.",5
50,"You can't beat the price.  I purchased these to take with me on day/ weekend trips.  They were cheap enough so that I wouldn't be upset if I ever lost one.They are much sturdier than I expected for something considered &#34;toss-able.&#34;  I have washed these in my dishwasher twice already and they are holding up great.  There are no unsightly scratches or discoloring.My pack arrived with blue, green, purple, yellow, orange and PINK spoons.  I have a daughter, so, it was a pleasant surprise.The size is perfect for my 9 month old daughter's little mouth.  I have a 3 year old and although it is on the small size for him, it is still large enough for him to get enough food on the spoon and into his mouth.  I would not recommend these spoons for children over the age of 2.The product arrived at my door in 5 days.",5
51,"These worked with the Medela Breast Pump. Two different sizes comes in the box. One size did work with the Natural Flow bottles.",5
52,"I didn't plan on having to pump breast milk, my daughter was of course going to latch with no problems (oh how we plan). So when I got this gift at my baby shower I just smiled and packed it away until she needed to eat solid food.I've been using bottles since she was five days old and this has been a life saver. The vial of water requires some trial and error to make sure the bottle isn't too warm or too cold but other than that no issues.I haven't had as much luck with using it to heat up solid food. It always seems to be a little cool, no matter how much water I put in the vial.",4
53,"I'm not familar with other brands but this works well enough for me. I use filtered water since it will gunk up quickly inside using tap water. I also have to keep a close eye on the bottle because it will go from slightly warm to hot very quickly.",5
54,"This is an pretty good bottle warmer. However, it has a timer and auto-shuts, but there is no alarm to tell you that the milk is ready so it's very easy to burn bottle. I used this with many different types of bottles (e.g., Advent, Playtex, Dr. Brown. etc..) and it works for all of them.I would prefer the Dr Brown warmer below which has certainly more featureshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LLG2W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0035LLG2W&linkCode;=as2&tag;=justckem-20",4
55,"We used this everyday, multiple times a day, for over a year and had no problems at all.  It took a little bit to figure out how much water to use with which bottle, but once we got that down it was simple to put the water in, push the button and a few min. later have a warm bottle for our daughter.  We have used hot tap water to try and warm a bottle and it just takes too long for formula out of the refrigerator.  We never tried heating up food so I can't comment on that part of the warmer.",4
56,"Cute cups for the kids to play with.  Make great bath toys.  Colors are nice.  I would buy as a gift in future",5
57,"These cups are a favorite in my house. dishwasher safe and colorful- so we always have a couple on hand to keep my son occupied, even during mealtime since they can be cleaned easily",5
58,"Baby loves to nest and stack and throw these cups.  He likes to put other toys in them and dump them out.  These are a dry toy for us, but note that the bottoms all have little cutouts to drain and won't hold water very well for tubby play.  I have a set for the diaper bag, and can pull them out for play or to hold dry snacks.  Great value.  Only downside is there is no strap to keep them all together in a bag or toy box, so i use a fat rubber band.  Hold up fine in the dishwasher.",5
59,"Just be warned...these cups have holes in the bottom. I bought them thinking the largest could double as a bathing cup...but they all have holes. That said, the baby likes them and they're fine for the price.",3
60,"Classic toy that my daughter plays with all the time.  When she was younger she loved to knock down the stacks of cups we would build for her.  Now that she is older (15 months) she loves to nest the cups inside one another.  They are great in her water table as well and I'm sure will be just as fun in sand.  The 2 smallest cups are pretty small and will most likely get lost under furniture, but such is life with a toddler.",5
61,"This is a great toybox. However, 3 pieces came damaged. replacement of the pieces was easy - you order it online. The pieces came damaged because not enough protective packaging was used. Nonetheless, once all the replacement pieces arrived, it was easy to assemble.",5
62,"This is a great tub when they grow out of the infant tub but can't quite sit well enough for the large tub reliably. I am about to retire it because he wants to be in the large tub now but it served it's purpose well and was worth the price. He loves playing with it to hear the bean bag sounds and loves that Leachco tag on the side.We hung it to dry in the shower nightly and never noticed any mildew/mold and it dried quickly. The only downside of this vs an inflatable is that when he pooped in the tub once it was difficult to clean out. That was the only time I wasn't happy.",5
63,"The tub I purchased was a complete waste of money. This was a lifesaver for when my boy couldn't sit up safely on his own. It just needs to be rinsed out well and hung to dry in a well ventilated area to avoid it getting moldy.",4
64,"This is very thin. I wanted something that I could  bathe my new baby on next to my three-year-old in the tub. I wouldn't have been able to use more than 2 inches of water with this. Not for us...",3
65,"I like this infant bath pad because it holds my son well, has ample cushion, is soft, and easy to use.  I highly recommend it.",5
66,"This was just the special and helpful gift I was looking for. I bought it for a baby shower so I don't know yet how the mother and baby likes it, but I think they will. Very soft with a convenient hang-up hook so it can dry. Seems to be made well. I wish I had something like this when my son was a baby!",5
67,"My LO loves to eat with these spoons! and believe I've tried with others and he doesn't like it. Is true they are a little big bigger but if my LO loves them I love them!",5
68,"This was an amazing find for my granddaughter! She truly loves bright colors and I am so excited that it worked so well! Low spillage",5
69,"it is such a beautiful and stylish frame. I expected smaller size and was gladly surprised that it is a medium size. Looks great in a baby room.",5
70,"I was happy to find a diaper disposal system that worked well with cloth diapers.  It usually fills up just as I am ready to do diaper laundry, so it has a great capacity.  We used the disposable liners that came with it until I ran out, and then used the re-usable cloth liners that I purchased separately.  Both were very easy to use, and helped to keep our nursery stink-free.  If you go back and forth with cloth and disposable, or plan to do one and then the other, this is a great option, as you can use it easily for both options, as opposed to the Munchkin or Diaper Genie, which are much harder to use with cloth.",5
71,"We purchased this when for our nursery. Honestly, I originally wanted this one because it looked nicer than the other pails, and the white and grey went with our nursery. However, now that we've been using it for 6 months, I really love how function it is.Pros:-No smell. I empty this thing maybe once a week (sometimes longer if I'm lazy) and I never smell the dirty diapers. We are into eating solids now, too ... and if you have a baby you know what I'm talking about.-Easy to empty. I love that I can just open the bottom, pull the bag out, cut it off, and the new bag is already loaded and waiting. The bags also hold a lot of diapers. I haven't counted, so I can't tell you exactly how many, but like I mentioned above, I only empty it once a week.-Locking lid. There's a lock on the lid to prevent little hands from getting into the trash. Our baby is only 6 months so I haven't had to worry about this yet, but she's crawling and into everything, so I'm sure it's not far off.-Looks nice. It really does look like a nice diaper pail. Also, the narrow width makes it perfect to fit between our dresser/changing table and the wall.-Refills last forever. The refills are pricier than some others, I'm sure, but they last forever. I've only replaced the bag once and that was around 3-4 months.Cons:-No indicator of when the bag refill is close to the end of the roll. This is really my only complaint. I think I read a review somewhere that suggested putting a pink line or some marker on the refill bags so you know when it's almost out. It hasn't caused me any problems yet, but it would be helpful to know when I'm almost out of bag.-The lid sticks up sometimes, and doesn't close all the way. I'm not sure if this is because it's sitting on plush carpet and not on a hard surface or what, but the lid doesn't always fully shut. Not a big deal because there's a second lid underneath that covers the diapers, but it's an annoyance. I realize I'm being picky here, but I needed at least two cons, right?Overall, this is a really great diaper pail. I've recommended it to all my pregnant friends.",5
72,"Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of traditional Playtex sippy cups. They truly are the gold standard. They last forever, don't leak, and are cute as well. This new line that they came out with is just terrible. After 2 washings they leak all over the place. I don't know whether it's the new valves or the cup lids themselves, but they are completely useless. I'm stalking other sites to find the originals so I can stock up because these new ones are a disaster.",1
73,"Bought this in my third trimester, if you turn a lot during in your sleep, this is not a pillow for you. Because every time you change the position, you have to move the pillow the other way, oh my specially when you are already barely moving yourself, pillow is more like being hassle than making you comfortable.",1
74,"If you're pregnant, buy this pillow right this second. I couldn't have gotten through my pregnancy without it. So comfy and helps me sleep so good!!",5
75,"Pros: felt soo much better sleeping with this than just stacks of random pillows.Cons:1) we had a full/queen bed and between myself and this pillow my poor husband had virtually no space. he was a trooper though and never complained!2) By the end of my pregnancy I felt that I had flattened the head portion to the point it wasn't helping very much. For this it gets 4 stars. It is promoted to be more firm of a pillow than the Boppy or other competing brands. It started out that way for sure but I smothered it to death, and now it is limp. For a lot of people they may not feel this way or be as picky as me but I LOVE extra firm pillows. So if you are like me you may keep this in mind.3) Removing the case and washing it is a giant pain in the behind. That was a battle I was determined to win because clean linens are my happy place.All in all, it was still worth the purchase and gave me MANY good nights sleep. Just be aware, it may not last to your firm standards or leave space for your partner in the bed. I would buy it again, and just might have to with another pregnancy to keep the firmness I prefer.",4
76,"I had a love-hate relationship with this pillow throughout my pregnancy.  I hated sleeping on my side, and I unfairly blamed a lot of it on the pillow, but the pillow wasn't to blame.  It is large and took up most of our queen size bed, but really came in handy, especially toward the end of my pregnancy.  Also, the cover is zippered and washable, but a pain to take off and put back on.",4
77,"i cannot sleep with out this pillow!so comfortable!!!one &#34;eh&#34; quality is i was mine a lot and ita a pain in the neck to take the pillow case on and off.",5
78,"saving assistance, as they should not buy these again, I never noticed anything in the bra, or in the clothes",5
79,"Soft and the right size.  I do wish they would stop making nursing pads round and make them a little more breast shaped so you cant see them thru a shirt but so far every ones are still round.  They aren't too think but you can see them thru a thin shirt.",4
80,"This is the most boring thing one can have in the nursery! Waiting for it to fall and break and buy a different one.Although looks arent of concern then its a good buy!",2
81,"it moves around a lot.but it does what it's supposed to.having a wipes case on top weighs it down a bit, which is good.all in all, not a great idea to have all this stuff on the counter where the baby loves to reach for it and play.",4
82,"I really love this item, but I got parts of it broken. this why I am giving it a 2 star. I would have return it but in the long run it will cost me to much time and money.",2
83,"I love every aspect about this tub!",5
84,"He's not too big, so this one is just perfect for him. guess I'll need a bigger one after 6 months or so.",5
85,"I love this tub! It really does fit baby from newborn on up.  I have an exceptionally large boy (we just grow 'em tall in my family!), so I don't think he'll fit in it as long as most kids, but for newborns through 9mo it should work great.  He is 4 months now, and about the size of an average 7-8 month old, and he is using the &#34;toddler&#34; side sitting up (he already can sit up on his own for the most part).  He won't fit in it for way longer, but since he's sitting so well that's fine.This is very well constructed, and the bump in the middle really helps keep him from sliding around like I've had trouble with in some tubs.I would definitely suggest this to all new parents!",5
86,"I bought this for my daughter's new baby. She reports back to me that she likes it  and their baby loves his baths in it now that he is 5 months old.",4
87,"Love the concept of the sling. Also love that it has a spout - it makes it very easy to use.I did not realize that this would sit easily over the sink. Makes life really easy. Highly recommended product.",5
88,"It has been a couple of months that I have used the tub. I used the sling for a day or two, it was not very comfortable using the sling. Baby ended up slouching on the sling and hard to move around.  Without the sling, bath time was a two man's job since one person had to support the baby's body and head while the other person bathed the baby. Now that the baby is older and is able to control her head, it has been a lot more easier using the tub.",4
89,"I had a blue one of these for my first few kids years ago. Just bought this one to replace it for my daughter who will be born soon. It's the same one...different color. I didn't care to try the pricey ones with all kinds of features. This one worked just fine and I was happy with it. I'm sure I will be again. One side is perfect for babies, the other for toddlers. Easy to keep clean. Cheap and works great. Couldn't ask for more from a baby tub.",5
90,"THIS IS A GREAT PRORUCT. It seemed a little long but helped my daughter get used to silicone bottle nipple before I went back to work.",4

95,"This pillow is a comfy place for the baby to sit while also being a comfortable nursing pillow. I actually didn't use it very long for a nursing pillow because we had some latch issues that required unique positioning but the time that I did use it for that was great. My favorite part is the strap that hold the baby. This is a feature you won't on other nursing pillows. I've used two others and this is my favorite. And you can't beat the price!",5
96,"I use it more for baby to lay on, she loves it - I'm so happy I got this and use it constantly . I'm bottle feeding so I'm not sure how good it is for nursing, but it's great for baby to lay on and look around, she does tummy time on ot too, and the seatbelt strap is great, keeps her from slipping - she's a squirm worm and only 6 weeks. She's laying on it right now as I type! :)",5

98,"I wished I had one of these when I had my son 2 years ago from all the backaches from not sitting up straight while breastfeeding. I cam across this and decided to buy for my newborn baby and I loved it. I used it nursing and also to put her in to keep her head up",5
99,"When it arrived I know I am satisfied with this pillow. It soft & thick. I like the purpose of the belt too. It is added for baby's support & safety. Unfortunately, there is no cover sheet available. Just wipe it with wet cloth & you will be fine.",5
100,"These are no where near the same quality as the Playtex VentAire Wide Bottle. I thought they were at least in the same family but I was completely wrong. The universal nipples that Playtex makes for all their bottles do not fit on these bottles. Also there are no meterings on the side so there's no way to know how much milk is in the bottle. These were so far from what we wanted we didn't even use them and ended up donating them to charity.However, you don't have to look too far to find the perfect bottle and they are somewhat related. The Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set is exactly what you want. They are so good in fact we went back and bought another set.ALSO BUYER BEWARE EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER USED THESE BOTTLES AMAZON WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO RETURN THEM!",1

If I leaked more I'd be really concerned because I just don't see how these would hold up. When I push them aside to nurse they ball up and I can't really reuse them. I like the avent so much better (softer, not crinkly, absorbent and actually hold up). I wouldn't spend the $ on these ever even if they were the only option.",1

We live in Florida so even though we have the A/C we just needed a light blanket and we loved the HALO swaddle bags but needed something bigger.We bought a cute one at IKEA that did not last long (the zipper broke), very disappointing, so got back with HALO. Do not regret it at all. Cotton is very soft of great quality even after weekly wash/dry. Zipper is still fully functioning. Like new after 2+ months!",5

112,"I purchased this because my little guy was breaking out of the swaddle and I didn't feel comfortable with him and a free blanket in the crib. The sleep sack keeps him warm, and he sleeps well.

Its fantastic! She loves being right at the table with us and it is VERY sturdy! Can't say enough good things about it",5
126,"Easy installation, fit perfectly on a bar top style section of seating in the kitchen. My only complaint is that at my son's age/height, the bar in the back of the frame is right across the back of his head, so to be comfortable he has to lean his head forward. It just looks uncomfortable. The back is not firm or solid, so that also adds to the problem. Perhaps if the back was firm and at the same depth as the bar there wouldn't be an issue. It wipes clean and is easy to install /uninstall and I feel its safe. My son just doesn't eat well in it and I believe it's because he's uncomfy.",3
127,"I wanted an easy to use travel seat.  This seat does not fold up as easily as I expected--you have to dismantle it and remove the arms in order to take the seat apart and get it to lay flat.  That's a step that I wasn't expecting.  On our first use, it would not attach securely to the table that we were at.  I could get it on the table, but the angle between the part that goes above and below the table did not allow for the seat to be pushed forward toward the table enough so that the seat was secure.  The seat might have been safe, but I didn't trust it, and in any case, there would have been a large gap between the baby and the table and I'm sure any food would have went straight into that gap onto baby's lap or the floor.I wish I would have spent a few dollars more and gotten the chicco seat that my friends have.  That seat works very well and folds flat with ease.  This seat was not a good purchase.",2
128,"I bought this to replace my greco high chair because it took up a lot of space. I knew I was going to use it mainly at the house and when we stay with relatives so the 2&#34; max was fine. My baby was 5 months old when we first started using it but I would recommend using it on a baby who can fully sit up (maybe 6 or 7 months) because there is no support. My baby is pretty average size and the chair puts his face just at the ledge of the table. He hasn't hit his face yet but it is probably going to happen. I just make sure not to put him in it when he's sleepy or mad. I don't think it is cheaply made or ugly, it's a high chair for under $20, it does what it is supposed to.",4
129,"I have been holding onto this item for so long now.  I have not sent it back because I have not had the time,  However, I have not used it because it does not feel very secure and doesn't fit to any of my tables or restaurants, etc.  The material annoys me.  Although it seems easy to clean, it's very cheap.  However, I new that the item was inexpensive and tried my luck.  It just sits at the bottom of my stairs staring at me each morning waiting for me to return it.",2
130,"We bought this thinking that we would prefer its high back to the Phil and Teds lobster chair. Though this was much less expensive, the material is cheap and the unit was annoying to set up. It didn't fit either of our tables, so back it goes.",2
131,"We love this versatile gate. We needed something that would fit a little bit smaller doorway, and this one is perfect! We love that it can be permanently installed or just on an as needed basis. We have used it both ways and have been very pleased with the results. It is simple to operate one handed as long as you know what you are doing, sometimes we need to help guests figure it out. But that means children will not be able to operate it! The clear plastic window makes it less of an eye sore and my son could peek through from one side or the other and stay safe from the stairs.",5
132,"For a few dollar difference, get the deluxe version.  I like the lid to the tray.  It keeps the tray clean in between uses.  The other feature the deluxe version has is the height adjustable seat.  It has 3 heights.  I like to use the tallest so my 9 month old sits closer to me.  We keep it in the car and use it at restaurants and when visiting relatives.At 9 month my kid likes to watch us eat and we feed him little bits of our food when we eat out to keep him entertained.  He likes the seat.  It let's us eat in relative peace.I also have a high chair cover but I prefer to use our own booster chair because it's more clean and the tray is useful to put his cheerios on which he can eat himself.  He isn't old enough to reach for food on the regular table from a high chair so the booster is more useful for now.  Once he is older I think restaurant high chairs will be fine.",5
133,"Perfect booster seat for my 9 month old.  Fits firmly on our wooden kitchen chairs.  Easy to install and stays in place.  The tray and seat is very easy to clean!  Highly recommended.",5
134,"This chair is great for a portable - folds easily down to take with you has a carry strap. Seems sturdy on the chair or table.",4
135,"i GOT TWO OF THESE FOR MY TWIN GRANDSONS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD.  THEY FUNCTION AS DESCRIBED AND THEIR 8 MONTH OLD SISTER CAN USE IT TOO.  THEY WERE EASY TO INSTALL AND FIT SECURELY ON BOTH MY DINING ROOM CHAIRS AND A STANDARD FOLDING CHAIR.  THEY TAKE UP LESS SPACE THAN A TRADITIONAL HIGHCHAIR WHICH MAKES THEM EASIER TO USE IN MY HOME. THE TRAYS ARE SMALLER THAN A STANDARD HIGH CHAIR, BUT I DON'T SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE TRAY HAS A CUP HOLDER - THAT'S THE ONE WE USE THE MOST.",5
136,"Love these.  Best thing I ever got. Use them for my twin grandsons ain't my small kitchen.  Easy to set up and take down.  The twins are two now and have been using these since they could sit up.  Easy to clean.  I sewed two towels together and put it over the back of the chairs to minimize those grimy hands.  We take these camping and when we visit friends and family.  There are three hieght adjustments and folds up to take anywhere.  Nice to have for many years!",5
137,"I got this to keep on one of our dining chairs permanently until our son is old enough to sit on a regular chair. Our table is black with tan cushions and this chair looks great with it, because it blends with the colors perfectly. And it has 3 different height options, which we currently have on the highest setting, so we have plenty of room to grow in it. For reference, my son is probably about 35 inches tall.",5
138,"I think my biggest issue with this chair is that my baby is very uncomfortable in it. He would scream every time I tried to put him in it. I ended up buying a regular high chair with a padded seat and he has no problem sitting in it (though he has no problem sitting in hard restaurant high chairs). He's 6 months old now, so perhaps when he's older he'll like it more. The only advantages of the fisher price booster seat are that it's very portable, inexpensive, and might be good for people with don't have an extra 2 feet of space for a high chair. But it doesn't matter how portable or inexpensive it is if your baby hates it.",2
139,"We have the older model for my son, so we knew we wanted to get this Deluxe version for our daughter.  I like that the seat back is now curved and I like the detachable tray plate and cover.  Our 7 month old is still a little small for it, so I just rolled up a couple of receiving blankets to stick in next to her and we're all set to go!  I love how little space this uses!",5
140,"We have a small kitchen, so a booster seat was a better option for us than a stand-alone highchair.  We had a fabric one before that clipped to the table, but it didn't work on all tables and the soft fabric seat was a nightmare to clean.  The molded plastic seat on this has no crevices, so there's no worrying about food getting stuck down in it.  I just wipe it clean with a wet cloth after mealtime.  We use it both with the tray and just up next to the table and it works well both ways. It's easy to strap to any standard chair and comes off really fast if we need the chair.The two cons: My baby very quickly figured out that he could pry the white liner away from the tray and drop it on the floor, food and all, so we just stopped using it. We put the food directly on the beige part of the tray and just wash it by hand (though I would think it could also go in the dishwasher if you wanted).  Also, when we use it without the tray and have him at the table, he can reach the safety straps and has gotten food all over them.  Unlike the seat, the straps are not easy to clean!  A wet cloth has not done the trick and they are stained and kind of gross.  With the tray snapped on he can't reach the straps, so it's only because we used it without that this happened.  I still love the seat and would recommend it to anyone.  Wonderful product for the price-- don't waste your money on a stand-alone high chair!",4
141,"I bought this chair in January 2014 and have been using it everyday ever since.  My daughter is 10 months old now and the chair hasn't fallen apart or broken off.  My husband and I love the fact that this comes with its own removable feeding tray.  Easy to wash.  My older daughter, who is 7 years old now, had the blue/green one.  She still could fit it at 2 - 3 years old but gave it away to a relative who needed a few years ago.  Really love this seat.  I am short on space so I needed something really compact and this chair fit the bill.",5
142,"I've been waiting to write this review until my grandson got to try this out. We'll folks, he loves it! The first thing he did was remove the opaque cover and look at us through it. Granted that isn't what the cover is intended for, but hey whatever makes the little ones happy while you're preparing their food, right?The quality appears to be sturdy and assembly was very easy. I did not have any trouble securing the straps or putting the tray on.",5
143,"Can't beat this seat. Versatile. We have two for both kids. I always pop the tray in the dishwasher. Would recommend.",5
144,"I gave this five stars as this is the third one I've purchased.  I purchased one for myself, one for each of my grandchildren who's parents have counter height tables and the grandchildren are too big for their high chairs.  I originally purchased this one for our granddaughter (since we too have a counter height kitchen table) who was 9 months and it was perfect for her!  Now that our grandchildren are 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 it is perfect for them still.  I HIGHLY recommend this for grandparents, people who do not have children as it is so handy to pull out and use for company that has little one/toddlers.  The seat conveniently folds up and has a strap for throwing it over your shoulder if you're going to someone's home that doesn't have a high chair/booster seat.  Fisher-Price has done it again!",5
145,"I ended up loving this little booster seat even more than I thought I would. I use it instead of a full size high chair.The tray has adjustments as to how far back against the baby it can go. When he first started using it, I put the tray the whole way back. At 9 months old, he is at the next notch. By the time it would be too tight against him, he would be using it without the tray, jut as a booster at the table, so the amount of notches for adjustments is perfect.You can raise and lower the seat in the base as well. So far, I have kept it at the highest height and that has worked perfect for sitting it on a chair as a booster - at the highest height, I am still able to slide the whole seat with the tray on it, under the table while it is on the chair. Of course this will vary depending on your own table and chair heights.I love that I can just move this around so easily from room to room. He can use it to sit and watch tv in the living room or just sit in like a big boy chair. I can sit it on the kitchen counter while I cook or clean and have him right there. There are rubber pads on the bottom of the base, so it won't slide around. I can sit it on  top of the table to feed him while I sit on the dining chair, or bring it in the living room and set it on the floor and it is still high enough to be comfortable to feed him while I sit on the floor.At first I bought this thinking that it would just be a temporary or once in a while item that I would use. But now, I can definitely see using it instead of a full size high chair for as long as he fits in it. I would think it would fit him up until the time he would be sitting on a regular dining chair on his own. It has so much more potential for use than a full size high chair, since you can move it around to pretty much anywhere.It is a decent size. Not too big and not too small. It doesn't take up much space at all. Storing it away is as simple as sitting it on a dining chair and pushing the chair under the table as usual.It is easy to clean - no fabric to worry about. Trays can go right in the dishwasher if you want.It is sturdy enough. I am not concerned that anything will crack or break.The color scheme is very neutral and nice looking.Price is definitely good and I feel like it is such a great value since it is such a versatile item. Definitely one of the best baby products I have chosen and I am so glad I bought it.",5
146,"I returned this seat due to a defective strap (one of the straps that attaches the seat to the back of the chair came out of the seat with the slightest tug). I also did not like that this seat did not fit our dining table chairs. I was surprised about the defect because we've been using the Fisher Price Space Saver chair and have been very pleased with it. This booster seat was supposed to be a replacement for the Space Saver, and as a second chair to use on trips (since it folds, which the Space Saver does not). The tray on this seat is very small compared to the Space Saver. In my opinion it is a far poorer product, although to be fair it is significantly cheaper. In any case, I have returned it and am not asking for a replacement. Would rather find something else.",1
147,"We got this seat since we have a small kitchen and have heard from other friends that their full sized high chair took up too much space.  The tray is easy to remove and clean (dishwasher safe too) I can get DS in and out of the seat fairly quickly. I like how securely it fastens to our chair at the table.This booster folds up nicely and can easily be taken with you if you plan on going out to eat.  The only downside with this is they  tray can become loose with little hands. My lil guy somehow got his fingers btwn the white tray and the blue tray attachment and couldn't get his finger unstuck and started to cry. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I looked down. I will be vigilant of that next time we use it, but otherwise, really great system.",4
148,"The seat buckles are on the bottom part of the bum on this one, unlike the red version.  Id ont' like that becuase my son can lean all the way forward.  He wouldn't fall out but it still seems dangerous because he can lean over a lot farther.  I have to always keep the tray in to make sure he doesn't lean over so much.",2
149,"I bought this for my brother's family. They were living with my parents for a few months due to family health issues, and their baby was quickly outgrowing his bouncy chair. They didn't want to invest in a high chair when they'd be moving across country in a few months, so I picked this up for them.  The baby, 6 months old, loved it and they loved it because it allowed the baby to sit at the table, the same height as us, and enjoy the dinner time while giving mom and dad a chance to eat, too.  They said they might not even buy a high chair they like this so much. The baby does need to be able to sit up by himself for this seat to work.",4
150,"We used this at the top of the stairway for extra wide stairs.  It was the only gate we could find with good reviews that also fit the size of the opening.  The slide lever to open and close the gate is a little tough at times on your way up the stairs with a baby in your arms, but you get used to it.",4

152,"I had no idea how often I was supposed to be changing these out.  I use my pump three times a week (work in an office those days) and wasn't changing these out.  Our area La Leche League leaders suggested I change them out when I wasn't getting as much while pumping, and it made a huge difference.  I now change them out at least once a month.",5
153,"These fit perfectly and we're super easy to put on my seats. I have 4 grandchildren and the backs of my car seats were always dusty with shoe prints. These have eliminated that problem.",5
154,"Probably will be very handy once child can hold and subsequently drop/spill things.  Also may (my theory) protect from the carseat base abrading the seat fabric.Pros:  Not much to it.  Simple.  Fairly thick.Cons:  Not much to it.  A couple of, in my opinion, poorly placed pockets (if this is designed to protect from drops/spills, why are there pockets for bottles and things you'd probably want kept clean?  Maybe this product photo would benefit from replacing the toys and bottles (things that will enter the baby's mouth) with a pack of wipes.  :)",4
155,"I am happy with this. I wanted a moses basket but did not want to spend a lot since you can only use them for such a short time. I got this since it was inexpensive. It obviously is not the highest quality out there but it is good for the price!",5
156,"We love this!  It's very easy to install, break down and strong.  We took it camping and put down foam pad, little one had a blast.

Highly recommended for your little one, husband or pet that you need to control.",5

My concern with this pen is that it's not as sturdy as I thought it would be. She's less than 20 lbs but when she uses it to stand it causes it to sway. We're looking into ways to make it more secure but I thought I would mention it for others looking to pen their children.",3
161,"A few years ago I bought this same play yard at Walmart but only 4 panels. I wanted to be able to add more panels to make a huge play yard for our grand son to play safely in our back yard. I like the plastic better than the metal expen type play yards .",4
162,"After our toddler outgrew this babyjail, we actually started using it for her bed.  We put a mattress in the middle and let her sleep in it.  It's better than her toddler bed because our toddler can't get out, so it forces her to sleep instead of sneaking off and playing somewhere else in the room, plus we know she is safe in there.  Overall, we definitely got our money's worth and then some.",4

He really enjoyed the play area. Now, three years later, we are still using the set in our home, visiting family or when on vacation. Plus we have two more little boys. This set has really lasted and my almost 4 year old still can't climb over it. If you are planning on using this past the first year I would highly recommend buying two and linking them together as this will be plenty of space.",5
164,"I bought this to add to some old panels and was glad they are compatible, as one panel did not get fully assembled.  The first customer service person was downright rude, but the second time I called, I was helped by a courteous woman who agreed to send a replacement panel as it was unclear which part(s) were missing.  I have yet to receive the new panel and that part is frustrating.  The product is well constructed and compatible with a set I had purchased for dogs years ago.  The mechanism used to separate is a tad tricky to do initially, but after a few tries we had success.",2

169,"I bought this seat thinking that the underside was textured to keep it from slipping off the chair.  I was wrong.  The underside is not textured but the seat where the child sits is textured to keep the child in it.  I don't like that the seat does not have something to keep it from sliding off the chair though.  We put our son in a chair with arms to help because if we didn't we felt like he might fall out of the chair because he does tend to move around a little while he's seated at the table.  It is a nice seat and very good quality but we just wish it were a little more secure in the chair.  If your little one doesn't really move around at the table then I would highly recommend it because it really is nice for the price.",4

It cannot simply be wiped clean but rather because of the textured surface on the bottom it needs a good scrubbing in the sink at the end of the day. It doesn't fit entirely in our sink so I end up making quite a mess cleaning it every night. Other than that, it's a good booster at a decent price.",3

The back panels you are supposed to screw into the frame did not line up completely. Screwing into fiberboard or chipboard, whichever it is called made it just split apart and now there are 3 places on the inside of the drawer tower that i have to hot glue back together.

The bib doesn't fit my baby while he's sitting in the highchair because the bib is too long and there isn't enough of a gap between my baby and the high chair tray for the bib to rest. It ends up resting at an angle on top of the tray. It also makes it impossible for himn to bend forward to reach food on his tray because this bib gets in the way.

I found esp since the food they were eating was mostly pureed that this wasn't that helpful for them.  A cloth bib would do just as well and I could wipe their faces more easily with a cloth bib or napkin.  However, from about 10 months, I started giving them more foods to feed themselves with, and with spoons starting around 12 months and these were a lifesaver.  So easy to clean and they stopped flipping them over their head as much, though I did find that these days (15 months) they are now putting food in their mouths, and spitting it out, and then save the food in their bib for a snack later on in the meal.  it's pretty gross but I guess I should be happy they're eating more.",5

I imagine you could screw them tight enough to prevent this, but at that point I would have trouble getting the cap back off.

I promise you if you buy these bottles you will not regret it.With metered markings on the side that are easy to read in ounces and milliliters, angled bottles making it easy for feeding, the vent air prevents excess air being swallowed, which really does help a lot! Also they are compatible with any nipples made by playtex which is really handy though the nipples that came with the bottles are our son's favorite!In a bottle warmer they do take a little longer to warm up as much of the heat is conducted by the base and some water does enter in the crack between the bottle and the base. Just be sure to wipe off the bottle and dump any trapped water and you'll be fine, as long as little hands don't touch the base which can get pretty hot.",5
213,"I used these bottles with my son back in 2011. We first used the Gerber Nuk bottles, but they did not work for us. So, when I became pregnant with my second it was a no brainer of which bottles to use! They do have a few more parts than &#34;regular&#34; bottles, but I did not mind! When the new baby got here, she first would not take the nipple, it seemed to long for her mouth! So, I slowly introduced them to her. She finally  got to where she would take it with no problems. I was hand washing them every night, but eventually went to putting them in the dishwasher. I noticed when hand washing and putting them in the dishwasher, that if the slightest bit of water was in the bottom ring, between the ring and the blue &#34;stopper&#34;, it would leak! I never had this problem with the old design! The bottles used to NEVER leak, I was highly disappointed!Pros:* They really do help with gas on the tummy, never had a colic baby, so I am not too sure about that.* The wide bottle is very comfortable in my hand!* Very simple to clean and make sure all the soap is out! (I highly recommend the Playtex bottle brush! Other brands seemed to scratch the inside of the bottle!)Cons:* The new design leaks!* The caps are hard to snap on, to me at least.I have stayed loyal to Playtex and started using the Playtex nursers!",2
214,"This works well on-the-go as an alternate pump if you are not guaranteed to have an electric outlet -- or if you simple don't want to lug around the much heavier Medela electric pumps. The pump is very effective. Expect to have sore and cramped arms the first few times. After your muscles become acclimated to the motion, it's quite handy and fast. The ergonomic design is decent. The base bottle holder is excellent. It's a drag having your bottle fall over because it's attached to a pump. They should include the base with the motorized pumps too.",5

216,"if you're like me and&#8230;you were uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public at first because you were a first-time momyou were bursting at the seams because you were bottle feeding in public since the thought of public breastfeeding gave you anxiety because it seemed overwhelming (nursing cape, nipple shield, bib, burp cloth, wrestle with nursing bra and positioning baby)get it and stick it in your diaper bag to pump while your spouse or BD (or whomever) is driving to make up for the missed nursing sessions.but then i finally got over it and became a pro at breastfeeding a few months in. and now it is abandoned and unused. so was it worth it? probably not. but if you're struggling a ton in the beginning, it might be worth it to you.",4
217,"Whenever I traveled when I was nursing, I used this pump while on the plane (under a nursing cover). It was much easier to use than my electric pump in that setting because it requires less set up/break down, and much more discreet because it didn't sound like a bull frog :)Only complaint is that it can be quite top heavy if not full (and can be tipped easily even if the bottle is full) so you want to be very careful once milk is in the bottle to not let it topple over (and thus spill precious breast milk and make a mess).",5
218,"I already have a Medela Pump In Style Advanced (electric double pump) for when I'm at work, but I found that it was a hassle to use at home for just a quick pump (it is fantastic for when I'm at work though).So I decided I'd get a hand pump to use at home, simpler, and something I could use while also feeding him, no tubing etc etcI was very disappointed with the suction on this pump...I guess I'm just used to the electric pump? I mean I knew it wouldn't be as good as that, but I feel like it hardly gets anything out at all.  I can get 3 ounces out of each side in 10 minutes with my electric pump, and it takes me 15 mins to get an ounce out of both sides combined with this one.I've never used a manual pump before this one, so maybe it's a lot better than some, but it definitely wasn't what I had hoped for.It is very nicely made, I haven't had any problems with it breaking, and it cleans up really easily.  I see some people complain about it hurting their hands...my hands certainly tire out eventually, but I found the handle to be very comfortable to use.",3
219,"I don't hate this thing, but it doesn't work for me. I have an electric medela pump in style as well as a manual tommee tippee pump. I purchased this hoping to have an extra pump solely to keep in the car for frequent family road trips. I wanted something more convenient than lugging around the electric, and that would &#34;fold&#34; down smaller than the tommee tippee. Of the 3 pumps this one by far breaks down to be the smallest, so it is very easy to toss in a purse or diaper bag to take with you without being all, &#34;Hey! That lady is lugging around a breast pump!&#34; The grip on this pump is comfortable and easy to squeeze. The fact that it rotates is handy and annoying at the same time. You aren't stuck with it being in an uncomfortable position, but as you're pumping it can keep sliding around, making it hard to maintain a rhythm. I like that it will accept the other medela breast shields, since I need a larger size than what is supplied with the pump. My larger shields just press in to the connector the same way my electric pump does. This pump also uses the same valves and membranes as the electric so I can easily swap them out should I tear one while cleaning. The problem I have with this pump is that there just isn't enough suction for my personal needs. The only way I could get any milk out was when I was overly full, bordering on complete engorgement. (So...toward the very early morning hours when I had very little motivation to actually do any pumping.) I could pump and pump knowing full well there was milk still there for the taking, but not getting anything (or VERY little) out. After it not working, I could switch to either of my other 2 pumps and get the several ounces that I could feel was there all along. I tend to use my electric pump at a higher setting, and the opening of the tommee tippee breast shield is so small that it contributes to the good suction I can get with that pump.  Keeping that in mind I experimented and used the smaller sized medela shield that came with this pump and had a little better success at getting milk out, but the trade off was sore, scuffed up nipples, so in the end I went back to using the pumps I already owned rather than risk any more damage to my body.  I was so disappointed that this didn't work for me, but I do think it's a high quality product.",3
220,"I love having the option and convenience of this handheld pump in situations where I need to pump a small amount or just one side and don't want to go through the whole set-up of my electronic pump. It's nice to keep this pump ready to go during night-time feedings so that if baby only feeds from one side, I can easily pump the other side. Took a few tries to get used to holding it and to become efficient, but now I'm very fast with it. Good pump strength mimics electric pump if you have a good seal with the breast shield. Easy to clean and easy to use - definitely recommend for breastfeeding moms!",5
221,"This is my third Medela Harmony... They are AMAZING while they work, but all three suddenly lost suction. I couldn't figure out why but thanks to the reviews here, I discovered the problem - the pesky o ring.  I ordered a new pump at the end of May and that tiny white piece was gone the first week of June.  When I called Medela, the customer support woman told me it's for &#34;occasional use only&#34; and that once a day for 15 minutes is considered to be too much.  They also have no plans to sell the o rings separately or provide extras with the pump.  &#34;The piece is too small to track, count, etc.&#34;  After 15 minutes she agreed to send me a new valve piece since I was still under the 30 day warranty.  I plan on going to Ace and getting a bunch of o rings to have in case this happens again.*I tried the dental floss trick - it worked!  Just make sure you're using a waxy floss and wrap it tightly around in the indentation where the o ring would go.  Such a great short-term fix.  Thanks for the suggestion!",2

Easy to change (I use it with the same company's changing pad which I also recommend).  What angers me about this product was that I received the blue one with a big stain on it.  It had clearly been used and returned.  I feel quality control/returns should have caught this rather than sending it out to me used and stained.  The rest of the nursery is heavy on blue, but no blue was available for the exchange so I ended up with green.  Pretty, but a bit annoying. On top of that, I felt nickeled and dimed by Amazon because I had to pay a negligible amount (cents) because the green was priced slightly higher than the blue I originally ordered.  Given the error was not my fault that made things worse.  The blue was pretty and would have been much preferred had it actually been new!  However, I do love the green new changing pad cover, and the pad cover, regardless of color, is highly recommended.",4
227,"I purchased this before our little one was born.  The fabric is very soft and it fit my changing pad perfectly. I only had one cover which I didn't think was a problem until I realized that baby's grandparents and the sitter couldn't change a poopy diaper without it ending up all over the cover.  After washing it almost everyday I broke down and purchased another. The first one us held up well to the 24/7 use and constant washing!",5
228,"When the changing pad cover arrived, I was surprised to see that it was more of a bright lime green than the soft sage the picture shows. Its a good cover and it serves its purpose well, but if I had known that the color was more bright than soft, I would have gone with a different color.",3

231,"These are a must if you are starting out or have been making baby food! Shopped around and like these the most. No nasty plastic made in china. Good sturdy safe material. Not sure about other posts about ease of getting food out bc it was super simple for me. I bought 1set of 2 to try out and then loved them so I bought another set. To get food out simply let it set on the counter for a couple mins or run water along the backside. You don't even need warm water, i just turned on the water and ran it along the back of the tray and you can hear a little crackling and you just twist the tray like a regular ice cube try and pop out. I bought different brands of trays and enjoyed them, but there were cons and more pros for this tray. The lids are nice too. They may not come out as fancy as other trays, but its food! Once frozen pop food into freezer bags! Dishwasher safe, but I normally handwash. Good luck!",5
232,"I was excited about these because I wanted to have lids covering my home-made baby food. I have never once put this product in the dish-washer, just as it states, and these trays and lids have never sealed since the first time they were in my freezer. The plastic is thick and frozen food slides out easily, but it also does from my dollar store ice cube trays. the whole point of this product in my mind, is to have the lids, and since they don't fit, I find this product over-priced and use-less.",1
233,"I purchased these trays to freeze my sons home made baby food. I used them for about 10 months total and they're still in great shape. The food never got freezer burned while in the trays and it was easy to pop the cubes out to store in bags after they were frozen. They held up great in the dishwasher also.",5
234,"I really like these trays. They are perfect for storing home made food in the freezer. You can use a normal ice cube tray, but these have a lid, so the can easily stack, not spill, and protect a little from frost bite. Now if only they were cheaper. lol.

The white plastic is flecked with black spots (I'm hoping against hope it isn't little gnats or something - that's what they look like) and two of the four lids are nearly impossible to seal.  They do the job and it is nice to be able to stack them in the freezer, they just aren't as great as I had anticipated.",4
240,"These only hold about .5 ounce each cube, so I used it for 'overflow' milk and our daycare lady could top off our son's bottles if he was cluster feeding. When he got older we used it to freeze purees and it worked great. Trays freeze well, and a quick twist releases all the cubes. The lids will warp small amounts in the dishwasher or hot water, but always went back to level when we put them in the freezer.",5
241,"I waited a full two weeks (using it everyday) before writing a review, so that I can give a hopefully balanced perspective on this. I wasn't in love with it at first. I thought, oh my god, my shoulders hurt carrying my 21 pound son. But then I remembered a salesperson at REI store (when I was looking into the Osprey and Deuter backpack carriers) telling me a trick that perhaps most people don't know - that &#34;the majority of the weight should be on the HIPS/WAIST.&#34;  Now, this is very important to remember, people -- it does make a difference when you make the belt around the waist TIGHTER (as tight as possible, if I may say).  I did that and voila, 90% of the problem is solved right there.  Once the belt around the waist is tightened, it naturally creates most (I say 'most' not 'all' because I don't want to mislead anyone here) of the weight on your WAIST, not your shoulders.  Now, I can go for walks around the neighborhood for an hour, and I feel fine.  My only comment is I wish the shoulder pads were a bit more padded for comfort - so I am looking into buying those padded memory foam car seat belt strap covers. (I will update once I get that and let you guys know how that worked out).  I love this backpack carrier so much more than the other higher-end big name brands such as Osprey/Deuter, etc -- those were GINORMOUS for my small frame and three times the price as well.  I take my son in this to zoos, museums, walks, etc.  Well worth it!!",5

244,"Ok, I am completely obsessed with these things. First of all, they smell AWESOME! Seriously, I can barely smell a poopy diaper when I put it in one of these bags. My 3.5 year old son got violently ill with salmonella bacteremia back in February, which caused absolutely horrific diarrhea, & I was tired of throwing the dirty diapers in the diaper pail because I could still smell them. So I bought these & started disposing of the diaper sacks IMMEDIATELY in the trash outside & have never looked back. I keep several of them in my truck & diaper bag, as they are also great for storing trash until you can find a bigger trash can & are even better for storing dirty/wet baby clothes when an accident occurs. The price is awesome for how many you get & I wouldn't purchase anything but these ever again!",5
245,"These have a nice light scent and work great for any smelly or messy problem. Once I've IUsed these I'll be reordering.",4
246,"These sacks work.  These can contain  Stage 2 stinky poop.  I went on vacation and did not relaise that I had left one of these in the bathroom garbage, you could not tell. Awesome.",5
247,"Living in the Pacific Northwest, the grass is almost always wet, so this is a great choice.  Keeps the moisture away and is plenty large enough for two adults plus a baby to spread out.  Washes well, no problems with stitching, easy to carry.",5
248,"Very cute!  Unfortunately it is not made to fit over most faucets.  It didn't fit any in my house.  I gave it to my sister, who had the same problem.",3
249,"Good choice. Baby can't take it off the outlet. It isn't too hard for mom to remove it to plug in the vacuum.",5
250,"I like these for several reasons.  The low price for a large supply.  The opaque color that blends with outlet color.  The quality of the plastic is sturdy but still flexible.",5
251,"My 10 month old keeps trying to pull these out of the outlets and has not yet been successful. He's been trying for about a month now. It's also nice that they are partially clear because they do not stand out.",5
252,"Works great. Does it's job. Fits into the wall just fine. Snug enough that my daughter can't pull it off herself, but not too snug that I can't pull it off when I need to use that outlet.",5
253,"They do what they are designed to do (like most other outlet plugs)... to keep babies from sticking fingers and objects in outlets.  So far so good and they have not fallen out and are not easy to take out.",5
254,"Nothing fancy or special here but they get the job done. If you have little ones and aren't trying to spend a fortune on outlet covers then look no further. They stay put and aren't a nightmare to pull out when you need to plug something in. Most importantly my kids haven't figured out how to get them out (knock on wood).",4
255,"I have two little kids and that is why I purchased these item. My kids are pretty competent in their motor skills but so far these have done a decent job preventing their access to the outlets. They stick in tight and stay there. Removal is not very difficult with the help of finger nail, but my kids have not managed removing any for the last year. A 36 pack for $2.49 is pretty cheap and that is all you need for the entire house. However due to losing a couple of them I bought another pack to have some handy reserves.The clear plastic design is also good in a way that it does not cause eyesore.The main question is 'are they durable or not ?' : I have used them for over a year and only one of them broke leaving a plastic part inside the outlet. (will need to remove it after shutting down the electricity) Other than that, no fail, no wear-tear, no loosening what so ever.I think that was a pretty decent purchase for additional safety in houses with little kids as long as you don't forget putting them back after unplugging your electrical device but as it says on the box no safety measure is a replacement of adult supervision...",5
256,"I sent these over to my son's house since he has a one year old and she is just starting to investigate.  Her mom starting putting these in the outlets and one of those outlets was on the sink.  She sits little Miss on the counter of the sink after she bathes her and now she does not have to worry about the outlet.  Well, mom had to remove the plug to dry her hair and was wondering if SHE could get it out.  It took several tries.  LOL",5
257,"You can't baby-proof without some of these.  I like that they are not super-hard for me to get out, but my son isn't dexterous enough to do it yet.  I hope he won't be for a while longer!",5
258,"I bought some outlet covers at Lowes that were the rotating kind, like this:http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Swivel-Outlet-Cover/dp/B000BQL7CI/ref=pd_sbs_ba_15?ie=UTF8&refRID;=1ZRRBYQ38MHFS52XZMM3These sliding ones are so much better! The rotating kind can get stuck in the open position (they usually do not spring back to their closed position). Additionally, they will not fit all cords - for example, an iPhone charger does not fit in the rotating kind.THESE sliding protectors are so much better because they always spring back automatically to the closed position when you're not using the outlet, and they accommodate all kinds of cords (every electrical plug will fit into these).I bought standard electrical plugs too, like these:http://www.amazon.com/Mommys-Helper-Outlet-Plugs-Pack/dp/B00081J3N6/ref=pd_cp_ba_0Personally, I recommend putting the cheap, standard kind in most of your outlets, and only splurging on these sliding covers for your frequently used outlets, unless cost is not a factor for you.",5
259,"These were easy to install easy for adults to use when needed but our twins don't try to pull the plastic plugs out on the outlets that are more exposed to them. I recommend",4
260,"As our kids became more mobile we wanted to have something to safeguard outlets which we needed to keep something plugged into.  We thought this would work great as a way to keep kids fingers and toys away if they happened to pull the plug out of the socket.In theory this &#34;works&#34; for this requirement, but in practice it mostly makes the outlet unusable.  What happens is the extra space created between the actual outlet and the plug (by having the additional plastic of this cover in between) makes most of the plugs loose and lose connection periodically.In our new house, I simply bought a bunch of new tamper resistant outlets as replacements which has worked much better and was far cheaper (~$2 / outlet).",2
261,"So easy and fast to install. Felt much safer with my 1 year old running around the tv, or me accidently bumping into it.",5
262,"I keep 2 of these in the diaper bag just in case I need them while out---as a mom of twin 18 month olds that like to run it has been a great tool for occasional use (like at disney when we were at the Playhouse Disney stage show). I do not recommend using regularly as your kids will get used to the sensation of being able to &#34;pull&#34; away from you on a leash.",4
263,"My toddler loves this seat. She's tried others--cushier foam ones, fancier moulded plastic ones--and this is the one she prefers. It's simple and lightweight, comfortable but firm enough for her. She actually puts it on the potty herself (it's easy to carry and easy to fit) and gets on and off unaided (she's 3). She likes the duckies too.",5
264,"This is a comfortable potty for my toddler son, however I just purchased one with a higher shield because it was not high enough to contain the urine in the toilet. I want my son to see the urine in the toilet and not the floor so he knows exactly where it belongs so although it is nice, it is probably better for a girl.",3
265,"We used this for our great room shelf to protect our 17 month old daughter from pulling the shelf of DVDs over. It looks a bit cheap but does the job.",4
266,"I really like the size of this diaper pail and the fact that it doesn't require special bags. However, if you are using it on a wood/smooth floor, prepare for it to slide all over as you attempt to open it with your foot. I've also found the space for your foot to be quite small. If I am wearing shoes, it's difficult to get my foot in there at all.",3
267,"These worked as advertised and I am still suing the bottles for various things even though I no longer pump.",5
268,"No good. Does not clean very well, occasionally you will have milk stains on the botttle after cleaning.I would recommend this insteadhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCSMQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B000RFCSMQ&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20",1

270,"Best bottle brush I've ever used! Cleans bottles spotless & leaves them squeaky clean! Very very satisfied with purchase! Love",5
271,"Not only does it look amazing, but it does a great job getting inside all the different sized bottles I use for feeding baby. I pump so the bottles for catching milk are narrow, but the bottles baby drinks from are wider mouthed. Works great at cleaning them both. The nipple cleaner isn't anything magical though, and I haven't really found anything that does work well other than my pinky finger with a washrag covering it.",4
272,"Most bottle brushes are too fat to get all the way into bottles. This brush is the most perfect thing ever. No more trying to pull the brush out and getting water everywhere.",5
273,"I got these for our hutch that I didn't want to have to have to put screws in and fill with holes. They were kind of on the pricey side but so far my very resourceful 2 year old has not been able to defeat them. There is a bit of a gap so that you can unlatch the childproofing and get in it yourself that your little ones will probably be able to stick their hands and arms into. We just pushed everything further back inside and haven't had anymore problems. I would get these again for things I don't want to have holes and marks in or even for super easy installation. No drilling, just adhesive.",4
274,"Some things to consider...The packaging indicates that this is a 2-pack. Two straps are required to secure each piece of furniture and there are two straps in the package, so you're really getting 1 set. A little misleading, so I thought I'd share this with my fellow Amazon shoppers.As far as the installation goes, the instructions tell you to attach one end of the strap to the wall and the other to the furniture, and then connect them. It's not necessary to line up the brackets on the wall and the furniture; the important part is that you either locate a stud or use anchor/toggle bolts if you cannot locate a stud in the vicinity of where you're positioning the furniture. (The straps don't come with anchor bolts or instructions regarding their use, but this is a commonly used option that will secure almost anything to a wall.)One of the issues many people might run into is that most furniture items these days have a bead-board or other composite type backing that will not accommodate a 1.5 inch screw. To get around this, you like need to position the brackets on the top corners of the furniture (the &#34;casing&#34;), which will likely be either solid wood or something compressed that can accommodate the screw. There are four screw holes on the bracket; instructions say you must use at least two. In order to position the bracket so that you can securely use two screws, you may have part of the bracket showing. This didn't bother me, but I thought it'd be worth a mention if you're looking for perfect. In my case, I just want to know that my sometimes rowdy son can't topple the furniture onto himself and get hurt.I'm happy with this purchase, recommend it, and am buying again.",4
275,"This is ok.  If not installed right the strap can come off.",3
276,"This is a pretty good product but man is it tough to get open! My baby isnt all that into it so I find myself not using it that often mostly to avoid spending five minutes fiddling with it.",3
277,"cons -very hard to openonce opened - very hard to close.tried multiple time to close out multiple ways (to have the triangle aligned) but it always leakstoo small to return.. i won't buy it again.",1
278,"I LOVE playtex bottles and used them for both of my sons.  When transitioning my 10 month old to sippy cups I thought these looked great and I bought them right away because I have always been happy with the Playtex bottles.  I hated these cups!  I bought the two pack, one was the sippy and one had a straw, and they both leaked.  My son got drenched the handful of times we tried using them.  The lids on both of my cups would not twist on properly.  No matter how hard I tried, and I have a few other people try as well, no one was able to get the arrows to come close to lining up let alone going past them.  I am now scared to buy another sippy cup from Playtex and am trying to decide which brand to switch to.  Very disappointed with this purchase.",1
279,"My daughter loves these sippy cups. The handle fits her little hand perfectly. The spout is easy to clean. The material is durable. We're happy with this.",5
280,"Besides the &#34;colors may vary&#34; risk I take by buying this very good deal double sippy cup pack on Amazon I love these! The price for two is almost the same as the price for one in CVS or the grocery store. I bought these cups for my kiddo when he was 7 months old and they have held up well over a year later. They are easy to clean and dishwasher safe (top rack only). The arrows show you exactly where to lineup the lid/cup to ensure a super tight spill proof lock. The handles have that rubber grippy feel which helps my kiddo hold on to the cup easily! I have found that even if my kid tips this cup upside down only a few drops will escape from the mouthpiece. I think this is a great value for my money! Highly recommend!",5
281,"These new sippy cups are TERRIBLE!  My boys have used the older version for the past 4 years.  They had a harder spout.  These new ones have a large soft spout that you can chew right threw.  The spout isn't even comfortable to sip out of.  They are horrible to use for my kids and LEAK EVERYWHERE.  I just loved the older version.  So disappointed - bring back the old sipsters!!!!!!!",1
282,"i didn't like these. for some reason they would leak if i didn't take my time and do it exactly right every time. it would &#34;click,&#34; but would still leak.oh well, bout some at target that i love and don't leak.",2
283,"Wow...where do I start?I almost never write negative reviews but I feel obligated to my fellow moms of toddlers to warn you about these cups!1. They only have 1 handle. It's hard to tell in the photo, but why would a cup only have 1 handle as opposed to a handle on either side?2. The lids are composed of 3 pieces: the nipple, the part that screws on to the cup, and the lid. The handle comes off, so that makes 4 pieces. Plus the actual cup, so that's 5 pieces! Who has time for that???3. The lids are extremely difficult to put together. So much that I wondered if they were not intended to come apart. But water gets into the little crevices so you do have to take them apart to wash them.4. They LEAK EVERYWHERE!5. They are difficult to get liquid out of for a child (my son is 1 year old and got very frustrated with how slow it flows).Save your money and buy a different cup.",1
284,"You are better off spending the extra money to buy a better sippy cup. These leak like crazy and the lids are a hassle to put together. I recommend NUK Large Learner Cup, 10 Ounce.",1
285,"I originally had purchased the ergobaby carrier and then purchased the extra infant insert. I could not figure out the infant insert - it was hard to figure out how to position our babies legs and we ended up not using it - it seemed like my baby didn't like being in that carrier.I then purchased the baby bjorn carrier and it was such a difference. It has the head/neck support built in for the early months which is great, so no extra piece to buy. The carrier itself is supper easy to use as well and wasn't hard at all to figure out.Another thing I like about this over the ergobaby carrier is that the babies legs can hang straight down vs wrapping around you. Our baby prefers his legs to be straight down and when he was younger he couldn't spread his legs far enough to use the ergo. This carrier is great to use early on and later as well.Another difference is you can face your baby out or towards you, in the ergo you could only face him towards you. That's good for early on but eventually you want your baby to face out and see what's happening around them easier.We got the mesh one so it's lightweight and breathable - I've heard people complain carriers can get so hot especially because your baby adds warmth so anything you can do to prevent too much heat is great.The only feature I miss from the ergo carrier is the storage. there were some pouches with zippers that I could put my keys or phone in if going on a walk. You can't really wear a purse so that was a nice feature. It also had a hood that came out to protect your baby from wind or sun. But they positives about this carrier far outweigh those small features I liked so I am very happy with this product.",5
286,"I have tried about 20 different sippy cups for my 2 year old. I love the fact that this one has no rubber pieces to wash! The only downside is it's a but harder to suck out of. My daughter seems to do ok with it, but she can't drink very quickly for sure. I tried it out myself. After about a month the lids are already getting some wear. Granted they get dropped and tossed around a bit.",4
287,"I'm on my third child and these are my go to. They don't leak, they're very durable. No extra parts, easy to clean. Very cute styles and best of all, I can interchange the lids. Love em.",5

289,"Soft and snuggly, but I wish we had gotten the toddler size so there would be more room to grow. The baby size is not going to last us for more than one winter.",4
290,"We got this to keep for going on picnics or sitting in the grass or sand.  It is easy to store and the blanket wipes off easily.",5
291,"Light, attractive, soft, and highly portable, this blanket has gone to most of our outdoor activities and has held up well. However, when wet, it soaks up water like a disposable diaper and transforms into a heavy, soggy, dripping mess. A waterproof PUL inner would be a great way to solve this issue. Otherwise, we love it.",4
292,"Excellent blanket, I used it to change my baby daughter's contact lens, so I if it fell off I would  see it, not the usual use I know, but now that she is older I will start using it for picnics and it is still in great shape.",5
293,"We have a spare bedroom off of our living room. When my son outgrew the changing table on his pack-n-play, I bought this to drape over the spare bedroom quilt to do changes. It works like a charm. I never have to worry about making a mess on the comforter, and I can easily pack up the blanket when we have company staying in that room.",4
294,"This is perfect for camping. I keep it in our camper and toss it out on the ground with toys for outside play. It's rugged but not rough, it cleans off easily and is heavy enough to stay down in the wind. Best part, it folds up as it's supposed to. I HATE when something like this doesn't go back into the shape or container it is supposed to go in. This folds easy and always to the correct size for the velcro to attach. GREAT purchase and definitely something I'd consider giving as a shower gift.",5
295,"This blanket is very durable, attractive, and folds neatly into a tote-sized package with carrying strap. Plus, you can sit on damp grass without getting your backside wet. I've also washed it several times in the washing machine, and it always comes out looking great. Great to keep in the back of the car for outings to the park or beach.",5
296,"This is great for moms in NYC! It allows you to be ready to picnic whenever necessary. It's waterproof, and easy to clean. I love it! It's also very easy to fold up. I keep it in my stroller at all times.",5

298,"Love these nipples because they are a great shape and size.  I love that they have slow, medium, fast instead of just slow and fast.  One note on these is I normally hand wash but decided to put them in the dishwasher once because I thought it would be good to give them that high heat sanitation.  The dishwasher turned them this awful yellowish brown color.  So I don't recommend putting them in the dishwasher.  Otherwise a great product.",5
299,"My daughter had trouble taking a bottle at around 2-3 months. We tried every single suggested bottle out there including the silicone nipples that came with the drop ins. I ordered these latex ones and she finally took the bottle! This is her preferred nipple now. After about 1-2 months they don't show any wear yet. I've heard latex needs to be replaced more frequently but I haven't noticed it yet.",5
300,"At first, we wondered why we would ever need 12 bottles, but after pumping, we saw that it was a good packaging choice by Medela. These are easy to carry out and easy to store. They're also easier to wrangle when you're first learning to bottlefeed a baby with your other arm full. These are compatible with the Medela nipple collars for the larger Medela bottles.",5
301,"How I wish my pump had come with some of these! When you first start pumping you are not going to produce very much in each pumping session. Pumping into the large 5oz bottles that came with my pump was soooo discouraging! I got only a smidgen, barely enough to cover the bottom of the bottle, and I certainly couldn't accurately measure it when it didn't get anywhere near the first markings! It absolutely caused me additional stress, which just makes pumping harder! As soon as I got these I started to feel like I could do this, that same smidgen was actually measurable, worth saving, worth the discomfort of pumping! Then from a smidgen you eventually get half a bottle! Wahoo! In the standard bottle that's not even a quarter full, but in these it's half, yes! Then comes the day when you fill it to the top, you're wondering if you can stop mid pump and put on a new bottle. What an awesome feeling!Even if you never use these to store or feed, they are absolutely worth it as a confidence builder for beginning pumping.",5
302,"Great additional stroller for tandem ride. An excellent sturdy build that fits both our newborn and our larger 4 year old. Pushes with easy and is very configurable for future use. A great product overall!",5

304,"I have been watching these on amazon for a long time and comparing tandem strollers.  I really like this stroller.  I have a 9 month old and a 5 year you.  My 5 year old is 43 lbs.  He doesn't sit in the back that much but when we are on long walks or at an event when he is walking a lot it is nice for him to have a place to sit.  He is a bit big for it but it gets the job done.  The 9 month old fits nicely in the front.  I like how upright he sits.  The stroller comes with an attachment for an infant car seat.  I attached it and my chicco car seat fit nicely.  I never went for a walk with it because my son is huge and in a regular car seat now.  I am 5'2&#34; and would like the handle to be a bit lower.  Folds up nicely, not the lightest stroller at 27 lbs.  Assembly is easy, I had to send the first one back because it had a defect, Joovy customer service was awesome and I got the new stroller within a few days.",4

307,"This is nothing against Amazon, but more so against Medela - I really wish you could have the choice of which size you get when you initially get the breastpump.  It's almost discriminatory against women with smaller or larger nipples!  I just had to order different sizes to find the right size.",4
308,"After reading the manual that came with my pump (several months after using it), I realized that the standard 24mm breast shield might be a bit large for me since a good portion of my areola was being sucked in. After receiving these and opening the package, I seriously thought they sent me the same 24mm size. But no, it said 21mm. They look pretty much the same. These have a slightly shorter shaft and very subtle smaller opening. I guess that's why it's measured in mm. After using the smaller size for a while I can't see any difference. My milk production is exactly the same and it feels exactly the same. I tried the old size again to make sure I'm not making this up. I'm sure others will have a different experience. All shapes and sizes! :)",3

These are Medela brand, came in Medela packaging, fit snugly for good suction.",5

I got this bib about a week ago, and it has worked so amazingly well! It catches everything! Literally, his clothes and booster seat are completely clean, with the exception of a crumb or two. And the best part is that you only need one per child. I just rinse it out after meals with some soapy water and boom, it's ready to be used again. Love this thing!",5

Though it works, after awhile I realized just how uncomfortable this must be for their little hips (if using for an extended period of time). I ended up buying an ergo which is the one I now use regularly. However, one perk this does have is forward facing. However, my pediatrician said this is really bad for their hips. I think I'll stick with the ergo.",3
319,"We used this for our twin newborns until about 3 months.. it worked great!Now that they are 7 months old and teething we often put one baby in this pack n play in our bedroom overnight so whichever baby wakes up in the middle of the night won't wake the other twin (normally they're in their own cribs in the same room). Upon doing this, we found it can't be very comfortable because the bottom is a bit thin and there is a bar underneath their back. The bassinets were probably much more comfortable because they didn't have this bar there. I put quilts on the bottom for the time being, but think I may cut an old mattress topper to use instead, just to be more like a mattress.Love that is it oversized- both twins had tummy time in this for a while until they started rolling (about 4 months old).A down side is that with twins, we are now looking at getting another regular size pack n play for travel because they won't both sleep in it at 7 months old.. almost wish we had 2 regular sized ones to begin with.. another down side is that the need specific sheets, which aren't cheap when you have newborns spitting up and having blowouts on them.. we just used a mattress pad (the flat ones, not the fitted kind) then put blankets under the bassinet parts.. changed the blankets when needed and it worked SO much better than a sheet would have. We changed the individual sides by doing this and avoided spending lots of money.Overall, VERY useful for the first few months - but thereafter is seems a bit big and useless unless you travel a lot.",4

321,"at first, I was so happy with this.However, someone gave me a real cloud b turtle and then I noticed that this looked like an imitation.To make things worse, I discovered another seller at a local market that sells an imitation for half the price of this one.The real cloud b turtle is of good quality.",1
322,"This is an awesome short term night light. It is so neat starting it up and looking at the stars and constellations that it projects into the bedtime night. It has become an integral part of our nighttime routine to start up the turtle.",5
323,"This is the third Cloud night light I purchased for a gift; the other two were for my grandchildren.  The lights are so soft and soothing no matter which color you choose red, blue or green.  It shines stars all over the room (ceiling & walls) depending here you put the  stuffed animal (we usually place it on the floor).  Wish I had this when my children were babies as it's really neat!  Made well and the batteries are securely placed where the children will not access them.HIGHLY recommend this for your children, grandchildren or for a gift.  An excellent gift that will be loved for years to come!  Being that this is the third one I bought, it's obvious I like the product, that's why I gave it 5 stars.",5
324,"We've been using this night light since my 3 year old was a baby. We still love it. The stars and moon are bright enough without being too bright. There's three different colors to choose from--green, blue, and orange (the green and blue are nice and bright, the orange is always very dim and hard to see). We do keep the turtle on the floor, so maybe if it was closer to the ceiling or if the room was super dark, the orange would be easier to see. The turtle stays on for 45 minutes before automatically turning off, so the batteries (3 AAA) last a long time. It's also easy for him to turn it back on--if he's still awake after the 45 minutes. We are very happy with this purchase!",5
325,"I had this on our playpen mattress as was suggested in the reviews but I find it too bulky to put the sheet on as well. Would not get again. The mattress is easy to wipe down so no need for playpens.",2
326,"Fits the crib perfectly. Nice quilting but could be improved making it a little thicker. Overall, we are happy with it.",4
327,"What the?? The existing pack and play mattress is softer than this!!! Ugh! I needed two of these for my twins who were to sleep in pack and plays while on a beach vacation. I understand that babies need to sleep on more firm surfaces but this is ridiculous. Did I get duds? I was hoping for something soft to counteract the hardness of the pack and play mattress pad. I'm sending them right back.  Instead, I folded up some towels and stuck them under the sheet.",1
328,"Exactly what I wanted and described to what I was purchasing!!! Love it. I would recommend this product to everyone.",5
329,"I wanted a mattress pad for my portable crib and this fit perfectly.  I have washed it and dried it, and it still fits fine,  with no shrinkage.  It is a basic crib mattress that fits well and has lasted through multiple wash and dry cycles.",5
330,"Nice, soft texture. Definitely thicker than the bargain version but still not what I'd call luxurious. Worth the price. And I like the shade of grey - dark enough that it doesn't look like it's just dirty white but not true charcoal.",4
331,"This thing actually fits her mattress. I've struggled for nearly 2 years trying to put the sheets on her mattress over top the mattress protector, even ripping holes in several of the corners because the sheets simply do not fit. I understand they are supposed to be snug, but good grief. This sheet is WONDERFUL. It's pretty soft, and fits with those fantastic &#34;deep pockets&#34;. No more frustrating bed linen days!",5
332,"After washing this once the fit is not great in relation to a standard mattress. It's almost like it shrunk.",2
333,"These sheets appear to be nice, quality, crisp percale sheets so as that was as expected. However, the color was much darker than the photos. The color is more of a turquoise than the light aqua image on Amazon.",4
334,"This is a pretty good sheet. It looks good, but it is a tad loose for my taste. The looseness is unattractive and makes the pattern kind of sag. It does not seem to be loose enough to cause any difficulties for baby to me though.",4
335,"My baby girl was 3 weeks early and came home at 5 lbs. It was March and FREEZING outside. All of the clothes I had ready for her were too big, including a lot of the newborn stuff :-( She was so swallowed up by stuff that I had to purchase some smaller items as I was worried all the extra fabric was going to choke/suffocate her. This swaddle was wonderful! Warm and cozy, it made her the most perfect little burrito. You can do arms in or out!!  The fleece was soft and the zipper and velcro were very good quality. The length is extra long, as with all Halo products, to give extra room for stretching out little legs. And it fit her perfectly. No more worries about a lot of extra fabric getting in her face. She outgrew them quickly Thank God but they were a lifesaver.",5
336,"They are snug, keep baby in and don't stretch over time. The plain cotton ones are a waste of money cuz they are so thin, the baby fights it's way out and they stretch out after washes. Couldn't use the cotton at all. BUY THE FLANNEL ONES LIKE THIS INSTEAD. The halo flannels are incredible and would recommend those as number one choice for swaddled.",5
337,"This was one of the many 'sacks' I tried to get my newborn sleep through the night. This one in particular is a bit too thick and too warm. Did not really like it and the baby slept in it one night. :(",3
338,"In my Jeep, which does NOT have detachable headrests in the back. Makes attaching most mirrors very difficult. This one works great.",5
339,"Great mirror! Stays put and doesn't need to be constantly adjusted. Bought another one before this one and we needed to constantly adjust it as it would move every ride.",5
340,"This works great in my husbands car, all the other ones wouldn't fit right or you couldn't see the baby. This one is very flexible and easy to install.",5
341,"I'm glad I bought this - a mirror to see my LO. I (knock on wood) haven't had any issues with it. Don't have other brands to compare it to, but it gets the job done.",3
342,"this is bigger than i thought but thats a great thing cus i can see my baby so much better than those small mirrors n i can attach it anyway i want in any car which is even better.",5
343,"I really like these blocks.  I bought them both as an eventual toy for as yet unborn child, but also to use as nursery decor in the meantime.  The design of the blocks is really great, colors are vibrant, designs are clear.  The packaging was very nice, it would make a really wonderful gift.  I really like knowing these were made in the USA and are completely non-toxic.",5
344,"We were looking for old fashioned alphabet blocks with letters and numbers on them. These are perfect. Exactly what we had hoped for.",5
345,"These are beautiful blocks: they are colorful, with interesting detail.  Each six-sided block has four letters (two of which are embossed, two of which are flat), one number, and one animal (with a picture of the animal and a description underneath the animal stating what the animal is).Our son has immensely enjoyed playing with these blocks.  He enjoys stacking them up, knocking them down, and clacking them together.  The blocks make a fantastic sound when clacked together.  We've also successfully been able to get his attention or turn his sour mood into a good mood by clacking the blocks together a few times.The fact that our son enjoys playing with these blocks is really just a bonus: in reality, we initially bought these blocks only to take ""documentary"" photos of him every month (e.g. stacking up the blocks to say ""THREE MONTHS"").  These blocks have been a cornerstone to these monthly photographs--in particular, the embossed letters really add a lot to the pictures and make everything look great.  We wanted to do something more than just writing his age on paper, but we aren't crafty enough to do some of the really cool ways people do monthly photos that you can find on Pinterest or other craft sites.  We've seen the cool pictures of the ""age blocks"" (the three blocks--one giant block that says MONTHS and sits on the bottom of two smaller blocks that have the different numbers you can rotate for the months), but those are more expensive and single-purpose, whereas these blocks have allowed our son countless hours of playtime outside of his monthly photos.We've discovered only a small downside to these blocks.  As our son is fond of gnawing on most everything, I wasn't surprised to find him gnawing on one of these blocks a few weeks ago.  However, I was surprised to find that after just 15-20 seconds of his gnawing on the block, the embossed border on the side of the block was already splintered off.  In other words, the wood is pretty soft.  I don't feel that it's fair to remove stars for this, because this product is intended for ages two and up, so just be aware of this if your child is ""orally fixated"" like ours is.  Now that we know this about these blocks, our son's chewing experience with the block was his first and last time.In sum, these are beautiful blocks that have added much joy to our son's play time and have added a lot to our monthly photos of our son.  We are really happy with our purchase of these, even if they require additional supervision.",5
346,"Received it today and put it to use right away. Purchase mainly for when we are out and about or at someone's house who doesn't have a little kid potty. My daughter is two and has being doing great potty training except that she only wants to use the small potty and only for number one. I bought her a cushioned insert for the grown up potty and she still refused to use it. I took her to friend's house yesterday who doesn't have an insert or kid potty and since she really wanted pipi in the potty she was forced to let me hold her. Guess she didn't like that or find it fun. Lol as soon as I showed her this, she wanted to use the big girl potty. She has been using it all afternoon as a matter of fact. It is designed to go all the way in the front of the seat so be mindful of that. I've reAd a lot of the reviews and it seems like people aren't using it right so hey give it a negative review. It does bend in a little but I guess it needs flexibility for comfort purposes. Doesn't seem flimsy at all. Pinching?? What pinching? Again, maybe people are misusing it. Seems pretty safe to me. No accidents yet. I really think people are using it backwards. It took me two tries to figure it out so maybe that's their problem. Only problem I have it that it is advertised as having self sealing carrying bag?  Mine didn't come with that. However , it cam in a ziplock bag so maybe they should change the wording, otherwise it is false advertising and I was very disappointed about that.",4
347,"Never used this outside the house.  Partly because when we potty trained, I was so excited to get rid of the diaper bag that I didn't want to lug this thing around.  When we tried it at home, we didn't have any major issues, but our daughter just didn't like it.  It didn't seem terribly unstable, and does have little lips to keep it generally in place as long as the kid isn't dancing around on the toilet.",2
348,"This seat is great for my 2 and 4 year olds, but it is necessary to lift them on and off of the seat.  When they try to climb on it alone, they sometimes fold in the seat.  This seat has been a lifesaver at port-a-potties!",4
349,"I had a traditional baby tub for our first baby, but we got rid of it and needed a new way to bathe our second. Now that we live in a different house with no bathroom storage, I thought this was the answer. It's not that great. It's just awkward all around. It's awkward and uncomfortable sitting it in the big tub while I hunch over trying to keep one hand on my daughter and wash her with the other hand--it's not hands-free! I KNOW you should never leave a baby in a tub, but it would be really nice to be able to take hands off her for a second to, say, push sleeves up or change positions. No can do.It's awkward for the baby too. It barely fits in our kitchen sink, so I have used it there with less back strain, but baby got too big and easily moves the whole bath seat around when she kicks. It is hard to wash all of her in this thing, as her whole tummy is completely out of the water, OR the water is so deep that it comes up to her face. There is no in-between. Also, the part that keeps baby in is the crotch thing in the middle, which is not comfortable on a baby girl (or any baby!) to have bumping her crotch every time she moves and kicks, which is basically continually.Lastly, it's awkward to store. It's really not completely small--you figure any tub MUST be big enough to accommodate a baby human, so it has to be at least as big. So it takes up relatively the same amount of room as any other tub. I have it hanging by a hook from my bathroom shelf. And it is huge, and if a male has to pee in my bathroom, his face is pretty much right in this thing. I wish I had gotten another typical baby tub. BUT it is only twelve bucks, so there's that.",3
350,"Our baby found this seat very uncomfortable and cried whenever bathed. We were also disappointed to find that it does not fit in any of our sinks.",2
351,"Good quality, my husband loves it and wants a second for another bathroom. My son uses it, and even as he gets old enough to really start potty training its holding up great.",5
352,"Comes in handy when you are on the go. Heats up quickly and warms bottle in minutes. Will purchase more.",4
353,"I used these everyday while pumping.  It's just easier then going to the work kitchen, while talking with co-workers about how hard they partied and meantime you are cleaning your pump parts.  Avoid the akwardness and get these.",5
354,"This wipes are so convenient.  They are a requirement in my pump bag for when I am at work. I use the Madela soap at home and love it too.",5
355,"I pump at work during the day and when I have to go out of the office for meetings. These wipes have been a lifesaver!  I am able to wipe down my flanges without having to leave my office and cart breastpump stuff everywhere.  I have also used these when at offsite meetings and had to pump where there was no running water. These are a must-have if you pump. Just keep a pack in your pumping bag. You never know when you might need them!",5
356,"I take these in my pump bag wherever we go.  Just remember to wipe the parts directly after pumping because it takes 10 minutes to dry before you can use the parts again.",4
357,"I use these when I have to pump somewhere without running water.  They clean well, though I haven't found a way to get the valve inside very clean, and can't clean the inside of the plastic part where the milk comes.  But they keep the parts clean thru at least 3 pumps, and I can wash with soap and water when I get home.  Glad they exist.",5
358,"The wife always has these on hand to make sure that her pumping bits are clean when on the go.",4
359,"These are great to use if you are pumping, especially if you aren't near a sink to clean pump parts.  Great to carry with you if you are pumping at work or traveling.  Con:  Pricey",4
360,"I think this jumper will work better when my child is bigger, but it is not designed for babies. The bottom/seat is too wide, so my daughter's legs were losing circulation and turning purple after a short time. The bar that gives the seat shape is well padded in the front but not the back, which makes it uncomfortable/dangerous.",2
361,"They absorb fountains of formula (I have reflux babies) and have saved many outfits and my carpet! Worked so good I bought another set!",5
362,"These bibs are fairly cheap. I got these when my daughter was in daycare and they needed zillions of bibs all the time. The price is nice for the quantity, but the quality isn't that great. They are pretty thin, and after some washings become slightly discolored.",3
363,"So my daughter has severe reflux and after trying many brands of bibs these has been the best ones. They are absorbent and my daughter throws up huge amount and I have found these bibs hold up the best.  Now on top of reflux she is drooling and it holds up. I own 80 of these bibs (read severe reflux) and I go through them in a week before having to do laundry. Speaking of laundry, I have washed them so many times and the Velcro holds up. Make sure you snap the Velcro close before putting them for a wash or dry because the Velcro is strong enough to snag other clothes and I read if you don't snap bib Velcro close before washing and drying they get ruined. So far with as much washing they have gone through (with the Velcro being closed) the absorbency and Velcro still works just as the 1st time.",5
364,"Love these and the colors are vibrant. It does keep the moisture/dampness from my baby's clothes, however, the lining at the top of the bib does get wet. I don't mind too much because it is not too much wet area to bother my little one. Washed it several times in washing machine adn dried in the dryer with velcro closed/attached. So far, velcro has not worn down.",5
365,"These are great and soak up any drool without it soaking through to the baby's clothes. They also last, so I'm sure they will be able to be used for the next couple kids too.",5
366,"These bibs are bright and colorful.  There waterproof features make them a handy way to keep a drooling baby's cloths relatively dry.  But for eating I would recommend the &#34;Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib&#34; (Ours is the Cat In The Hat design); they're easy to clean and the catch all pouch across the bottom is a mess-saver.",4
367,"All my girls have reflux and this bib catches fountains of formula without leaking or getting on any clothing! They are awesome and saved a ton of outfits and my carpet!",5
368,"These are the only bibs I have found that keep my drool monster dry! Only once has it ever leaked through and that was after dumping a full sippy of water on himself. Considering how messy this kid is I would say they hold up well!",5
369,"Love these, ordered them after I bought the Green Sprouts Waterproof Burp Cloths. They are wonderful. Perfect size for my small baby (he's only about 4 months now), but as he gets older might need a bigger burp cloth",5
370,"I bought 30 of these bibs because my child is a spitter. They are more effective than more expensive bibs. I like the velco backing. We started using them when my child was about a month old and they still fit a few months later. They hold up well in the wash.",4
371,"They're great, do exactly what a bib should do. The Velcro is strong  and the liner keeps my child dry no matter what he throws at it. If you are looking for a great baby shower gift that will actually work, buy these.",5
372,"You don't see that too often!  These are great stackers. We have a few varieties of them but these are our favorite. They are pretty sturdy.",5
373,"Nice idea, great product. I didn't really used it much since the babybjorn didn't look as stylish with it, but that is just preferrence.",5
374,"I purchased these to use with an older model of the Baby Bjorn original carrier so that it would cover some tiny stains that were left behind by the previous owner.  They did just that! Plus the price on Amazon is much less than the price any where else - plus you get 2 where every where else you get one.  Only warning - when you open them - don't be wearing black - they leave a ton of lint before you wash them.",5
375,"Once my son was big enough to sit at the table, I bought this.  We are a simple family and so the less equipment, the better.  It fits very securely to chairs - there is no wobbliness to it AT ALL. I know most people buy this and leave it in their car to take places plus they have a different permanent booster seat in their dining room.  But I wanted to hit two birds with one stone, so I bought this for full-time use in my dining room AND for travel.  Whether we go to the Grandparents' house or a friend's for dinner, we bring it.  I also packed it in our suitcase when we took an airplane to visit the other Grandparents. The booster easily unhooks underneath the chair and in the back and then folds up like a camping chair.  Cleaning: You can wipe it down with a wet dish cloth, or shake the food crumbs out of it outside, or on the dining floor then sweep it.  There is a thin, removable washable cover as well.  This is the perfect simple versatile booster we needed at home and yet also when we travel.  My son started using this when he was 2 years old and he is 3-1/2 now and it still fits just fine (He's 34 pounds).  I think he will be in it until he is at least 4 yrs old because there is plenty of room (a good 2&#34; on each side of his butt).  Also, he seems comfortable in it. :)",5
376,"We have two of these for my car with leather seats.  Our 2 year old is quite messy in the back seat and this makes cleanup so much easier!",5
377,"After trying soooo many other types of baby carriers, my son fought them all.  I snagged this cheap at the thrift store and though &#34;hey, maybe just for putzing around the house.&#34;  Nope.  The moment I dropped my son into this, he just relaxed and LOVED it.  It was very intuitive to adjust and super comfy, as long as I widen the strap on the shoulder.  It's also very light and thin, but secure, so I don't get overly hot in it.  There is a nice bit of padding where it counts, legs and shoulders, but nothing extra.  I've since gotten one (different brands) without padding and one with super thick padding.  The super padded one is more comfy, but it's also bulky, hot, and impossible to adjust easily, so I always go back to his one.The simple on/off and lovely pattern is a bonus!  I wear it to the grocery store, doc visits, and family gatherings, and I can just pop him in and out easily.  It doesn't have to be set aside, I just keep it on, and I'm not big on accessories, so that's how comfy it is.  My boy also likes to arch his back, which can make him difficult to carry, but this carrier naturally discourages the movement, and can be tightened enough to prevent it.I'm not crazy about the rings.  They are small, metal, and can dig in if I don't adjust him/it just right.  My two other slings have bigger, thicker, plastic rings.  However, I thoroughly disagree with one poster who called it a safety issue.  My 20 pound kid isn't going to snap a metal ring!This sling can also can become hard on the shoulder after about an hour, so for longer excursions, I was able (using this) to transition my boy into a mai tai.  I don't like the MT for most things, it's too hot, confining and hard to pop him in/out, but once my boy figured out how to be carried in the sling, he doesn't mind being stuffed in the mai tai for longer days.",5
378,"I had a moby and a maya before I ordered this one. The Lite-on-shoulder fit to my body better, and was light weight and easy to slide through the rings. Which made it a quick slip to put baby in and do any adjusting. It is comfortable to wear for a long time and doesn't get hot! I LOVE that the end is stitched nicely so you can literally thread it while holding your baby on your hip. There is no &#34;set up&#34; ritual. You just throw it on and go!",5
379,"I love this sling. My husband and I used a wrap carrier when our daughter was tiny, and he tends to use a structured carrier when he wears her. She's fine with that, but if I use the structure carrier she gets really cranky and cries. I think it's because she wants to nurse and she's shoved into my chest. This sling is fantastic because I can wear her on my hip or even tummy to tummy without her getting cranky. The padded rails are awesome because her little legs aren't dented too badly after wear, and the padded shoulder feels great. My daughter is still only 15 lbs, but it's incredibly comfy to wear her in this sling. I think I'll start baby-wearing more often because this sling is a great fit for us.",5
380,"Overall I am pleased with this product.  I like that the mat is easy to wipe off after use or if there is a mess.  I also like that I can just grab this and go into a bathroom and change my kid.One thing that I found is to leave the wipe container at home.  I have chosen to use the go wipes in the disposable packs instead.  I take one with about half left and place it into the mesh pockets.To use this product I take in my wipes a few diapers and a shirt.  It all rolls up into the mat without the plastic wipe container.  I did forget a shirt once and my. Baby had a blow out and we had a problem:) she just went to the car in only her diaper.Overall worth the money and very useful!  I will be giving This as a shower gift from now on!",4
381,"Very useful, convenient, and has a pretty pattern. It could use a strap of some sort to hold the entire thing shut. Velcro is not great.",4
382,"I would recommend every new mom get this.  It makes tummy time much more interesting for the baby, and I also put him on his back on the water mat, too.  So great to diversify tummy time.",5
383,"This was a bit of a pain to fill, but the real issue was that it broke after a few days.  There was a hole somewhere in the outer lining, so it didn't hold the air.  Too bad, becaue it's a cool concept.",1
384,"Pros:The nipple brush works great and it's nice that there is a suction cup on the bottom of the bottle so it can be stood up to dry.Cons:The bristles on this bottle brush are very hard so it's a huge mess when trying to scrub bottles. Soap/water gets sprayed all over when trying to remove the brush from a bottle. VERY annoying. Also since the tip is all stiff bristles I don't feel the botte gets as clean. I prefer the bottle brush that has a sponge on top - it just seems to clean better.Note:I wouldn't buy this brush again but if you choose to; I suggest you use a little dish underneath to catch all the run-off, Otherwise you'll have a little puddle on your counter each time you use it.",2
385,"This is the perfect pad for many uses and not just babies. Although I wish I had it when my kids were little since it is so multi-purpose.It is a great size, not too big, not too small. You can use it as a changing pad, a play pad or for those times that you want to take your baby's diaper off and let things air out but you don't want an accident to mark your bed or floor.There are many other uses beyond babies. If you've ever had surgery and you've had to sit on or lay a body part on one of those plastic, absorbent blue pads, you know how horrible they are at sticking to you. This is a great alternative. For those times that you may have 'leakage' during your period or seepage from anything, this is just right (although if you roll around a lot it may bunch up) but it is certainly good for a chair seat. It is great for an older person who is having trouble with leakage, especially for their furniture or vehicle seat.It washes up nicely and seems to be thick enough to hold a lot of moisture. But it is really soft as well.I was provided a sample for testing and review.",5
386,"We bed share and I needed something for those nights when the diaper might leak, spit ups, or I get a leaky boob spill because my son decides to sleep on it instead of nurse.  This works beautifully for any messes that might happen.  It is soft, comfy, and very absorbent - we had a major leak on night and you couldn't tell just by feeling the pad.  We tried some other pads and they gave my son a rash and weren't breathable or very soft at all.  Will be ordering more of these so we have backups.",5
387,"This product isn't amazing, but it's worthwhile.I struggled to find something to use on the City Mini Double.  I kept coming across reviews for this.  It doesn't fit the city mini perfectly, but it works adequately.  It's a nice addition to the stroller so that we now have drink holders and a pocket to store keys, wallet, phone, or the like.  I don't know of a better product available for the city mini double, so I would buy this product again.",4
388,"It feels kind of flimsy and it's really hard to get to be snug on the back of the driver's seat of our Honda Fit. I had to MacGyver it with some black elastic :P  None of the pockets are big enough for a book.  I'm not going to return it as I feel that it's the best of a bad lot, but someone could definitely engineer a better one and I'd buy it.",3
389,"Ever buy flannel that's so cheap it looks like an open-weave? I did -- I bought crib sheets last winter that were a joke. I should have just gone right to Swaddle Designs because we have several of their blankets.  This is high-quality, thick, durable material, and if it's pricier, it's because it's worth it.",5
390,"Getting two of those in extra tall size was the best decision we made while shopping for our two boys. One of them is installed on the top of the stairs and our 3 year old has finally met his match! It is sturdy and while we had to screw it onto the wall to make sure it stays firmly attached, it is still bravely taking on any 'attacks.' Great product and I highly recommend buying it in the extra tall size.",5
391,"This is the second diaper dude bag I have purchased. The first bag, in red, I bought for my husband a couple of years ago when we had our first child. Unfortunately for him, I liked it so much that I have appropriated it, necessitating in the purchase of a second bag for his use. I prefer to use this bag over my Kate Spade Stevie bag, which although stylish is not as efficient. This bag is hard wearing, has excellent use of space and you can get things out of it while wearing it. I even use it as my go to flight bag. And my husband is extremely happy to have his own bag again.",5
392,"The diaper bag is just the right size for a few hours out or a trip to the park. I am able to fit in Diaper essentials for my 10 month old (diapers/changing pad/wipes/2 sets of clothes/snack/formula/packaged meal) and also a snack and water for my toddler.Pros- Great size, easy to access stuff inside (which I cannot with another diaper bag that's a hobo shape)- I am able to put my wallet, keys and purse essentials easily- Bag is super light, very easy to carry with my babyCons- I read about the cell phone pouch and was excited about using it, as I seem to miss calls when I am with the kids. But the pouch is small and does not fit my iPhone 5s, A little disappointed with the design of this feature as it was one of reasons I picked this bag.",4
393,"This covers most of my baby and is easy to rinse off in the sink. I like that it ties rather than has velcro--velcro tends to irritate my baby's neck. The fabric is light and not too stiff, but still repels liquids. The elastic is a bit too tight at the wrists, however (though this does prevent food from sliding down his arms).",4
394,"the Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib , 6 months to 2 years , Blue Owl works good it is a nice bummkins for the baby",5
395,"Or just for messy eaters.  I purchased this bib for my infant as we get ready to start baby-led weaning.  I searched around all the reviews for the best bibs, and consensus seems to be around Bumkins, the Ikea bibs, and Kushies.  I ordered Bumkins and Kushies, and like Kushies the best for the following reasons:1.  Kushies has more precise sizes.  Bumkins' smallest is for 6-24 months, so is much larger than this infant size.  The Kushies infant size looks to be right for a child from 6-12 months.2.  Kushies made in Canada; Bumkins made in China3.  The Kushies material looks less plastic.  It's still plastic, of course, but it's much softer and more matte.4.  It's hard to tell for sure from the Amazon review, but it seems from another reviewer talking to the company that Bumkins is not completely lead-free.5.  Kushies has a generous, seemingly strong velcro tab at the neck.  It looks like it would be comfortable.  Bumkins has a thin tie.They both have great prints.Some people really like the Bumkins elastic wrists.  They don't seem that substantial or that stretchy to me - definitely not something that would make me purchase the Bumkins over the Kushies after seeing them both.",4
396,"got when little. growing with our baby girl. covers a lot so less worry about clothes. but all clothes will get dirty. they're babies. it's gonna happen. velcro fastener purchased approx october 2013.",5
397,"I love how it wraps around the handles of the cart (as baby loves chewing on them - gross). It is pretty hard to do one handed - as the velcro goes from one end to the other (like a 20 inch strip of velcro).  It's pretty bulky to carry with the side pillows (they look to be removable) and there are no straps for little one.  I wish I would have research this item better - I would have bought one with a harness and one that fits over the highchairs at restraunts.",3
398,"Very useful and compact. They can slide a bit though on public toilets. Wish it had hand grips for little curious hands. Does its job though.",4
399,"This dresser/changing table has been amazing!  Most of the cloths for our little girl that are the current size fit in this dresser.  I use the drawers fir cloths.  The shelves I have out baskets in.  The top shelf I fill with diapers.  The bottom has a basket full of miscellaneous baby stuff.  A changing pad, heated wipe holder, and lotions, creams and a small basket fit on the top of the dresser.After our baby outgrows the changing table she will use it as a greaser in her room.Assembly was not too hard.  I took us about two hours.",5
400,"We used a Stork Craft crib and dresser in our nursery and turned to them again for our son's &#34;big boy&#34; room. These sets are well wrapped and arrive safely, and are relatively easy to put together (maybe not quite as nice as IKEA). We definitely used screwdrivers and drills, not the included allen wrench. :) Overall it looks nice, but I'm disappointed that the finish of the various pieces doesn't match very well. (One drawer front, for example, is noticeably lighter than the others, and a few others had flaws in the finish that were clearly not due to shipping.) The drawers feel a little loose when you open and close them with one hand, as if they're not quite set on the rails well. (Obviously this could be user error when putting it together as well, but we didn't have the same problem with the other Stork Craft dresser.) Finally, the wall-mount (critical for a toddler's room) doesn't appear to be very sturdy and could potentially damage the wall. The high back and wide sides of the dresser top look great but prevent the use of after-market wall mounts that need to attach flush to a side.Still, it's a nice-looking piece of furniture and a great value.",4
401,"This was easier to use than I expected. I do think it would be best to have baby sleeping, as some reviewers suggested, but my son cooperated for the most part. The prints turned out very nice and made neat Father's Day gifts.",4
402,"Works well but is very messy.  I preferred the no mess kit over this one.  I tossed it out after one use and ordered the no mess kit.",4
403,"This was the first mat we used and liked it from the beginning. Then a friend bought us a Baby Einstein play mat. While my baby loves the blinking smiley face, it's shorter. He's only 3 months and already has the Baby Einstein toys bumping into him. That's when I realized how great this rain forest mat is because it's tall. The toys can hang from the loops to reach lower. Then they can hang from the bar when baby needs more room. The height of this gym is really better.",5
404,"I like it, although I guess I didn't get it early enough for him. So he didn't get to do much tummy time on it, but he still likes the music and the toys that hang from it. He liked the mirror so much I take it off and bring it around so he can play with it when he's playing in his car or when he's sitting in his car seat or whatever.Also, the music stops playing when baby's not playing in it, so when I'm in the kitchen working away, I know when he's moved onto something else, so I can look in to see if he's into any mischief.But I took a star off because the sound quality that started to fail maybe a month into using it. I think it's back to its normal quality now, but I feel like it might die on me soon. hopefully not, since baby still plays in it from time to time.Oh yea, now he's into grabbing onto things to pull himself onto his feet, and he would grab onto two of the four support bars to pull himself up. But they're still holding up fine and I'm happy with the quality of it, especially for the price I've paid for it.I also like that the mat is machine washable.Just a note, batteries are not included. I forgot about that and had to get them after product arrived.",4
405,"Wish I would have bought the other playmate a bought years ago...but I was trying something new. This one cost more and didn't have much to explore.",2
406,"I struggled to find a way to take care of our babies nails. I tried emory boards, chewing, clippers, others scissors, and nothing worked! When I used the clippers I accidentally nicked her skin which traumatized me more than her. But with these it is quick and painless for both of us. The short scissors make them less bulky and awkward than others and the sharpness make them extremely effective. I also love this companies nose cleaning tweezers!",5
407,"They are sharp and yet very safe. I never trimmed a baby's nail before but I can do with it with confidence. Keep in mind don't trim them too close to the fingers.",5
408,"These nail scissors are extremely sharp and work great. I use them to cut my baby's toenails as it's easier to use the scissors than a regular nail clipper. They also could work well on hands, especially if you're worried about accidentally clipping your baby's skin.",5
409,"This seems like it may be unnecessary but they truly are a great baby tool. I found that nose suckers only work when there is congestion and moisture but usually my baby just woke up with boogies. These made it much easier to keep her comfortable and clean. the tips are rounded so your little one doesn't get poked. It is also more sanitary as you can quickly wash them with soap or alcohol. good quality, good tool.",5
410,"Although my son hates these, they work well to get stuff out of his nose.  Never had a problem with them hurting him.  They broke after almost two years when I squeezed them the plastic broke.  Ordering a new one.  Just wish it had a more comfortable tip, but at least it isn't sharp.",4
411,"I wanted to like this because I'm all about my baby having a clean nose, but the rounded tips make it hard to see what I'm getting at in his nose. The rounded tips are a safety feature; I understand, but I just can't seem to work around them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Or maybe my baby's nostrils are too small; he's currently 6-months-old, but I've been trying to use this since he was a newborn. Anyway, it still sits in his little hygiene bag, but I don't use it at all. Instead, I either just use my pinky or theBaby Vac Nasal Aspirator 2012 Modelaspirator (with saline) to get those boogers out.",2
412,"great to use to clean baby's nose without worrying that it'll hurt the baby. comes with a cover so it is kept clean for the baby.",5
413,"I am using this clipper on my almost two year old daughter.  The clipper is easy to use and my daughter does not seem to mind me using it.  There are a few times where it does not clip through her nail (the nail is still attached), and sometimes I cut her skin and not the nail.  I am still looking for the perfect nail clipper, but will  keep using this one until I find one that works better for me.",3
414,"Great nail clippers. They are very sharp, which is great when trying to go fast with a fussy baby or annoyed 6 year old.",5
415,"These are terrible. My son (who, admittedly is hard on toothbrushes) chewed them up in a week. Tufts of bristles even came out! Not a good choice if your kid is toothbrush chewer.",1
416,"Stays on, easy to clean and quick to dry.  Will buy another.  Great gift as well.Fun prints to choose from.",5
417,"Love these bibs. They clean up so easily. They are great for first foods when it's pretty liquid and just slides down the front of the bib. Our baby loves to suck his food off of the bib. It's a really nice texture for babies. I always just wash it off, wring it out, and strap it onto the high chair to dry out. Works great and is always dry by the next time we need it.",5
418,"We have two of these and I need to purchase more. They are so easy to wash up and they dry quickly. They never show wear either. My only complaint is that i think the patterns for boys are pretty lame.",5
419,"I bought them after reading reviews on line so I knew what I was getting. I got them at a fair price, anywhere else those baskets where $50 and up. They are really pretty, but chunks of wood easily break if you move them too much. I bought them in white and baby blue and they are pretty similar. I bought them for the aesthetic of it really but if you plan on moving them a lot, I don't really know how long they will last.",4
420,"This is a very sturdy crib. But two things have disappointed me. The finish on the crib can be scratched off with a finger nail. My daughter, who just turned 9 months, has scratched many lines on the front rail of the crib already, and has only been in it for 2 weeks!The other thing that I am disappointed about it is that the feet flair out. This prevents the crib from being closer to the wall.",3
421,"This is my fourth mini crib from this company they work amazingly in my small daycare space for my infants! Would purchase again without hesitation.",5
422,"We bought this to use in our room to make night time nursing easier but this could easily be a full time crib until I'd say about 18 months then it might be a little small.  It's very sturdy, the finish is nice, and it arrived in excellent condition.  I did buy another mattress for it but am using the foam mattress that came with it in the bottom of the pack n play.  This is the same size as a pack n play and you can use your pack n play sheets.",5
423,"The simple design of this crib, plus the compact size of this crib was the winning factor for my purchase. The bottom of the crib is adjustable(3 settings) , so it can be pushed lower as the baby grows. It can be turned into a rocking bed by adjusting the clips on the bottom of crib legs. It is somewhat expensive, but there are not a lot of choices for a small crib out there anyway. The cheaper cribs require a Texas sized house.",4
424,"We bought this because my toddler is very curious and the locks on our sliding glass door couldn't keep her in. We installed this on the top track of the door and when it's locked she cannot get out which provides me with peace of mind. The only issue I've had is when you unlock it you have to turn it to keep it from locking itself again. My husband has locked himself out of the house several times by doing this.  Other than that this is great for the money spent.",4
425,"This thing is awesome. It fit our 7lb newborn, when other's didn't. And now he's over 12lbs and still works great. His feet get out of the pouch sometimes, but he has yet to unbind his arms.",5
426,"We have tried every swaddle out on the market and THIS is the only one that works consistently. For most babies, though, a regular swaddle blanket (or even the swaddleme) will work. But for those extra fussy/colicky babies, this is definitely the way to go. The price is steep, but a good night's sleep is worth the cost. .",5
427,"When my baby gets supper fussy and tired. I swaddle her up in the miracle blanket and within minutes she stops crying and is sleeping. It really helps against the flying arms. I'm grateful!! My baby can rest!!",5
428,"Got this swaddle for my 2 month old who breaks out of swaddles easily. This is the best swaddle and would recommend to any mom! Got our baby sleeping through the night!",5
429,"I was told about this 8 years ago from a friend with two kids. Since then, it's been a staple baby shower gift for the new moms in my lift. They all love it and didn't know to add it to their registry. THAN, we had our own child and both my husband and I loved this swaddler. Our infant was on the bigger side and was busting out of the other brands. This one kept her nice a cozy. We love it. The only thing, Miracle Blanket folks, it would be great if you could do some more with your fabrics. Something more playful.",5
430,"Worked great for our &#34;swaddle&#34; baby until he started to move around. He would get loose and start fussing... There is no Velcro to hold the flaps closed as on other types of swaddle blankets, but it was nice to have.",4
431,"This blanket is AMAZING.  I splurged and bought one when my now 2yo was weeks old, and it was a HUGE help.  He slept longer, which meant that I slept longer, and he was so happy in it.  I was hesitant to use it at first because it does swaddle them tightly, but he loved it.  I now buy it for all of my new mommy friends.  When we were using it, I actually bought two so that if he spit up or went potty on it, I had a backup.  As a single mom, buying two was a big deal for me, but it was WELL worth it.",5
432,"We have 2 of these.  They are a must.  Great color and I very much dislike the primary colored gates.  We needed to keep our young crawler and now toddler away from a gas fireplace in the winter and a console with electronics on it.  They come apart and are adjustable which is great.",5
433,"These covers are great. The Boon fits over my strangely sized bath faucet, when no others would. The flow of water is a favorite of my daughter, who calls it her waterfall. The bubble dispenser is a nice feature, although we don't bother because it's easier to just pour directly into water as needed.. otherwise my kid would let the entire supply loose in one bath. Colors are bright and pretty. I gave 4 stars because they tend to get fairly filthy after a month or two of continued use. But, I like it so much that I just clean it up as much as I can every few weeks, then finally just toss it and get a new one... the price allows me to get new ones frequently.",4
434,"Easy to use and stores are your changing table essentials! Can only about 50 diapers in the side which is so great!",5
435,"I returned these snack cups because I didn't like the lids. I bought these for my son when he was 11 months old, and I thought the plastic was a bit rough for his hands. I found another snack cup with a fabric opening that I liked better.",2
436,"I love these snack cups. When my daughter was younger, she loved trying to figure out how to get snacks out of the cup. And now that she's 20 months, it's just a good way to make sure her snack doesn't drop all over the place.",5
437,"Love it! Great for kids!",5
438,"My 13 month old son tore the top off in about 5 seconds.  I love the concept and should have spent the extra couple bucks for the one with the locking system.  Now that being said, it is perfect for my 4 year old daughter in the car.",3
439,"These are great...except my son is so smart that he removes the whole cover easily and at times he is still able to shake out and fling his fruits out of these. Overall its not a bad purchase, i will keep them for the next child.",3
440,"My daughter is 9 months and this thing scares her. It's kind of cute. I know it will be a wonderful way to dispense snacks once she gets used to it. It is durable and washes easily.",4
441,"BUT, I cannot trust my son to use this unmonitored. My son was unable to get snacks out of the nuby container, but he can use this one just fine. If he tips the snack catcher, no big deal. Being a toddler, he does enjoy vigorously shaking the container which will eventually empty the catcher of all snacks. He loves these though and we use it often.",4
442,"I bought this because I already known the brand. But also I was curious about the &#34;Hot&#34; safety button, which is really helpful when having 2 kids. They understand if they can or not touch the window in order for them not to burn then selves.The price is quite right for a product like this!",5
443,"When I first used this tub. my baby was newly home from the hospital, and was having a hard time sitting in it.  He's not almost 8 weeks old and has loved his bathes so much.  When he's inconsolable, giving him a warm bath is one of the things that helps calm him.  Since he's been around 4 weeks old, he sits better in the tub.  As he gets a bit older, he is able to sit in it much easier.",4
444,"Firstly,I have to admit that I bought these to use &#34;for the wrong reason&#34; meaning not as intended to be used. My son is day trained and we are moving on to night. I wanted something to contain as much of the accident as possible but still let him feel wetness. These work perfectly. They wouldn't hold a big giant pee accident, but I wouldn't expect them to. They wash and dry well and are comfy and not too bulky.",4
445,"Good for infant below 9 months old. Sweat banana favour and my son loves it. It's so sweet to watch him smile when he taste the toothpaste.I supposed the toothpaste is safe for consumption.For toddler, you may like to try thishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3MGU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0009F3MGU&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20",5
446,"I have been using this since my baby sprouted his first teeth. I like the toothbrush very much -- it is very soft for baby. However, if you have large fingers, it may be a bit tight. Fits nicely on my finger but my husband complains that he has to put it on his pinky finger to get it to fit.",5
447,"Started bursting my babies 2 teeth :-) with this and she likes it. Sometimes she bites on the finger brush so I think we will switch to a real toothbrush soon.but the toothpaste is great.",5
448,"Finger brush worked out great but the toothpaste was nasty. Had to buy a separate toothpaste.  Found this item only 50% useful.",3
449,"Works like a charm.  Kind of gross to install (left that up to the hubby).  Only suggestions is to install it on the side of the toilet....",4
450,"There were so easy to install, and they work great. Easy to remove and clean if they get dirty too.",5
451,"they work great if you keep them at the angle that is recommended on the packaging.  Otherwise my 16 month old was able to open the lid.",5
452,"Easy to use and install. A little loose/wobbly on my toilet, even with the size adjustments, but not in a way that makes it ineffective...yet.",4
453,"Fits well on my toilet and keeps most adults out too.It is not permanent which was a must have feature for us.My only dislike is that it is awkward when an adult has to sit on the toilet, you feel like you have a little piece of plastic sticking into your leg.",3
454,"We have used a few different brands for childproofing cabinets and drawers - this is definitely my favorite.Why its good:- Kids can't get in even after they have figured out the mechanism (it takes a fair amount of finger strength to press)- The lock open feature is great for preventing smashed fingers.  With twins even the other brands that keep them out of the cabinets do nothing to prevent accidental finger smashes.- Easy to install, better than other brands on alignment- very sturdy over timeWhats not so great:- people who visit the house always complain about how hard it is to get into anything.  I don't think it is so bad but I use them on a daily basis.- the larger tab size cuts into your usable drawer volume as it needs additional clearance to disengage the latch.  Drawer inserts, full drawers may cause additional difficulty opening.Despite the flaws, this is the best set of childproofing locks I have used out of several types and brands.",4
455,"So far, I've installed one on our knife drawer. It can be quite difficult to open the drawer, but that's kind of the point. If you open the drawer a little and get your fingers in before the lock engages, it's not too bad. Once you pull the drawer past a certain point, it won't open or close without some finagling. If you have a larger than normal counter overhang, these might be unusable because you won't be able to get your hand in to open the lock. I can't imaging dealing with these things on every drawer and door in the house, but they're definitely toddler proof, so they're a good option for the few high-security places where you keep things like knives and toxic chemicals.",3
456,"These are lightweight and great to bring along in your diaper bag as it folds up very small. It's also waterproof.  My favorite thing about it is that it has a generous Velcro strip so you can adjust to your baby's neck size.  What I find from a lot of bibs is that I can't adjust it any smaller and the food ends up on the collar.  When you put this on baby, it also covers part of the shoulder area so if he rubs his face against his shoulders, you're still covered!  It's the little things that make moms appreciate this bib!",5
457,"This was an amazing find for my granddaughter! She truly loves bright colors and I am so excited that it worked so well! Caught food and was easy to clean!",5
458,"We were gifted one of these bibs at the shower. Once our little one started solids we stopped using any other kind of bib. They keep him dry (no absorbent but will catch liquid in the pocket) and are so easy to clean, just rinse them in the sink with the rest of the dishes.",5
459,"Well conceived and well-made, these bibs are a hip at meal time.  The pouch along the bottom collects both dry and wet overflow.  Wash them under the faucet, wring and set on paper toweling to dry; couldn't be easier.  To ensure one is always at hand, we keep one in the kitchen, one in the car and the third in the diaper bag.",5
460,"Love these bibs. They're big enough as our daughter starts solid foods, and I like that the velcro closure is off to the side rather than in the back. The pocket collects bigger globs of food. They can be rinsed off in the sink or thrown in the clothes washer - easy.Great colors and designs, too. Cuter than the average bib.",5
461,"I love the pockets on these for catching food my baby drops. They're not waterproof, but are a water-resistant fabric so you can toss them in the washer and dryer without worrying about melting any plastic. They're nice and big, too.",5
462,"At home we prefer terrycloth bibs with snaps, but for travel, these are the easiest to clean (wipe off in a pinch, or rinse out in the hotel sink and it will easily dry out overnight). If these came with snaps, they'd be PERFECT (harder for a toddler to remove!), but my rating is still 5 stars! We have the Dr. Seuss and Keith Haring and love that they are gender-neutral.",5
463,"These bibs are good-quality and are certainly waterproof.  Easy to wipe off and use again if Baby doesn't get too messy.  I wish the Velcro was such that the neck hole went smaller for ages 5-12 months, but we have that problem with all bibs.  I haven't found the time to alter them.  You have to hang-dry them with the pockets flipped inside out so they are a little bit of extra work but they also work extra for you.  I ended up with 4 of these (one was bought separately) and that is probably overkill but it saves me doing more laundry.  I recommend the full upper body bibs Bumkins makes for eating out of the house.One other good point is these bibs are bigger than standard bibs so that they hang below the high chair tray past 10 months of age.  Baby girl grew out of most of her cotton bibs but these should last maybe until 2 years or more.",5
464,"these are amazing bibs! great size for 6 months. love that they are waterproof. have great coverage and are super cute! favorite bibs!",5
465,"This is good for traveling since it hardy takes up space. It drys quickly as well. However, i prefer the oxo rubber bottom, fabric up top bib for feeding table food to our toddler. The pocket stays open better compared to this bib.  Also this bib seems to retain odor so be sure to wash it with dish soap after each use.",3
466,"I tried babies r us knock offs and they were not nearly as good as the bumkins. The bumkins clean and dry easier.i just rinse after a meal and hang dry. I wash them every couple days.",5
467,"Such cute design and it big enough that it covers a good portion of the front area.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't close tight enough around the neck so that sometimes food will get on the collar area.",4
468,"arrived just as pictured and the quality we adore. these are the only bibs we buy. wash them under the sink each use and a quick towel dry and hang. we alternate between a handful and they never mold, nor smell. nice and thin to fit in diaper bag. great coverage all the way up through toddlerhood.",5
469,"First these are adorable.  Second they are extremely lightweight which is perfect in the summer. They have a side Velcro latch, not like the kind that Velcro in the back of the neck and irritate the skin. Most important, they are easily wiped clean after a messy eater.  Love them!",4
470,"Our little guy loves to make a mess when he eats and these bibs are fantastic.  They've held up well through several trips in the washer/dryer.",5
471,"My baby was not able to suck anything out of the mesh and the whole thing was too big to put or keep in her mouth.  We never used this product as anything more than a toy that our baby would occasionally hold and then toss away.",1
472,"The base of the handle is very chunky, making it hard for little hands to wrap around.  It also is VERY heavy for little hands to hold onto.  If you want to use a mesh feeder, you will end up being the one holding onto it if you choose this one.  I like the quality of the mesh part, however.",2
473,"Our little grandson loves these small, easy to grasp toys in the tub. They don't squirt all that well, but he doesn't care and loves holding and sucking on them anyway! Cute and durable, and for more than just the bath.",5
474,"My child loves these. The dolphin ended up splitting open too much to squirt water anymore but the others work fine. Bright colors and my child enjoys identifying each critter by name.",5
475,"gave this to my daughter cause she was teething like crazy (3 teeth at once poor girl.) she started using it right away.",4
476,"I used this in combination with a toddler toothbrush. This brush doesn't really do anything above a gum stimulator. Plaque is not removed, though it does remove some food particles. If the plaque isn't removed, this can lead to tooth issues later on the line. I wouldn't use it again.",3
477,"I'm slightly worried about him choking while chewing on it, though of course he will never use it unintended. But why not just make the handle larger to help allay any fears?",3
478,"I have 8 month old twins that LOVE this toothbrush. They showed signs of teething since 2 months, and have always loved to chew on them, but now that teeth are starting to come in, they appreciate them even more! I've read reviews saying that it is too big or too small.. but it seems like it is designed so that the baby can hold and chew on it while getting used to the feeling of it rubbing their teeth.. it is a good step towards transitioning to an actual toothbrush, but a bit hard for an adult to hold and use to brush their baby's teeth. Definitely recommend this product though, as my twins LOVE it.",5
479,"My son loves to brush his own teeth with this!  It is easy for him to hold and very soft.",5
480,"I truly cant imagin having a baby and not having this little guy.  Both my babies were soothed by the heartbeat sounds..",5
481,"This item would be perfect with two improvements.  First, it should have a continuous play mode.  Instead, you only have the choice of 23 minutes or 45 minutes.  Second, one must have a Philips head screwdriver in order to replace the batteries.  It would be much better if it just had a typical latched battery compartment cover.  The screw in the battery compartment cover of my sleep sheep was already stripped upon arrival.  I guess the factory was a little careless upon securing it.  With these two improvements, it would be perfect.",3
482,"This product is amazing!  The monkey noises are why we bought this item. They are funny and cute!  The white noise and water are nice also. The lullaby is a bit annoying, but I'm about to have my first child so I guess I better get used to annoying things. Lol!  It's the perfect size to hang on the side of her crib or take with in the car. I am very glad we bought this. I thought it was a waste of money at first, but it is really cute and useful!",5
483,"i got this in the mail a few days a go and my toddler loves playing with it.  i have been trying to tell her its for the new baby but she loves it and the sounds it makes.  i might have to get another one for her cause she loves taking it to bed and cuddleing it.  i really like the lamb a lot.  i like that it has eight sounds and easy to use.  i like the nature sounds and the lullbuys to it plays.  i like that it have vaulme control and it doesnt play that loud and u can set a timmer for 25min and 45 min",5
484,"I originally bought a cheaper nursing cover because I didn't want to pay ~$25-30 for a piece of cloth.  The first one that I bought was so flimsy, the fabric was really thin, the strap kept coming apart when my LO would pull on the cover, it was short, in general a waste of my money.I was going on vacation and needed one that would stay put, I bought this brand and I love it.  It is perfect.  The cover is long enough to cover all the important parts.  The top of the cover has a big enough opening that lets you look at your LO while nursing.  Fabric is good enough quality, the bottom corners have an extra piece of terry cloth to weigh the cover down so that it stays put.  Well worth the few extra bucks.  I totally recommend!",4
485,"I bought this with the intention of it being a toy for my daughter. Because every baby need to have their own rubber ducky lolI found the HOT to be a bonus. I tried using it a few times on a cup of water to see how it works. I asked my mom how was the ducky and she said it's garbage. She told me if she went by the duck my daughter would get sick because it'll make the water too cold.I tried it out myself the next night when preparing her bath water. The water wasn't even warm. I used the old method to test the water first and it felt good to me. I tried using the ducky and it says it was HOT. So, I thought maybe I'm wrong. And lowered the temperature of the water until the HOT went away. The water was cold. It wasn't cold as in ice cold. It was cold like, room temperature.Munchkin has never made anything that works great or as good as it promises for me ever.So, this just sticks to as being a toy for my daughter.BTW it doesn't quack/squeek either because there's no hole for it to happen :(",3
486,"This is cute to have in the tub and my baby likes to bat /kick at it but definitely wouldn't use it as a temperature sensor.  Useless for that.  I just got it for her so she would have something to play with and associate with bath time.",4
487,"It does light up when we run it under very hot water, but otherwise, it always sort of always looks like it's half lit up.  It's good enough for a rubber ducky toy, but I wouldn't recommend trusting it to tell you whether the water was too hot for your baby.",3
488,"This duck is fun, it floats, and it tells you when the bath is too hot. Perfect for my husband when he bathes our little one, because he never got the temp right before. Now this little ducky will tell him when it's too hot! Yay! No more worried mommy!",5
489,"i hope my baby will like it,this toy looks very nice,i hope my  baby like it when i make bath to him",5
490,"My 16 month old loves this toy. And I can see it growing with her for a while since the neighbor kids (8 and 10) love it too. High quality and the small size was fine for my taller than average child.",5
491,"I didn't have one of these for my first baby and wished I had! My 2nd baby loves his bumbo. He's been using it since he was 4 months old. I can see where other reviewers were saying their baby's legs didn't fit. If your baby's legs are chunksters then no this seat wouldn't be very comfortable for them. Got this for a great deal so I'm even more pleased about it.",5
492,"My twins were too big for this once they were able to use it- we returned it. I've seen it work for some infants, just not ours.",2
493,"My son has consistently been in the 80-90th percentile for weight, and we were only able to use the bumbo for maybe a month. When he was small enough for it, he didn't have good enough head control. Once he developed the head control, he was too chubby for the bumbo! We squeezed him in it for a few weeks, but it quickly got to the point where I didn't feel comfortable with how tight his bottom was in the seat. We literally had to pry him out of the seat, because when we went to pick him up the seat came with him. For us, the bumbo was not worth the money.",3
494,"My mom bought this for me when my daughter started liking sitting up. I couldn't hold her up as much as she wanted to sit up so we thought this would be a great idea. I wanted one without the seatbelt because it just gets in the way. I NEVER use the belt. The seatbelt is pointless and my daughter always sit on the buckle part. There is no way to get it out of the way. My daught is kind of a chunk and I can see that in a few more months she will not be able to sit in this any longer due to small leg holes. It's a good product but not the best.",4
495,"This is a great set at a descent price. I like that the top sheet has fittes ends. That makes it so much easier. The pillow case is perfect because it can be used for a toddler pillow of an asult pillow. Loved the material",5
496,"I needed something for my son whom we have moved to a twin bed.  It is up against the wall, so we only needed a one sided bar. I read about the 3 main kinds--ones that stay in place, ones that swing down during the day (hanging down), and this kind, that slides away out of sight.  I had planned on getting the one that stayed in place.  Our bed is low to the ground, so any of the ones that just hung down would QUICKLY be turned into a toy/slide/something to jump on by my son, I am sure. I had read that this one &#34;tears up the mattress&#34; so had ruled it out.  I was going to order the one that just stays up, and hope my son not break it.  But, right before I ordered I read a few more reviews including one that said you have to remove it each time you change the sheets/make the bed.  No way.  So I went with this one--deciding tearing up my mattress was no big deal.It was VERY easy to put together.  If I was going anywhere for an extended time, I would absolutely take it with us.  When I got the instructions, they point out that &#34;lower quality&#34; box spring mattresses may rip.  I decided if the box spring rips, I don't really care.It is very easy to put down and up everyday. I love that it is out of site and not easy enough that my son can pull it out.  I'll update in a while if it does rip my mattress, but with how great it is working out--i won't care.",5
497,"My son has chewed through our crib.  I should have purchased this long ago, but didn't know there was a fabric alternative to those awful plastic rail covers.  This one is fantastic and safe to gnaw on :).  I love it and could have saved the crib had I bought it sooner!",5
498,"We bought this as a child safety device and as added home security. Our intent was to keep our toddler son from running out the front door into the street.Pros:- easy to install with a drill- magnetic feature makes it more secure- can install at top of door, out of reach of child- not uglyCons:- magnetic part can make it difficult to unlock- sometimes it seems locked but it's not",3
499,"My 10 mo old son loves it. We probably should have gotten it when he was much younger but he picked it up in a dr office and wouldn't out it down so we couldn't resist. He loves that you can make noise with it.",5
500,"These blocks are super cute, but are not stuffed at all, so the minute your baby squeezes them or sits on them or anything like that, they just flatten out. They are not fun to play with at all because of this.",1
501,"This is a good bath sponge. It fits in our square kitchen sink and makes it much more comfortable (seemingly) for infant bathing. Also saves me from having to support the baby's head and neck for the entire bath. Easy to wring out and dries quickly. I do wish it came with a storage bag to help keep it clean when not in use.",4
502,"Perfect!  Exactly what I was hoping for!  I put my little Grandson on this in my kitchen sink for a bath and he was comfortable and happy; no slipping around.  When he was smaller he leaned back on it and splashed a little and enjoyed the water.  Now he's a little older (7 months) so he sits up on it and plays with toys.  It's perfect; so easier than a slippery tub/sink, and so much easier that trying to sit on a towel, etc.  I also lay it down dry on my kitchen counter, or anyplace, covered with a towel, and use it for a changing table.",5
503,"I received a &#34;bath lounger&#34; as a baby shower gift and thought it was just the cutest little thing - looked like a beach chair for bathing the baby! I had barely laid him on it when he nearly slipped right off. My mother in law told me about the &#34;bath sponge&#34; and I while I stared at her like she had 2 heads, I looked it up, and I'm glad I did. This thing was so perfect while my son was little:Pros: lays flat in the sink/tub; you can let the water warm up while running over it, and since it's a sponge it holds the heat/water so it's comfortable for your little one; wrings dry quickly and easily; CHEAPCons: None. We used this thing for 6 months with no issues.",5
504,"I own the Uppababy Vista stroller and saw that the reviews for the Uppababy cup holder were mediocre.  I decided to order the Valco Universal Cup Holder as it was cheaper and had better reviews.  This cup holder is durable and has an adjustable enclosure loop that allows it to attach to a variety of strollers.  While it did fit on the Uppababy fine, it was a hassle to put it on and take it off (not difficult or too incredibly time consuming, just one more step when trying to get out the door with baby).  If I had a drink with an open lip (like a take out coffee cup) it ended up spilling out the top and dripping down the sides if we went over any bumps at all (sidewalk, door jams, etc).  I ended up ordering a universal stroller organizer with cup holder(s) that fits my needs better.",3
505,"This works really well. We can fit anything from a bottle of water to a 32 oz fountain drink if we so choose. The inserts in the bottom help hold smaller items in place and the top arms help hold anything light from tipping over.With how our stroller folds up, we needed this to be mounted in a very specific location. The mounting works great and we were able to position it exactly how we needed it.",5
506,"Exactly what I was looking for.  I haven't had the problems of the brush falling apart and we have used for almost 7 months.  Works great!",5
507,"This are soft and full and help support my son's head.  They also are big enough to help hold his WannuNub Monkey passifier.  We ended up buying two pair.",5
508,"Turtle was very cute and super soft. Rattle is also a nice quite sound unlike some of the rattles out there.",5
509,"I've been using this for several months and I love it. I don't use the pockets but they wouldn't hold much. I've also put this through the washing machine and it came out just fine. Perfect knee saver!",5
510,"This is very nice, as it protects your knees and keeps everything you need where you can get to it. (and away from the baby)",5
511,"Purchased this for my brother's family. I've given their baby baths, and this mat is nice! I like that it folds up to be out of the way when not in use, and the pockets are handy. The padding is definitely better than just the bath mat.",4
512,"This thermometer is cute, and a great idea to have for bath time...but ours quit working after 2 uses. And the times that it did work in kind of questioned its reliability. Perhaps we got a lemon but might be worth looking into something else from our experience.",2
513,"I like to take very hot baths and showers so I didn't think I'd be a good judge of what's too hot or cold for a baby, which is why I bought this. It's very cute and does it's job. My baby also likes to kick at it in the tub.",5
514,"My son loves to play with this in the bath. It is bigger than I expected but works very well and was worth the money.",5
515,"used only a couple of times.  after i got the hang of the temperature that was needed, no longer used this.",3
516,"I bought this to go with the set of Dr Brown's Bottle set I bought my daughter for her baby shower. She didn't like how complicated the system was to clean the bottles and ended up using another brand of bottles.",2
517,"If you use dr. Browns bottles this is a must. I got 2 and have been using them for 11 months now. Really good product. Dries bottles and components fast",5
518,"I put a new floor lamp in the living room and my 2 year old kept trying to unplug it then plug it back in. She has completely forgotten about it since the first day I put this on. She was mad at first but got over it very quickly and moved on. SO happy I bought this!",5
519,"This is basically a big piece of velcro so it will show the wear and tare pretty soon but it does the job.  Everything stays in place and is nice to have my hands free and not be focusing on how time consuming pumping is because I can busy myself in other tasks.  The halter strap is not necessary to me and I don't even use it.  I like that it's one size fits all and you can adjust to whatever you need.  The price is nice too.",4
520,"I took this on a camping trip where I wouldn't have access to power, and it lasted through three 30-min pumping sessions with no sign of slowing. Giving 4 stars because it requires 8 AA batteries. I used rechargeable AA's and it still worked fine, but this can get expensive. I wish Medela would make a battery pack that was actually a chargeable power pack.",4
521,"I was willing to buy one of these My Brest Friend Pillows for a while until I saw this one in discount. It came really well package by the manufacturers with a clear plastic special designed case that makes you able to carry it whenever you want to go  without make it dirty.",5
522,"Despite all the glowing reviews for this nursing pillow, I hated it. First the clasp was NOT silent release. It sounded just like every other plastic buckle easily let out. But my baby has a huge startle reflex and the moment I gently released that buckle, boom, she was freaked out and awake. Plus the &#34;head rest&#34; bumps or whatever on the top of the pillow did not correlate well with me or my baby's needed positioning. And yes, I know what I'm doing. The back rest part I was very much looking forward too, but it was terribly uncomfortable and way too stiff of a surface. I don't have a recommendation for a pillow to get instead of this one unfortunately. I don't like the leachco I got either (for the exact opposite reasons...not stiff enough!). Perhaps it's time to try a Boppy.",1
523,"I got this for WAY cheaper than in the brick-and-mortar store where I registered, so I had to scoop it up. I already had a Boppy, but I had read great things about the. My Breast Friend too.Ultimately, breastfeeding didn't last for us (tried with no luck for several months and then switched to exclusively pumping for a year). I did use it many times while I tried nursing and I did like it in general. I like that you could strap it on, so it wouldn't really move. It was also a bit more firm and flat than the Boppy and that did seem to work better for us when nursing &#34;almost&#34; worked.I did also like the pocket, which was nice to keep small items in like my nipple shield and case so it as close at hand.The only thing I wasn't a fan of was how cumbersome it was when I did have to sit down, but the baby down in the bassinet or swing, strap on the pillow, then try and nurse. It just took a while, which was annoying when breastfeeding was already frustrating.I'm hoping to get much more use out if and when we have baby #2! :)",3
524,"I originally got the Boppy for a shower gift and used that as a pillow for helping me breast feed my first.  After a month he got bigger and it was not so comfortable to use it.  Someone recommended that I try out this pillow...what a difference! It is awesome that is has a belt closure, the pillow is stiffer which is great for baby positioning, and it is way more comfortable for me to use.",5
525,"this is the best nursing pillow. i've tried all of them and have a boppy too but this one is better. the buckle holds everythig in place and he doesn't move all over the place like with the boppy. it has a convenient pocket for spit rags and whatnot. the deluxe has the buckle so the belt stays in the same spot every time and you don't have to velcro and make noise each time. it's a good deal and comes with the pillow cover unlike the boppy. it's not perfect, i still have to put a pillow underneath to get to the right height but no other pillow out there is that high. i definitely reccommend.",5
526,"This pillow is by far the worst that my wife has tried.  I even tried it out and think it is too firm, uncomfortable, and over complicated.  &#34;1# Choice of Lactation Consultants and Moms Worldwide&#34;?  I'd like to know what select sample group they use to fabricate that claim.  We had used a Boppy with our prior single and it worked great but I can see how it can get a bit small.  We thought this would work great for our twins but quickly found that it was a poor purchase decision.  Trust me you are not going to travel well with this huge monstrosity that will not pack down into a normal person bag or luggage. This made in china pillow is not for us.*We replaced it with a Luna Lullaby Bosom Baby pillow which my wife likes much better......and was highly recommended by our lactation consultant.  It's more like a pillow so it does the job and travels well.  No dumb noisy velcro.  It's made in the US and I would use it for a regular pillow too.",1
527,"With my first son i went cheap and used my bed room pillows as support- yeah bad choice. Second time around I insisted I get a nursing pillow because in addition to feeding a newborn I have a toddler to take care of. Now I'm only a week in but I think this thing is awesome. I may look like an idiot walking around my house with a foam pillow attached to my torso and a baby hanging off of me- but it leaves me and most times one hand to deal with my toddler. Breast Friends for Life. Seriously.",5
528,"This had a horrible plastic smell when it arrived so we aired it outside for days before giving it to baby. Then after two weeks the music stopped. Wouldn't buy again.",2
529,"So cute & colorful. I like it! Hopefully my daughter will play it soon. I can't wait to see it. Funny they are same lenght!!!",4
530,"My son loves this toy! We put it in front of him when he does tummy time and he will just stare and stare. It's so colorful and all the wings crinkle when he grabs them.",5
531,"I heard great things about these. But my baby is not a big fan of these. I bought the firefly too. Sigh. Maybe he will like them later?! He is 5 month old.",3
532,"We bought this when our daughter was a newborn and now she is 4 months old.  She loves it.  It keeps her entertained in the car, at home, and in her crib.  What is great about this product is that you can clip it anywhere you go.  There are two sides to this toy and she absolutely loves both sides and the sound.  She never gets tired of it.  For the price, this is a baby's must have.",5
533,"My son has been in children's hospital for some time now and he loves to just stare n kick this thing I think it's the colors of it everything about it he smiles. I would recommend this to every Infant.babys love it.if I had the money I would donate these to children's hospitals for sick baby's.because I believe it would cheer them up.",5
534,"This toy is awesome and will surely be enjoyed by our daughter for years to come (will appeal to infants and toddlers alike).Some key features:- Lower left orange ball is a squeaker- Lower right layered &#34;feathers&#34; all different textures, including crinkly- upper right has a mirror- upper left has a rattle-like elementVery cute toy, we like to attach it to baby's car seat and stroller to keep her entertained.",5
535,"This little toy is babies new favorite. Two legs crackle and two have chime. The best one is the belly, that just makes baby laugh!Two month old spends time trying to grab the feet, a joy to watch!The only downer is that the Fur can get difficult to clean and dry!",5
536,"These are so cute, but my baby's arms were too big by the time I got these.  Love the idea, will definitely save for second child.",4
537,"I thought these were cute and playful for my child who loved playing with his feet. After about a week, I noticed a string hanging from his mouth and when I pulled it out, it was an antenna from one of the bugs. Considering EVERYTHING goes into a child's mouth, I don't feel these are safe if your child chews on things. I understand not everything is made for chewing, but child's toys should be.",1
538,"Amused our not-happy-in-the-car baby for a solid 20 minutes because the feet are sort of at eye level when they're in a car seat - make just enough noise to be interesting, not too much so it's overpowering to the parents. Adorable.",5
539,"I hooked it to her car seat and she grins as soon as she sees it. She plays with every part of it, from the ribbon cord knotted feet to the crinkly wings. She is only 3 months old now, I am hoping when she gets more dextrous she will even use the little teether.",5
540,"This toy offers a great way for infants to explore different colors, sounds, and textures. Its kind of like a gold mine of interesting things for the baby! It is much larger than I had anticipated as well which makes it even more worth the price. I can't think of anything that would make this product better. My 4 month old loves gazing at him and touching all the soft materials on him.",5
541,"4 month old loves this toy, very colorful and lots of fun. If your looking for a great toy this is it",5
542,"Hands down our child's favorite toy, and has been since he was three months old. There are so many textures and details to hold his interest. Four stars only because it's not machine washable - would be the icing on the cake.",4
543,"my son loves this toy it does everything...makes noise, chewable parts, easy to hold, bright colors, black and white back wings to help baby track.  I should buy another one!",5
544,"my daughter is almost five months old and loves this toy.  I give it to her to play with during commute to daycare and work.  She loves to hold the rings at the ends and move the toy to her mouth to gum it.  I was worried this toy would not be used because my first daughter was more visual.  Luckily my second daughter loves to use her hands to explore, touch, etc.",5
545,"Just bought this about 3 weeks ago, and this has been my three month old daughter's favorite toy.... she LOVES this thing!  He is just long enough to dangle from things so that she can grasp onto him.  Freddie also is very colorful and he makes the crinkly sound when she kicks or bats at him.  I would definitely suggest this toy!  My sister is about to purchase this for her 5 month old.",5
546,"Baby loves reaching for this toy. Helps teach them to grab and hold items. Great for dexterity. The bright colors catch their attention.",5
547,"This firefly is great. It has crinkly wings, a squeaker, several different textures, a teether, a mirror, and rattle. My 6 month old loves it. The only drawback is that it is surface wash only. I would love to be able to throw it in the washing machine to clean it.",4
548,"Baby's love toys like this from the front to back it's something to just stare at for baby's good coordination.",5
549,"I have &#34;newer&#34; version (the one with no water). I think this is the version that has been out now for sometimes (and part of the reason I wish Amazon would create new entries for new versions of baby items since they seem to always be changing and can't rely on older reviews).  Anyway...my 10month old baby loves this toy and has now for the past 3+ months. She plays with it almost every morning while getting ready for the day, and every morning, she has just as much fun as the morning before.  The toy is great in that it is quiet - ie not electronic and no batteries needed. The animals are just the right size for her hands to grab out of the bowl.  For some reason, she has become especially attached to the starfish. Unfortunately, we lost it somewhere and thus, had to buy another fish bowl toy (since you can't purchase just a single animal). We kept the starfish but gave the rest of the duplicate to her daycare classroom - the kids there immediately circled around the toy and all started playing with it too (ages 6 months - 14 months)",5
550,"We had this swing for our first son but it was borrowed.  When we had our second, it was a MUST to get a plug-in swing.  This swing works perfect in our living room and isn't too big either.  I also like the adjustable recline for the littlest babes.",5
551,"Our son will only sleep at night in his swing.  Ours was 5 years old and finally broke down.  We looked around for the best deal that also would plug into the wall.  We found this and it works great.  We've been using it for a few months now and really like it. It's super cute and very gender neutral.",5
552,"This placemat is okay. It's very thin, and don't scrub too hard or you will remove food as well as the picture! It is what it is, for the price. I can't understand why placemats cost so much anyway, and even though this one isn't great- I'd probably go with it again anyway, because all I want is to protect my table and it does that.",3
553,"I like that it's cute without having a gender preference.  My daughter likes her potty duck. It's inexpensive, already has a nice wall hanging component (though we use a door hook and hand it from the toilet).  I don't like that the eyes are stickers, as she peeled these off and I've had to redraw them with permanant marker.  The rest of it is easy to clean.  She climbs up into it herself without difficulty.",5
554,"I really wanted to love these caps and they are good for storing premade formula without wasting a nipple and cap.  However, I found that the caps can leak if the bottles get tipped over in a diaper bag or the like.  I imagine you could screw them tight enough to prevent this, but at that point I would have trouble getting the cap back off.  I would have given this 5 stars if it had a washer in the cap to prevent leaks but I imagine they would have cost more. That being said, they are wonderful for storage in your fridge or other place where you know they won't tip over.",4
555,"My born free glass bottles don't have caps. These Dr. Brown caps fit perfectly! Now I can use my BF glass bottles to store breastmilk in the fridge without worrying being contaminated by the smell of other food",5
556,"This giraffe is cute and our baby has seemed to enjoy gnawing on her but the $20 price tag for such a small toy is kind of surprising. I think I was expecting something  a little larger. The natural paint and rubber is a healthy choice and I appreciate that, and is why I bought it. Also be careful when you wash it that you don't get water in the squeaker, I made this mistake and it took a while for it to dry out and for the squeaker to work again. I know this is a quality toy that I can let my little one play with without worrying and I guess that is worth the price but...",4
557,"When we originally purchased this toy, I wasn't sure why I was paying $20 for something that was going to be chewed on. Now I get it. My daughter loves this toy. It's pretty much her favorite thing to play with, and it's especially nice because she is teething so horribly.",5
558,"This is one of my go to presents for new babies. I have bought over 6 of them and every baby has loved them. It is soft and great for teething.",5
559,"I have read a lot of these reviews that say they got a fake, or their baby has choked on this. I can see where a baby can easily gag on this toy but for me that is not much of a concern. I don't generally give my daughter toys to chew on when she's on her belly and she gags on her own fingers/hands more than anything. As far as this being a counterfeit product....the Sophie I received was the real deal. My 4 month old daughter is just working on being able to chew on this herself but seems to love it!",5
560,"Over rated!  Much better chew toys out there.  This is an overpriced dog toy.  It's not even that great for teething.  Don't waste your money.",3
561,"I have received this as a gift from a good friend of mine who has 2 children now and who is always on top of market trends for children'stuff. I was initially surprised about the vintage look of the toy and the old fashioned style of the material. It looked just a simple piece of rubber to me but I thought that my friend should know better about baby toys...Just out of curiosity I've researched into Amazon and once again I was amazed to find 3000...reviews on this toy. I have paid special attention to the reviews that commented on the dangerous side of Sophie. After that I would just say&#62; I would not buy this toy if I had the chance since the comments on chocking situations are enough for me to avoid it and like another reviewer said, why take the chance?...On the other hand the excesive amount of reviews made me understand that the popularity of this toy is just a matter of fashion, &#34;the thing of the moment&#34; since sincerely there's nothing outstanding about Sophie to make such a fuzz about it. Bottom line...I wont let my baby play with it.",2
562,"Bought this when my son was about 8 months, now at 21 months he plays with every once in a while. He likes to hit it with things to make it squeak but that's about it. It did have a strong rubber smell and still does. Also if you make the same mistake as me and wash it and get water in it, try putting it in your car on a hot day so water evaporates ;)",3
563,"I know everyone raves about this teether, and for some reason, kids seem to love it.  But I have one big gripe - the legs.My son chews on this thing, and he ends of gagging himself b/c he shoves the legs so far into his mouth.  I stopped giving it to him for that reason.",3
564,"I have seen this ridiculous giraffe suggested as a teether since before my first child was born.  I could never get over its price tag to purchase it. My second child is now here and he's the curious type. He likes to grip and study whatever you place in his hands, really focusing on the toy, but he still has trouble actually hanging on to things for very long. Since he's now working on his first set of teeth I finally caved and bought this thing, figuring that with all the different gripping options he'd really love the thing. And I was right! Not only that, but my oldest thought the squeaker inside was the greatest thing ever. They both took turns playing with Sophie, the oldest squeaking, and the youngest gnawing away. It was easy for the kids to hold on to, and I liked that it gave the little one another option for chewing besides his fingers or a pacifier. I also like that it will be easy for me to clean since the surface is a smooth rubber. The only issue I foresee is being forced to purchase a second one because the kids both want to play with it at the same time. We all loved this from the second we pulled Sophie out of the box.",5
565,"My baby loves this toy.I give this toy as a baby gift to anyone I know doesn't have it. I have yet to come across a baby who owns this toy that doesn't love it. It has such a nice texture and such a nice little squeaker in it. My little one loves to chew on her ears and legs. It seems to appeal to him that just the lightest grip will make a nice light squeak as well. Perfect shape for little hands to grip.Great product.",5
566,"My daughter didn't love it, but didn't hate it.  She chewed on it and it was easy to clean which was nice.  I read some reviews a few months after I purchased and didn't realize how scary it can potentially be if she were to roll on it and get a foot stuck in her throat.  Thankfully nothing to that extent ever happened with my daughter. I did tie a piece of yarn around it's neck and tied the opposite end to her stroller to prevent it from falling which was nice.",3
567,"My nephews and my four kids all had Sophie in the 70's and 80's, and Sophie hasn't changed: she is still the perfect teething toy!  She is the perfect size, the perfect weight, the perfect material.  Babies can grip her easily, hang on easily, and chew on multiple places.  She's great in the bath too but her squeeker gets water-logged for awhile.  She's perfect; a timeless toy!",5
568,"My little one does not care for Sophie at 3 months old. He won't squeeze or play with her and he doesn't like the rubbery texture. Everyone I know loves it though, just not for us.",2
569,"I have used a LOT of wet bags, as we have only cloth diapered, and never used a disposable diaper.  These are the very best.  They come in two sizes (I actually prefer the larger size, these days), are super easy to throw in the diaper bag, can squish to fit any corner, and contain the stink.  They wash up well, and only after about three years of nearly daily washing, have I needed to order more.  They give you the most bang for your buck, come in great colors, and are my very favorite wet bag.",5
570,"great quality but I think it runs a little small.  my son is only going to be able to wear it for 2 months.  if you buy it definitely buy a size bigger. in the water it  molds to the child so it's great.",3
571,"My son is 6 months old and is big for his age so I ordered 12 month to fit him.  This thing is super tiny and is for a newborn.  I would need to order him 24 months or larger to fit him.",2
572,"i got this for my daughter and its exactly what i wanted. i wish it had a matching top. so cute",5
573,"PROS- FIT:  3T was a perfect match for my 2 year and 11 month old toddler.  My son is in the 70% for height and weight.- PULL UP STYLE: Many reusable swim diapers have snaps on the side.  This one is a pure pull up style which is awesome for my toddler who is already potty trained.  This is very convenient since my son doesn't like to stop playing for potty breaks.  This pull up style cuts our bathroom time in half.- SHIPPING:  Arrived at my door in 5 daysCONS- Sexy sheen:  That look might be cute on a stripper, but, not so cute on a toddler.  Although this sheen is preventing me from buying this swim diaper again, I am only taking one star off sine the sheen since the sheen is depicted in the picture. I just wish they would have name the color &#34;shimmering royal blue&#34; instead of just &#34;royal blue.&#34;  We will only be using this swim diaper at home when we do not have any guests in the house.",4
574,"This thing has come in handy so much with our baby. Recently it has started kicking off after just a few minutes. I've changed the batteries and that doesn't seem to have helped anything. Before that my only complaint would be that it kicked off after 45 minutes and she would wake up but due to the amount of construction going on around our house she has now learned to sleep through anything. We still use this at night and during naps to soothe her but when it kicks off (after the full 45 minutes) it doesn't mean she wakes up instantly.",3
575,"Is too small, its not the same as the normal ones, i dont know if its original but its too small and can not be put in the crib because is too small.",1
576,"Helps baby sleep by providing soothing &#34;white noise&#34;. The ocean sound provides a swooshing noise that not only sounds like waves on the shore but also mimics the sounds they hear in utero. Perfectly soothing. Like others I wish it had a setting where it could just be on instead of switching off after 45 min. As baby wakes up. I just use it as an opportunity to nurse her to sleep for another 5 min and reset sheep. Anyhoo, it really is an almost perfect gadget.",5
577,"I tried to use the cheaper knock offs but they didn't stay in place and i gave up.  Then I received the actual Mommy Hook in a subscription box and I love it!  Wish I had just bought this one in the first place.  It stays where you place it on the stroller and doesn't slide based on the weight of the bags.  Obviously you can't load too much or the stroller will tip but the hook itself can hold quite a bit.",5
578,"This hook is perfect for carrying my diaper bag, key rings, baby toys that have a loop, or even a really heavy grocery basket. Note: please make sure there is enough weight distributed on the other end of the stroller as you add items as not to flip baby out!!!The grip is soft and the clamp is easy to open and close but is not loose where it is easily opened. I love the green, it is my favorite color and matches the other green I have going on in my stroller and diaper bag (really just a personal preference).Overall, very functional and handy thing to have! Not heavy or bulky to keep attached all the time.",5
579,"A piece of the metal broke off that kept the spring latch closed when I tried getting it off of a thicker stroller handle. I like this product for regular strollers, but just be aware that it moves around freely. Other hooks have Velcro straps to prevent movement, so whichever you like better. I personally use both now.",3
580,"Our daughter bought this chair for her home when she was pregnant.  We watch our grandson several days a week and I needed a chair to put in our guest room that I could use when he is here and also that I could use just when I wanted time for myself to relax.  It is wonderful.  I would buy this item again.  Received in good condition and on time.",5
581,"This is a simple strap that allows you to attach any LATCH compatible car seats to your luggage. As some other reviewers mentioned, this can probably be achieved with a metal ring if your straps are long enough to reach around your suitcase. This wasn't the case for my Britax Marathon so I forked out the money for this product. With that said, I was able to attach my car seat successfully to both a larger suitcase and a carry-on size that I own. I also like to mention that I highly recommend not putting a child in the car seat while it's attached to your luggage. Luggages were not designed for this purpose and you will likely damage it if you use it in that way. This product allows you to carry your car seat along with your luggage but does not turn your luggage into a stroller.",3
582,"A lot more labor intensive to hook up than the competitors, but overall gets the job done. Wish I would have spent the extra dollar or two and got the one that was easier to work as traveling with littles is already a challenge!",3
583,"A great addition to the new stroller, allowing even more easy storage options for water bottles, wallets, car keys, etc. The thing you want handy and not in a diaper bag under the kids.",5
584,"After looking at all the Fisher Price potty chairs and showing the pictures to our 2 yr. old daughter this is the one she wanted. It's a pink Princess chair well built and simple to use. She sits on this potty and proudly goes pee, after she's done the cup inside can be dumped into the toilet, inside washed off and back in the chair ready for more. Very easy for adults to put on seat should your little one take it off, When the waste hits the the cup, music plays, so she knows she's doing it right. Sturdy enough to use as step stool to reach the sink to wash her hands.Attractive for little princesses  and makes her a big girl. Made by Fisher-Price and easy for children and adults, she' a big girl now, no diapers, hurray.",5
585,"My baby seems to like playing with them. Suction was good for the first day. Now, 1 lid only? Seriously? I was digging in the garbage thinking is not possible, I must have dump it by mistake....really annoyed.",3
586,"For the price, these bowls are great. The suction on the bowls could be a little stronger, but I wasn't expecting something ultra strong when I purchased them anyway. My 16 month old can still move the bowl after being suctioned to her high chair tray, but she's unable to remove the bowl from the tray without exerting major effort.",4
587,"1) only 1 lid for 3 bowls2) infant can easily unsuction sending food flying3) rubber makes it not microwavableSeriously, there's just no reason for these.",1
588,"Magical bowl, don't worry baby it knocked over, but I don't know how this material, hope can good, no damage to the baby",5
589,"Decent bowls in that the size is good for young kids and the handles are useful. However, the suction cups don't work anymore and I honestly can't remember if they ever have.",2
590,"We love these!  They are so soft! Perfect for our son's changing pad. We've had to wash them a lot and they clean up well and are holding up nicely.",5
591,"My almost 6 month old loves his Jolly Jumper and has since the first time he tried it, when he was about 3 1/2 months.  If I ask him if he wants to get in his jumper he gets excited and starts jumping in my lap.  It is a tiny pain to get him in and out, but it's totally worth it!  I never get tired of watching him jump up and down...it is amazing!",5
592,"Perfect for travel, enough space. Nothing to complain about it. If you are looking for a practical and easy diaper bag this one is just good!",5
593,"I have an uppababy Cruz. It fits well. It works great for water bottles, keys, iPod, etc..The pockets are deep.However, the cup holders do not work well with coffee cups with lids or open containers because it sits at an angle.",4
594,"Doesn't work on umbrella stroller. :( otherwise it would probably be useful. Good luck with it fitting another stroller to work.",3
595,"This chair functions as it's supposed to. Unfortunately, the tray is really hard to put on and take off. The tray also doesn't attach to the folded up seat, which is a pain. I would definitely recommend spending a few dollars more and getting the Fisher Price booster",3
596,"I bought these for my teething toddler twins in the hopes that they would give them more relief than a regular pacifier. Saying they didn't like them would be an understatement. They literally screech and chuck these at the walls with the force of a major league pitcher. Even if there is no other pacifier in a five mile vicinity, they hate these on sight and refuse to even touch them. My two love pacifiers, if you can't already tell. These are not pacifiers. Ah well. Hey, I tried.",2
597,"My baby doesn't seem to like it. It's kind of big and hard. But it's looks pretty neat maybe one day it will actually get useful!",3
598,"I still like this storage solution because I don't have to worry about losing a bag of milk in the freezer, but I can never get the bags to fit right. I don't use first year bags because I can't find them anywhere local, and lansinoh bags are too big once frozen. They sit at an angle and take up slightly more space. What I've started doing is laying them flat at the bottom of the organizer then sitting them upright so that the bags lay a little better. Also, the spring thing that compresses the bags is really stiff and takes two hands to push back. Not a huge deal, but hard to work with while holding a baby.",4
599,"The bottom part takes up way too much space! It's unnecessary and we ended up just using the top cover. I could have easily found something else at the dollar store.The bottom part doesn't fit Medela bags!",2
600,"the organizer is really good, with good size to store 10 to 12 bags of breastmilk.the cover protects the contact with other meals and smells.",3
601,"I used a diaper genie with my older daughter. It was such a massive pain that I was going to get a regular small, lidded garbage can for the nursery and just change it daily or every other day. That&#8217;s how turned off I was to diaper systems. A friend gave me this after potty training her son, so I decided it would be worth a try. I am extremely impressed! I can&#8217;t believe all the negative reviews.I used the filter and there was absolutely no odor in the nursery. When my batteries died I decided to see what it would be like without them, so I didn&#8217;t change them. We still have no odor in the nursery. I do use Febreeze garbage bags in the unit though, so that might be a contributing factor as well as that my son is exclusively breastfed and his diapers aren&#8217;t that stinky. I&#8217;m sure once we start on solids that might change. But, the design of it keeps everything well contained, so I&#8217;m not sure how necessary the filters and batteries are, I guess I&#8217;ll see with time. The unit has never fallen over because the lid is top heavy, I&#8217;m not sure about how people have had that problem. Closing the lid does make a sound, but nothing that startles my son. It doesn't bother me at all.This has been a wonderful diaper pail for us. My older daughter thinks it&#8217;s so cool that the diaper disappears when you shut the lid. I&#8217;m thrilled that I don&#8217;t have to buy expensive, specialized bags, I can use my kitchen bags with the nice Febreeze scent. This is definitely a worthwhile addition to a nursery.",5
602,"Exactly what you need for the wipe warmer, ok price. Not thrilled at frequency needs to be replaced otherwise works as expected.",4
603,"A bit expensive for a wet &#34;pillow&#34; but it seems like it does its job well. As long as you completely wash out and soak the pad once a week it keeps your expensive baby wipes from browning and drying up. It seems like there is some sort of chemical in the pad that lasts for many washes which supposedly keeps mold at bay. So knowing their is something necessary soaked in the pad I try not to squeeze it or &#34;wring&#34; it out when I wash it off... I just run it through water until it is white again and soaked. I do occasionally wipe down the entire diaper wipe warmer with a Clorox wipe and then a wet cloth to ensure no germs or mildew can hang out and brew anywhere. I normally only replace the lionheart pads every 4-5 months.",4
604,"If you think you don't need these and your wipes will stay moist anyway (because WATER), you're incorrect. You do need these or your wipes will dry and brown pretty quickly. We do cloth wipes and cloth diapers with our baby, and the wipe warmer has been a savior. These pillows are what keeps them moist despite the heat. Once in a while, we have to rehydrate the pillow (put it under running water), but that's the only maintenance needed. We've had the warmer for 5 months and have never had to clean it. No funky smells or mildew.If you are concerned about what might be in these pillows that keeps them fresh (i.e. weird chemicals), stop being concerned :) one of my friends e-mailed them and they replied saying it's nothing toxic, but they can't release the name yet until it's pattened. You can read more about it online... but honestly, whatever it is, it can't be worse than what they put in disposable wipes and diapers, and no one's ever died from those, right?",5
605,"did not know I would need this to go with my wipe warmer. So, I like the idea that amazon recommended that I need to have this item.",4
606,"I got those and they work, plenty of spaces for 8 bottles and all their pieces. I have also considered of getting those silicon grass shaped matts, but I believe those will get dirty much faster and you won't be able to clean it. Maybe I'm wrong, but you can't go wrong with the drying rack.",5
607,"For those poor reviewers who thought this is just for storing bottles and nipples etc; you obviously don't pump at all. I consider this, or something like this absolutely necessary for the pumping mother. I need that pumping equipment dry by morning and having a drying rack like this, with so much space for drying (without taking up much space on my counter) and two tiers with hooks to hang things from, is perfecto. Love it. Buy it! It is such an inexpensive wonderful investment.",5
608,"A MUST-HAVE for new parents. Gives us an easy clean place to put washed bottles and baby items. Easy to assemble and very inexpensive.",5
609,"Great drying rack.  Simple.  Easy to clean.  Not bulky.  Takes up minimal space.  Works well for drying champagne glasses, too!  :)We can dry about 8-10 bottles at a time.  Keeps everything in one place, and only takes up a 12x12 inch space on our counter.",5
610,"It's a drying rack, it does what it's supposed to do and it's pretty compact so it fits nicely on a countertop near the sink.  It was easy to put together and has held up well for 15 months now of daily use.  It holds a good amount of bottles, caps, nipples, and other accessories.  It may not look as cute as the grass looking drying rack, but it serves its purpose for less money.",5
611,"Bought one of these to get the bottles off of the counter, spread out upside down drying. This works very well and keeps everything together. My only complain would be that the lower &#34;lazy Susan&#34; does not spin as freely as you would hope, but really its not that big of a deal. Works as expected for us and if needed I would buy again.",5
612,"We don't use enough bottles that we needed such a big rack. I overestimated based on the great reviews it got. I mean how many dirty bottles do I really need to wash at once? Like 2...it's just too big.",2
613,"We only tried this once. It was too flimsy didn't hold up well. Wasn't good for eating or holding food.",1
614,"I put this across my sons lap for long trips.  He eats on it, colors, watches iPad and builds legos.  lightweight and strap is adjustable.",5
615,"I thought this would work for our road trip, but it ended up being more of a hassle than anything else.  it's too soft of a bottom, so puzzles are hard. it gives some surface to work from for coloring, but not really at a great angle.  Maybe for an older kid it will be better, but for a two year old, it wasn't great.",2
616,"Poorly made and it does not hold heavy objects.  I returned this right away.  Don't even bother wasting your money.",1
617,"We received the dressing table in good condition.  It was easy and fast to assemble (a one person job with the enclosed allen wrench).  I liked the natural look, and the table meets our expectations.  The problem we encountered was that one of the safety belt straps was not pre-stamped with a hole.  Rather than risk the integrity of the strap by creating our own hole, we contacted the manufacturer who promptly sent us a replacement strap.  I was satisfied with purchase although the fix did take about a week to be received.  Overall, pleased and recommended.",4
618,"Purchased for baby and felt the product was a great value for the cost. They stick well to window and really help to keep sun out of little one's eyes. They seem to be well made but I haven't had to wipe them down yet.",5
619,"I wish we'd had these the moment our little one came home.  We got them in one of the mystery boxes and had to come on here to find more!  Since babies can only see high contrast at first, these are perfect!  When we were out they would calm our little one down by giving her something to look at and entertain her.",5
620,"Easy to clean, soft but not too soft for baby, lightweight, fits most changing tables. my baby likes the firmness/softness and smiles when I change her instead of screaming her head off.",5
621,"Ikea changing tables have an awkward dimension so it was hard to find a changing pad that would perfectly fit. I came across this pad and it was long enough to fit on the table. It is thick enough that my baby doesn't feel like she is directly on the table. I use a cover on it but you could get away with not using one as the plastic is not a sticky shiny one. It is easy to clean after any accidents. We have been using it for 4 months now and are really happy with it. FYI: If on an Ikea chaging table you will still have a little gap lengthwise but I use that empty space to put all the products I need while changing baby, so in the end it was all good.",5
622,"I absolutely love this gate.  My husband is tall so this was a must.  I am 5'6'' and this is perfectly at waist height, I don't have to bend while holding my baby and easy to operate.",5
623,"Great invention but a little pricey!  My grand kids enjoyed sleeping, eating and playing in these.  Easy to clean and convienant to take where ever baby goes,",4
624,"My daughter is almost 11 months old and I'm still using this daily.  This makes my nursing life so much easier.",4
625,"My boppy was my best friend for the first few months of nursing.  I had a c-section and this really helped keep me comfortable without bothering my stitches.  The covers are easy to take off and wash.  The boppy is made out of excellent quality.  After almost a full year of use, it still looks like new.  The pillow hasn't changed shape at all.  I also love that it can be used to provide support for your baby when they are trying to sit up.  I used it to support my baby during tummy time.  I highly recommend it for all moms.",5
626,"While I was pregnant I thought this pillow was overrated. I put it on my registry just case one of my friends or family members thought it was as amazing as they say. Fortunately I received on as a gift and I LOVE it! It was great to wrap around for nursing and it's also great for tummy time!  Our baby is starting to sit up so we put her in the boppy for support and comfort and she loves it! So glad I got this!",5
627,"I liked it because it was 10ozs. my 2 year old loves it and it holds more than regular ones.",5
628,"My baby loves this. He takes it to bed every night. Super soft, no padding so all cuddly. I like that the pacifier goes on the end of a long arm because it doesn't pull it out of his mouth.",5
629,"I've been to the original Bunnies by the Bay shops in Washington, I just love them.  Everything is so soft, pretty, and sweet.  They even serve pink hot chocolate!  So when I found out I was having a daughter, I knew I had to get a Bunnies by the Bay lovie for her.  This is my favorite, it embodies the character and quality of the company that I adore.  There is nothing sweeter than having her fall asleep with this in her arms.  I got one for home, one for day care.",5
630,"I love the look of this walker and my son likes the sounds and lights.  I do wish it had more toys.  I didn't have any problem with the clips like others did but I do have an issue with the locks staying engaged on the height adjustment.  My son is only 3.5 months so I put it on the lowest setting but every once in awhile I notice he's got a lean to him and I realize that the lock on one side or the other has disengaged.  I still think it's cute and can't wait until my son is cruising around the house in it.",4
631,"I really like these placemats.  They are so wonderful to stick in the diaper bag and use when we are eating out.  The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 though is that they can be tricky to remove the backing from- it's 4 strips along each edge and each has to be removed individually.  But overall they work well, stay in place and have a cute picture of Tigger and Pooh and a search for item game- though it's the same for each placemat- my son still likes them!",4
632,"We used to worry about our LO dropping food on the table and picking it up to eat when we went out to eat. No matter how much I pre-wiped the tables, I always worried about gunk that could have been there before. Enter these placemats. They have stickers on all four edges that stick very well (we have stuck them on wood, plastic, granite, vinyl...) and they cover a pretty good amount of area. What's great is we can give our LO a plate or bowl and not have to worry about if she spills a bit on the table and wants to pick it up and put it in her mouth. These pack really easy so we always leave about 4-5 in our diaper bag so we are always ready. These are great!",5
633,"This cup works pretty well. Easy on baby's mouth, and under normal use conditions it really doesn't spill. If you shake the heck out of it and bang it around, then yes you can get it to leak a couple of drops, but for general use it doesn't spill.The problem is in the cleaning of the cup. The plastic straw, the silicone spout, and the inside of the cup all get really cruddy and cannot get clean in the dishwasher. Essentially you have to take the whole thing apart, use Q-tips or pipe cleaners to get all the crud out of the straw, use a toothbrush to clean the inside of the lid, and then put it all back together again.If you clean the silcone spout too vigorously, you can also damage the little membrane that makes it 'spillproof,' and voila it is no longer spillproof.I have learned to live with this cup by soaking it immediately after use, and by attacking it with Q-tips when it starts to look dirty. But it is not the best design from the cleaning perspective.",3
634,"i love it.i take it with us for trips to grandma/pa's house so baby can sleep. since 3 months (baby's now 8) he still sleeps in it without problems. *knock on wood* from bassinet to the deeper crib.",5
635,"best playard and easy to close which was one of my concerns. I have had it for a year now and it still in good conditions",5
636,"I love this because my grandson can grow with it than only using it for a couple months - It is good for years or at least to a toddler. I love the colors because they are neutral for a girl or boy (in my case a grandson) Thanks",5
637,"I bought this only to sleep in when traveling and to put my son in when I have to answer the door or run to the restroom.  I do not use it as a ""play pen"" so it does not get a whole lot of use .  The only reason I purchased this one was because it did not have a bunch of silly prints all over it, it matched my kitchen/den area, and it was inexpensive.  I did not purchase it for a young infant, so I did not use the bassinet.  My son was 8 months when we began using it.  Despite the mesh feeling cheap, my active tike claws and scrapes at it constantly and it has shown no signs of wear or tear. I also use it to pull in front of the door as a ""gate"".  It's nothing special. I would purchase something else if I were planning to have my child waste 2-3 hours a day playing inside of it. It's small and compact which makes it perfect for travel sleeping and a temporary deposit box to keep the little one safe.",4
638,"i say it was so easy to set up it took me about a minute of to get it all set up.  i love the colors, to me it seems very light and easy to move.  i like that the raised bassnet part isnt hard.  it looks like its easy to wipe down.  the only thing i dont like is the stars are stuck on with velcrow and can easily come off",5
639,"I would say that this pack n play is useful.  I thought the top part was only useful for a short period of time, probably because we also had a separate co sleeper anyhow, and didn't use this that much.  However, we do use the bottom level a lot, esp when travelling.  That said, you can buy just the bottom one for a lot cheaper at walmart (40 bucks for any style you like).with regards to this particular pack n play style, i have comments similar to others- relatively light, about 3 pounds heavier than the baby bjorn which is almost 3x as expensive)- easy to set up and fold down (esp if you are NOT using the top attachment, but only the bottom)- I like the wheels to wheel it around- it feels fairly sturdyThings i liked better than the baby bjorn- the sides are low, more mesh, so I felt like the babies were safer sleeping there (heard about this horrific and terrible incident involving a baby suffocating in playard that had high walls)- very very sturdy, feels sturdier than bjorn- has wheelsAnother additional benefit is that it's a fun toy to place with.  My daughter likes to stick her face against the mesh and make funny faces.  It's pretty damn hilarious",3
640,"Very easy to assemble but hard to take down and not very easy to put together a second time. A few times I thought I broke it.  I wish they have better instructions on tare down and putting back together.",4
641,"Perfect for introducing solids to a baby- they are soft and the colors nice.No complaints and we use it every day, several times a day.",5
642,"My kid loves his jumperoo. I think the first word he started recognizing is jump, because whenever we say jump, he starts jumping in our laps. He gets super excited in his jumperoo and goes on and on until he either sleeps in it or gets bored of it. Its usually the former. He started playing with all the toys int he jumperoo. He figured out how everything works in it. He also aims for the overhanging birds sometimes. We got it when I was watching him alone for a month. i could leave him jumping in it and do all my chores without worrying he would roll somewhere. Now we use it when we are having our meals and he loves playing in it.Highly recommend for active babies and peaceful meals for parents ;)",5
643,"I LOVE THIS! and my son loves it. I usually don't let him in it more than half an hour because I want him to do more tummy time and interact with me instead but if I wanted to I could let him sit and jump in there for an hour and he would be happy to do so. Thanks to this I can eat, take a quick shower, clean the house etc. We also have the exersaucer but he favors this one. One of the best things we bought! We bought another one for a friend of ours. PS. We went to Babies R Us and they told us that they don't carry this rainforest jumperoo anymore because it's discontinued but in my opinion this model is way better than the new one.",5
644,"This is a great purchase.  My son loves to jump in the Jumperoo.  It was easy to put together and it keeps him entertained for at least 20-30 minutes.  I got it for him at 4 months, he is now 9 months (very mobile) and I can still put him in it while I get a quick workout in.  It does take up a lot of space, but it is worth giving up the space.  We will probably break it down in a couple of months and hold on to it for baby #2",5
645,"My son enjoys this item but has never been IN LOVE with it as he has with some of his other toys. It's a great place to set him down, especially since now he's walking, but he doesn't stay in it long before desiring to be picked up. Could just be his personality but he's not a needy baby...The other thing about this item is that it's not easy to store or move from room to room.If I could do over I would have bought something different.",3
646,"I got this for my son when he was 4 months old and he loved it right away! He is now 8 months and doesn't want to be confined but it was a great product in it's heyday!",4
647,"We'd give this five stars but the water evaporated.We also own a jumper and neither of our kids ever liked the jumper activity center.  They love being able to walk/run around this.",3
648,"each element of the case was used, the only thing is that to sterilize not withstand high temperatures, especially implements give medicines",5

650,"I am very familiar with this seat as I babysit my nephew daily and he has this exact model.  I only have a couple complaints about the seat and they're not major issues.  Now that I am pregnant, I will likely buy the same seat for my own child.  P.S. my nephew is now in the chicco next fit and I absolutely love it!Pros-Operation..all around.  The way it latches and unlatches from the base is easy.  The way the belts tighten and loosen to fit baby is great.  The operation of the handle is also much easier to fold back than some I have seen.Installation was so easy.The material feels durable without being stiff.Cons-The canopy doesn't cover much at all.The seat is quite heavy, but most are heavier than they should be in my opinion.The seat (when in the base) takes up quite a bit of space in my car (2013 Acura RDX).  It wouldn't fit behind the driver as the next fit now will.",5
651,"but the main reason why I began hating this seat is because my baby is slouched, always overheats in it, an the hood is absolutely retarded. Granted, most newborns and young infants are okay in these car seats when the car moves or a stroller is being constantly pushed, BUT in my experience the minute that stops, now especially when he is 3 month old and more conscious about what he likes and disliked, all hell breaks loose.I thought perhaps it is a safety feature of some sort to have a baby crunched in the seat, but I cannot necessarily confirm. Regardless, baby's feet and knees are higher than his ears and he looks super awkward in it. The butt pillow had to go once we reached 10-11 lbs, so that made things a bit better. I tried removing head pillow cushioning too, because even to the highest adjusted setting it seems to be squeezing his shoulders and not just head. So once removed, he wasn't comfortable either. In general, our baby is very calm, but here with pillow and without gets him all upset. The makers must have never considered that the car ride can last longer than 2-3 hours and/or with availability of all these adapters and stroller bases, customer may want to use it as an everyday stroller piece. My baby and I suffered enough, so this is going to remain in the car for good and will never be used as a stroller piece again.Another MAJOR fault of this is the fact that the hood itself does not give much protection from the sun. Keyfit 30, means that this seat would be used for newborns and young infants, thus, sun protection is crucial. This hood/canopy does not reach past 90 degrees. An extra extension visor is useless, because again, it wont add much to a barely 90 degree angled hood. Some may like the fact that it is one of those &#34;follow the sunlight&#34; type of hood, but that feature is faulty. When it is a bit windy and you decide to move the hood to the front or back, baby's head is exposed and therefore may be exposed to through wind and rays that can reach baby's back of the head. Anyway, why not make it just a bit longer so it can reach lower- I believe a friend of mine have Graco car seat and that one has a full blown hood with a plastic see-through window.Another things that i was not too happy about is the actual arm handle. Sometimes it gets stuck. I would press both orange safety buttons to unlatch it to upright position and sometimes would have to curse because it needs some yanking movements. Frustrating....If I have to say anything about this carseat that is somewhat positive- it is made well when it comes to material sturdiness and fits well to stroller base as well as the car base.....at least the Chicco one's. Overall, if you have to get one of these, do so, but make sure you do not assume that this will replace a stroller for everyday use. Leave it just for car rides.",3
652,"When my now toddler son was an infant, this was a saving grace.  The carseat was of course as safe as they come, but the whole process of installing into the car and using the lock system was so simple, it made me feel I was doing something wrong.  Again, super easy.  The great part was how easy it was to unlatch the car seat itself from the base and move your lo around without disturbing them as I would just pull the stroller from the trunk, use the release with one hand (which really does work with one hand), unclip the infant seat and &#34;pop&#34; it into the stroller...off we go.  The car seat really was wonderful.  The stroller is equally great.  It moves so easily, is easy to grip, lots of storage, the reclining feature is wonderful, the material is easy to wipe up and keep clean, the trays are a great size to accomodate many size cups/snack containers, the adjustable handle was wonderful (esp for parents that are different heights), and it gets hot and humid where I live, the material really does a good job of being comfortable.  Oh and the little pillow was very nice when he was very little.",5
653,"My friends even complained about this. However, I  decided to try it out since I didn't have the money for the hospital grade one and my insurance wouldn't cover it either. I loved this pump. It took a beating from my constant use. I lugged it from room to room, from home to the office, in the car. You name it, this thing went with me. It did have a couple little moments when I thought that I had finally beaten it up, but it still kept kicking. When I have my next one you can bet I will be continuing to use this baby til it dies.",5
654,"I might update my review after I used this pump more but as of right now I would only give it about a 3 outta 5 star the extra star is for the great customer service. I used this pump a week before suction didn't work in one side. So I was pumping boob by boob, called customer service and really they wanted to make it seem like I wasn't using it right. After explaining and explaining the same thing over and over again and putting the phone to the motor and letting them hear me pump she finally sent out new stuff n a new motor overnight which was great because I use this several times daily. I like now it's not overly expensive and cleaning it is a breeze. The last pump I used for my other children was medela ann it was harder to clean only lasted 6 months at a time but it pumped like a charm, would get all the milk and I believed helped my supply. But with medela only lasted 6 months which is madness because of the cost which is why I tried this one. My only point of ameda vs medela is because I see so many other reviews comparing the two pumps. But as far as this pump gies it's ok, customer service will replace bro hem pumps, although I don't know how many times. I think the suction for thus pump is a lot softer then medela which could make the difference of of you will like it or not depending on how sensitive your breast are for pumping. I think I prefer something more stronger to collect more milk. In less time .",3
655,"This is the best idea ever!! We have been using it since day 1. No more having to guess when was the last time baby was fed or changed. We just reset timers when we do so and no worries. My husband loves it. Even has a extra timer for anything you want, I use it to know when was the last time I pumped. Each clock has it's own alarm, there is a backlit display and a flashlight. Also a lock feature to prevent buttons from resetting, which is perfect when we are on the go and i throw it in my baby bag. Lights are useful for when baby is crying in middle of night you can use flashlight or see how long its been since a diaper change. We also use it to anticipate when baby will wake up, if it's been 2 hours we know in an hour she will start wiggling. Awesome purchase and I plan on buying it as a gift for my pregnant friends!",5
656,"Purchased for myself to keep track of baby the first few weeks home. I really like how easy it is to use and the medicine or additional timer feature that the device has. It's compact and comes with a nice night light as well as a button to keep track of which side baby fed from last.",5
657,"LOVE this timer!  If you are expecting a baby and don't have one, get one!  Bring it to the hospital!  Such a nice thing to have when you are exhausted from labor and the nurses ask &#34;How long ago did baby nurse?  For how long?&#34;  Forgot it at home the first time, but never made that mistake again! Also very helpful in the middle of the night when you wake up groggy in the middle of the night to a crying baby...no need to do any math!  We also love that Daddy can glance at it when baby cries, and he can easily know if he needs to disturb Mommy or not!My only criticism is that the clip seems to break easily, so be gentle when clipping it onto something.  Also, there is a limit to how many times it can fall and hit the hard floor without breaking!  Oops!",4
658,"I bought this Itzbeen for my first son and have recently used it again after having my second son.  I know there are apps out there similar to this format but this device is so nice when others are watching baby... Dad, grandparents or babysitters.  I also like how I don't need to scroll on my phone to find the app in the middle of the night -- I just roll over to look at the Itzbeen and it tells me everything I need!  I've purchased at least four for friends who are new mothers.",5
659,"Good size and coverage.  Perfect to cover the four corners of our entertainment center and ordering more for our coffee tables.  However I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because there isn't enough tape and the tape that is included is not great quality.",4

661,"We live in Texas where the bugs can carry you off. Plus you know when a bug bites a baby it is 10 times worse than when it bites an older child or you. This is a great buy! Plus it even shades from the sun a tiny bit.",5
662,"Born free pacifier design is very soft, like very much, I hope my baby milk there is no problem in the future",5
663,"So so, I think it is better for older kids as our daughter would try to use it to stand up and it was not stable and it got moldy really fast",3
664,"LOVE this bathtub organizer. The track was a little tricky to line up, but has never fallen apart since we put it together a few months ago.",5
665,"It does the job. But it only fits towards the head of my tub. I didn't even think about it but my tub does not have a 'lip' or edge on both sides. One side has a small corner area and then it 'blends' into the wall. So it will only fit on that small space and it's almost mid-tub which makes washing my daughters hair difficult.  That is probably my own fault for not checking before buying. Besides that, it does not slide together easily like the instructions say. I was worried I was going to break it. I also can not get my inserts in. I'm not sure how long ill use it because I can't move it from the one spot it fits. If your tub has two full edges it would probably be better. I may go the bag route.",3
666,"A little pricey I thought for a plastic organizer but it is just what we needed. I really like it and it holds all our bath toys.",5
667,"It's functional, but really small and so it doesn't fit 2 pacifiers, and doesn't have the antimicrobial lining. Probably not worth the money.",3
668,"It's a bottle brush so not much I can say about it.  It does its job and I like the suction at the bottom",5
669,"I like it. First, i was very surprised because the size of the brush but it is ok and works.",5
670,"This works well for cleaning the inside of the bottles. The little blue stand up thing is pretty useless, but who cares. I still do need the small brushes to clean around the parts though",5
671,"We use this to clean all of our Dr. Brown's bottles and Avent bottles. It is a great size and the stand is easy to use. We also tried the Munchkin bottle cleaners but the sponge top on them wore out very quickly since we use this to clean the vent piece. The sponge on this held up over a month which included jamming it into smaller areas that is used for normally (pump parts, etc.). I expect the current one we have to last 2 months now that we just have the bottles to clean.",5
672,"I was so excited to buy this and watched YouTube videos. But.... when we got it I was disappointed. I read a lot of good reviews and thought I was going to like it. Had so much trouble with this thing! Maybe it's just not for me, 5 feet tall. My husband who is 6 feet tall got it on and my baby seemed fine in it, but it just took too long and for me it was wayyyy too much fabric. Just not for us. My husband likes the Ergo baby and i like the baby bjorn for right now. All preference i suppose, but to me it was just a super linv piece if stretchy fabric that took too long to out on. =(",1
673,"Got this when we had our 2nd child.  Didn't use it very much, but it was nice to have on long walks (so your arms didn't get tired carrying your passed out wee one) or when you needed your hands free.  As soon as baby started getting heavier/wriggling I packed our Moby away.  Got a solid 3 months out of it, but I'm sure it's different for everyone.  I enjoyed it for the time I used it.  The leaf green color is excellent.",4
674,"I did not find the tray so hard to secure or remove.  It is a snug fit but it's a great addition to the seat.",5
675,"If you have a bumbo seat this is a much to add on.  It is sturdy enough to where your child is not going to get the tray off and offers a nice place to add a snack or place some toys. Easy to put on and take off.",5
676,"This design could have been executed better but overall it is effective at being a tray once it's on. Putting it on isn't so bad, it's taking it off that is really annoying. You have to pull it off and it comes off with a little momentum which sometimes made the baby jump when she was younger and we first started using it.My baby hated the bumbo and this tray for some reason, but it was convenient at times and really great for her first feedings with solids.",3
677,"We really liked this, and my daughter enjoyed having a tray in front of her for her snacks or toys as she learned to sit.",4
678,"What a huge help when strolling your baby and having this cup holder for your drinks while shopping or just taking a walk. You can easily put your drink and do more multi task mommy duties. =o)",5

681,"This is a great little thermos but I do have a couple of issues:Pros:-Keeps the food hot or cold for the 4-5 hours (put the thermos in the freezer the night before or put boiling water in it for the 10 minutes and it will keep it a good temperature)-Good size for young kids-Stainless steel so it doesn't stain or rustCons:-Narrow opening and can be difficult to get some foods out-Holds 10 oz, which is a good amount for a kid but if it's for an adult you're probably going to want to pack something else as well.  I've filled it with spaghetti for my 8 year old daughter and she said it was enough but she ate it all and I wonder how longer it will be &#34;enough&#34;-The lid/rubber ring is not easy to clean.  I use my fingernail to get any stuff out which works but is kind of yucky.Side note, we have 2, the blue and yellow and the pink flower with the black bottom and lid.  I wrote our name on the bottom of the blue but am not able to write on the black bottom.  The pink flower is adorable though, very grown up looking but since it's flowers it's still cute for a child to use and even better, they don't have a character on it.",4
682,"Keeps fruits fresh for a longer period of time than other comparable containers we've used. We like the fact that it's leakproof.",5
683,"perfect, soft, white. Fit on my crib mattress. deep pockets, so there are no pulling or fussing over getting your fitted sheet on.",5
684,"I like the sheet. It's soft and not too thin. My only complaint is that after it's washed and dried, it's very tight on the mattress.",4
685,"These sheets are so soft and fit perfectly on the graco packnpaly on the go mattress. Much higher quality and softer sheet than the packnplay branded one.",5
686,"These were suggested for our portable playpen/bassinet. They are decent material but they are very hard to stretch onto the mattress. I think they are worth it for the price though.",4

688,"By request of my child's daycare, they said 2 sheets would be required for my daughter's crib.  They provided names of several brands they know would fit the crib mattress, with American Baby Company being one of them.  Going to my local Babies R Us Store, the cost of these sheets were $9 each.  Not waiting to spend that much, I looked on Amazon and found them to be considerably cheaper.  So for $6.99 each, I got the two crib sheets required.The sheets are thin (like regular sheets) yet very soft (aka jersey knit).  They remind me of that old t-shirt you refuse to throw away despite the constant pleading by your wife.  These sheets are fitted, so they hug the mattress and won't pull off by regular use.A+",5
689,"This crib sheet was thin, cheap feeling, and, worst of all, everything sticks to the sheet. I have post-partum hair loss and so much hair sticks to the sheets and then I have to take it off strand by strand whenever my baby sleeps in the crib.",1
690,"Fits the Dream on Me 3 pack and play mattress perfectly. Matches the color scheme and has lasted a year and half so far. No complaints.",5
691,"This is exactly as it was described... I love it because the color goes perfectly with the crib (portable) I purchased..",5
692,"When I first received the sheet I thought there was no way it was going to be big enough to fit the mattress, but it does stretch to fit. I have only washed it once, so far, but it still fit after washing and was still soft. We will see how it lasts after multiple washes.",5
693,"The sheets do not fit a 6'' mini crib mattress and the material is very hard. I wish I could return them, however I already opened the package.",1
694,"We needed more sheets for the baby's  bed at daycare.  This sheet is cotton which is so important for comfort and has such bright colors.  I love giving her something special even when I am not with her.  The sheet is soft after washing and kept it's bright colors. A keeper.",5
695,"[Good]It fits our Graco playpen's mat. We didn't know these sheets existed so my mom sewed a few sheets for our playpen mat. This would have saved her some time.The pattern design is nice and modern. If you don't like this particular pattern or color, they have other good choices as well.It is safer to use this as opposed to a blanket that you just tuck into the corners of the playpen.[Ok]It doesn't feel soft but maybe this will change after a few washes with fabric softener.[Verdict]If you don't have a parent who can sew you a sheet for your playpen, I highly recommend getting this mini crib sheet.",5
696,"When I first opened the package, I noted that the fabric was sturdy, though not too soft. Not a problem, because sturdy means it should wash well and hold up, which it has admirably. It's also softened with multiple washings! The pockets fit my mini mattress quite nicely, and I don't have to struggle with putting it on.I love the golden chain link print, which is unusual but very appreciated. For the price this is a great portable mattress sheet and I have already bought anther from American Baby to rotate it with!",4
697,"I do not like writing bad reviews but I have no clue how these sheets are so highly rated! They are truly HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! The worst ever! Big mistake not putting them against my face before laying my baby on them at night. She woke up with raw cheeks (face) and her thighs were almost bleeding... I have pictures stored. I was in shock. If you love your baby please, stick with Naturepedic, Kushies Organic, or Burt's Bees Baby even Pottery Barn Kids has some sheets on sale once in a while if you are not picky with colors and themes. Please, DO NOT BUY THESE!!! Poor babies... SMH.",1
698,"I followed the washing instructions to a T and it shrunk. I had tried it on before washing and it was perfect. But after washing the material became softer and stretchier feeling and it is literally pulling up from all sides. I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement. I hand washed it cold and let it air dry and same thing - it shrunk! Other than that it is the right size for a 18x36 cradle mattress 3 inches thick. I am keeping the 2nd one bc it was cheap and nothing not sure if anything else on the market would be any better.",2

One of the spindles has even broken free from the bottom support.We didn't have any issues installing it like some seem to have. I really liked it when we first started using it, but once it started to fall apart, it went downhill fast. I will never buy from this manufacturer again.",1

705,"I have been using this pump now for several weeks because my baby refuses to BF and I want my milk supply to get going because I know eventually he will be pumping regularly instead of giving formula. I was so hesitant to buy this because the last time I had a pump I was left which nothing but pain and scars, ouch!. However the product is very good for the price. First, it comes with 2 bottles which is great because you can use them for formula feeding as well and they fit most standard nipple lids. Secondly, the milk storage bag samples are great for anyone who plans on using this for regular pumping. It was easy to put together and the parts come apart easily for quick wash up. Best of all, it doesn't hurt to pump and the plastic on the flan stics to your breast so your not using both hands to hold everything up. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because after a while of using this the suction seems to not be as good as when your just trying to build milk supply. If you have a great let down of milk this will probably not work for long but its great for occasional use and better than many expensive brands.",4
706,"I ordered this because I wanted something more portable in case I needed to pump on the go and didn't want to take my full size electric pump.  I also ordered it because I've read that sometimes people have better luck manually pumping than with an electric pump.  Not the case with me.  I found that it actually hurt, and I produced almost nothing while pumping with it.  Total waste of money for me, but I guess some people see success with it.",2

I never understood why I can either have my daughter's head protected from the nasty public changing tables OR her legs but not both. Well, I found my solution with this pad. Plenty of room for a toddler to be changed and slightly more peace of mind for a germaphobe mom like myself. We actually have a couple of diapers bags and I have found myself switching out the pads to this one whenever I can remember.",5
711,"Easy to use and install. There are steps that require you to affix it to your walls, but you can do it with the double stick tape provided and you don't have to use screws. Unlike most of their other products, this is not made on USA. This gate is made in China.",3
712,"I had originally purchased the munchkin brand gates to pen off the kitchen which was open to my living room, but they were just so ill-fitting, I could never get a nice tight fit.  These gates have withstood more than a year of use with no problems.  They were easy to install and fit really tight.  My 30lb toddler stands on them and they have yet to budge.  The latch is easy to open and stays closed when it swings closed. I also like that when fully open, the gate stays open - no swinging. Quality product.",4
713,"This is the perfect gate.  It keeps my wild toddler safe and it is easy to open and close but not too easy, as my older child can close it but not open it.  It was easy to install and did not cause any damage to the wall.So far we are very pleased!",5
714,"This is the best gate on the market.  If it fits into your opening, get it.Setup (A-): Pretty darn easy except that the expander brackets fit a bit loose before mounting so it all needs to be held together carefully.  It's a pressure mount, so no tools required.  Note that the gate first looks to be loose/misaligned when you get it, but this is normal and will get fixed when you mount it.Looks (A): Very high quality metal.  Very happy that it came in a color other than steel and white.  The burnished steel just looks like a dark grey, but it's nice.Functionality (A++): WOW, easiest gate to use, period.  Truly a one-handed gate with auto-close.  I can carry baby or boxes in one hand, simply open the gate with another, let it go, and the gate takes care of the rest. Now if only I could open it with my foot, then it would be no-hands!  Extremely sturdy gate (and my son really yanks on the &#34;jail&#34; bars).  The gate will also stay open if you open it all the way, a nice feature.  Gate has a locking mechanism by twisting a plastic knob, but I don't see any reason to use it.Overall (A): Best baby-related thing I own.  Get one or several if they fit your openings.  Well worth $55.",5

It was quite difficult to get it to where it needed to be for the gate to function and it not be too loose. The plastic knobs you turn to tighten it broke while using the metal tool to really tighten the rods so this will be where it stays and will probably be thrown in the trash when its taken down. however, it is a very tight and sturdy gate once it is in place so thats a plus. I would install this gate at the top of the stairs with the hardware mounts that were included.",4

719,"This bag was significantly larger than I expected it to be. We used it on three flights for a Combi stroller which is a bit larger than most umbrella strollers. From the looks of it, I'm sure this bag would cover our full size Chicco Cortina stroller although I haven't tried it yet. I took another reviewer's advice and reinforced the seams with duct tape so I'm not sure how much that had to do with it but the bag held up great! Only one small tear after the second flight which was no where near any seams. I packed the roll of duct tape so we were able to patch up the hole before the return flight home. The bag was definitely dirty and I was glad that none of that grease and dirt ended up on the stroller. The bright red bag was also a plus for spotting our stroller in the pile gate checked strollers, car seats, luggage and wheelchairs waiting at the gate.",5
720,"We were happy we purchased this umbrella stroller bag.  Even though the stroller was checked at the gate instead of being tossed around at check-in, I was glad our stroller was protected.

Seems clear they want the valves to fall off to force you to buy more.",3
724,"The suction on this plate has never worked but I gave up on that right away since most suction bowls/plates don't work very well in my experience. I still like this set because the plate is a lightweight plastic that won't break if it's thrown on the ground and the included utencils are very nice and work well. Beware though...the plastic is very porous and if spaghetti or anything with marinara sauce penetrates the utencil handles for any extended period of time, they will stain and become permanently discolored. Our fork's handle is now green instead of blue due to marinara staining. I don't care but some people might.",3
725,"These wonderful colorful little dishes are being used for every meal.Small enough for two to three of them to fit on highchair trays (depending upon tray size), food looks attractive and easily picked up by baby.The dishes have a nice balance, and the lid is handy should you wish to store for the next meal or so.Warm food gently in microwave as needed.  These little dishes wash up well.While dishwasher safe, I do hand wash them as I want them all to continue to be available and pristine for baby's meals.",5
726,"These have been a mainstay in our house for years:1) The are a great size for little kids meals2) They are pretty much 100% leak proof with a solid seal that lasts3) They wash in the dishwasher well4) They can be used again and again and again...5) They fit well into kids lunch boxes of various sizes.6) They are great for campingNuff said...buy them!",5
727,"I love it but it says that cames two and came just one, should be two, its a shame if not will be fine.",3
728,"if you're a rocket scientist, you might be able to figure out how to install this...but it was too much for a lawyer and an actuary.",1
729,"My daughter loves these spoons & forks! The spoon is deep enough that food actually stays on there from her plate into her mouth!",5
730,"As a new mom, I bought every imaginable spoon and fork for my toddler, now 21 months.  I stumbled upon these as a friend accidentally left one at my house.  My son loves it.  It's the perfect shape and size.  Easy for him to maneuver.  He is learning the fork mechanism now and this one seems to help!  Great buy!",5
731,"these work n they come in so handy. i mean ill have a really smelly diaper n when i put it in these if I'm on the go i can leave it in the car house anywhere n ull never know that a stinky diaper is there.",5
732,"I really like that this bottle is glass, and I REALLY love how cheap it is (&#60; $2).  Just wish the neck was wider so it would be easier to get the formula in.",4
733,"I wasn't crazy about the nipples because they are too small. (comparable to the dr. browns or lifefactory). I like a more wide mouth nipple but I use these to pump into (they attach to my medela pump). I LOVE how cheap they are.",5
734,"We had this from the time our baby was born and it got a lot of use before the plastic hinges broke when our daughter was almost a year. For an item of this price it did get a LOT of use (2x daily sometimes), so, I can't complain that it broke.I didn't find that I would wash 14 nipples in it or they would be too close together and I thought wouldn't get as clean as when I spaced them out. This was usually okay though. It kept the nipples very securely packed during the wash so I felt confident that they came out very clean.Overall I would recommend this and have had good luck with all of our Munchkin brand products.",4
735,"What a waste! I bought this thinking my 4 oz bottles would fit in it and they dont. This basket is basically only good for nipples. If I'm going to wash my bottles by hand why would I put the nipples in the dishwasher??  Just seems silly to me and Im sorry I wasted my money!",1
736,"This is a very useful product for busy mothers... works well. Couldn't beat the price...Wish I had gotten the 1st one I purchased from Amazon, (I paid more for the other one)!",5
737,"Bought this for my brother's family; he had purchased the Playtex brand basket the same day this arrived, but he claims he likes this basket better for their needs.",5
738,"It's hard to find cups that can withstand a toddler. These do pretty well. They don't leak like some of the others do.",4
739,"I was a bit weary of purchasing this set and extra sheets because they are a little more expensive than other sheets, but I think it is completely worth it.  It is so easy to unzip the top part and throw it in the wash.  With a baby you are always looking for items that make your life easier and are efficient.  This is one of those and not a gimmick.  I don't have to remove the entire sheet off the crib.  Very helpful and smart item.",5
740,"I bought this as a gift, and from what I have seen, she loves it.  Very nice to go to the store with, because baby is always close.",5
741,"The fabric is ok, the price is awesome.Baby loves it very much. Lets hear it from my baby.Oo eh woo eh woo woo ehh ehh",5
742,"These towels are thin while being absorbent and soft.  They are large enough for me to wrap up my newborn (currently 11.5 lbs) after her bath.  They are cute and are holding up well after two months of use.",5
743,"Made of EVA foam, NO weird smells, locks together nicely, and beautiful muted colors (as opposed to other garish baby mats). I love this mat!",5
744,"This has become one of my daughter's favorite toy",5
745,"My son has never really enjoyed car rides and I often sit in the back with him so I can nurse him while my husband drives but sometimes I have to go places while my husband is at work and this has worked well (most) days when my son needed a distraction and fun thing to focus on during the car ride. Sometimes he is grumpy and even this great toy won't seem to help and I have pulled over t get him relaxed.",5
746,"I ordered this for my 5 month old twins to use on their stroller seats.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got it.... so easy to take on and off.. the sting/handle that they pull and the petal swirl around is so entertaining for my kids.  The pieces also contain the &#34;crinkle&#34; material so it makes sounds and keeps my kids entertained.So happy with my purchase.",5
747,"I like this so much more than I thought I would, but then I usually love the Tiny Love items we purchase for our son. This will fit on almost anything you put your baby in.  I'll upload some pics so others can see how it attached to things, and the &#34;hinges&#34; allow it to flex and bend the way you need it to.  It has several cute features to keep the baby entertained. Pull he teether, and the green flower spins like a little fan (not fast or anything to hurt the baby). The sun in the middle has a little face and the fabric is felt that crinkles when you touch it. The hanging flower has a small mirror on it, the hanging butterfly has crinkle wings, and the thing on the other end the butterfly hangs from crinkles and has a little ball in the middle with some beads for a little extra noise making. Glad to see an entertaining baby item that doesn't need batteries and annoying baby music.",4
748,"Good toy, we have attached it to lots of things including swing, BOB stroller, Pack n play, and shopping cart.",5
749,"I love this stroller/seat bar for traveling. I used this on a four day trip with my LO. We used it on the carseat and umbrella stroller. He really likes chewing on the pull down toy.",5
750,"This is a great stroller toy...haven't put it on the car seat. When it gets too sunny this arch allows me to place a blanket over the baby without touching him.",5
751,"This toy is AWESOME!! Super bright colors to keep our sons attention at almost two months of age. It easily fits on his bouncer, car seat, and stroller. The spinning flower is neat. Would highly recommend it.",5
752,"My baby loves it. Even older kids of our friends got occupied by this toy. It fits well on the crib as well. Great find.",5
753,"This can literally go anywhere! We strap it on to the pack n' play or the rock n' play for entertainment. My five month old has been playing with this toy bar for about 5 weeks and she is just now able to reach the green butterly with the little balls inside. Up until now she has been playing with the things that dangle, which she loves. This will keep her entertained for 30 mins+. We plan to use for long car rides too.",5
754,"This mobile attaches pretty well to our Graco car seat. I like that it has a lot of adjustment points. He's strong enough now that he just pulls it to him and plays with it. His older siblings like to tinker with it too when they sit next to him. It doesn't make a lot of noise so it's not annoying and it keeps him well entertained.",5
755,"The clasps are adjustable and fit on our stroller and on the convertible car seat.  We are happy with the purchase and she loves batting at the dangling little toys and spinning the rattle ball.  Worth the money for us.",5
756,"My baby loves this thing! He can spend an hour in his bouncer kicking with his feet and watching the toys dangle back and forth. It's very sturdy so you can add your own toys to it too without it falling or bending. The clamps are very strong and rotate at the hinges so it's very versatile. You can also tilt it to 4 different positions so your baby can see the toys better. 5 stars!",5
757,"Bought this for my MIL to use in the downstairs family room as the baby's changing table is upstairs. It's very pretty and sturdy and I think it will hold up through one more kid lol. The changing pad is HUGE, which is a huge bonus because we'll be able to use it until the kid is fully potty trained. Also, I love the drawer that allows me to store butt paste, gas drops, saline and his Nose Frieda because every changing station needs extra essentials :) Overall, quite a good buy though I can honestly say, it would've been better for $10 less ;)",5
758,"Not a functional toy for a little kid I didn't like it at all I wish I didn't buy it",1
759,"awesome for car keys and holding our drinks.let's get to the best part; it's the best, cheapest alternative than the name brand cup holder that your stroller makes. boo ya.",5
760,"I went back and forth for probably a year on whether or not to buy a stroller organizer.  Boy am I glad I finally got one, especially this one.  It's awesome! We have been using it on our Maclaren stroller and it fits really well.  It hangs nicely and isn't in the way at all.  Plenty of room for sunglasses, phones etc in the center compartment.  We fit a Camelback water bottle and a venti Starbucks cup in the drink compartments today.  Get yours now, don't waste time looking and deciding like I did!!!!",5
761,"perfect little add on! Love my strollers 10x more with this handy thing on them! Fits so much and multiple pockets are handy!!",5
762,"The actual item is fine. It is well made but doesn't fit on the handles of an umbrella stroller. It would only fit if the handles were horizontal, not angled. My complaint is strictly on the description of the item which didn't advise this design issue. Alternately, it would take only a small design change to accommodate different angles of handle (like a grommet that would allow it to spin relative to the velcro straps).  I gave it away.",2
763,"Bought this for my Joovy Caboose because it has no parent cupholders. The straps aren't facing the ideal direction, but they are adjustable and it works fine. My older son has to duck under it when he rides in the back, but it doesn't bother him once he's sitting. And I love having a place to put my stuff now!",5
764,"I purchased a relatively cheap umbrella stroller, but with out the cup holder and little tray I found that I was continuing to use my more clunky large stroller even though I wasn't thrilled with its size or weight. I found this very affordable little product that has made my umbrella stroller much more useful. It has a zippered pouch to keep keys, sunglasses or other small items in, an open tray to put snacks for baby, a wallet or phone in and 2 cup holders that fit a standard sized bottle water or a child's sippy cup. All in all, a very nice product for a great price. There are other products similar to this on Amazon but I was hesitant to buy the more expensive ones for the simple fact that they were all more expensive than the stroller it self! I am glad I went with this one in the first place.",5
765,"Fred is a great toy! When ever he is touched, he starts moving forward and barking/whining. My munchkin loves to follow him around!",5
766,"I was so excited to purchase this toy for my baby when she was about to start crawling around 6 months of age.However, Fiona generated very mild interest.For me as a mom The dog looks great but my baby just wasn't that interested.Fiona plays nice upbeat melodies. It moves at a good pace: slow enough for baby to stay interested and comes to a stop within a couple of feet.Traction issues are a separate story. Initially it worked well on our wall to wall carpet. Then after the carpet was thoroughly shampooed the dog stopped moving. I guess the carpet got too plush for this dog. Mildly frustrating....Overall, Fiona is a good idea but it didn't work well for us because of the surface issues and its inability to keep baby's interest for long.",3
767,"This is very nice, it keeps the baby from scooting down in the tub and bumping her head on anything.",5
768,"We struggled trying to find a bath that would keep my LO still and from slipping around.  When I found this, it was like a God-send!  LO still squirms around a lot, but the guard rails keep her (for the most part) in place and she's able to reach around the tub for her toys without the worry of her slipping out.  LOVE.",5
769,"It is great to keep my baby sitting up in the tub but it's hard to get her legs in and out of this chair....wish the middle part was softer or had cover on it. Still does the job and she likes the smalll toys attached to it.",3
770,"lesson learned, don't put the podee tubing in the dishwasher, else you'll be ordering more of these like I did!",5
771,"My kiddo likes talking to the Octopus.  I like talking to the fat Whale.  We all talk and hang out and we babble and wobble and drool everywhere.  It's awesome.",5
772,"My LO loves everythin about Baby Einstein and octoplush is one of his favorite character. It has 3 song and each tentacle says the color in spanish, english and french.",5
773,"Our Little Man (4 months) has been a stuffed animal fiend since he's been 2 months old.  He absolutely loves &#34;Oscar&#34;!  The music is not too loud or too annoying and the contrasting satin fabric on the bottom is a definite hit!",4
774,"My son loves his &#34;hippo&#34; he must sleep with it every night. I love how soft it is and it has stayed soft after several washes. I love that I can order more. We currently have 2 so I can swap one out for washing. I also like that it does not rattle like some loveys do, and the head in the corner instead of the middle is much easier to cuddle with.",5
775,"Perfect lovey! My baby loves this and I think it will grow well with her. Good deal, oh so soft, and adorable. Safer than a large blankie for little ones.",5
776,"We bought this for my daughter after we saw others of this brand in a shop for about ten bucks more, very nice blankie. Some stitches did come loose but they were not important and I was able to burn them off without any harm done",5
777,"Both our kids have loved this blankie.  We ordered two just in case one gets lost.  Sometimes they sleep with it over their faces.  It is breathable enough that I am not worried now that they are able to roll over.",5
778,"We love this brand's loveys.  This is the only brand we use.  They wash & dry well, and the babies LOVE them!  We have used them for months now.  I used to take them out of the crib after they went to sleep, but they do not appear to impede their breathing in any way, and it really seems to help them self-soothe when they wake up off-schedule, so we leave them in the cribs with the girls.  The company might advise against that, but it works for our family.  :)",5
779,"I bought this for my granddaughter because I wanted her to have something to cuddle with that is safe, soft, and washable.  I hope she is going to like it.  It is listed on Amazon at a very reasonable price.",5
780,"I'd like them just a bit wider for my 7 month old but they fit if you pull the side tightly. I got the regular size (15-30 lbs) and can't imagine buying the larger size, I'm sure they'd be like ten feet long. hahaThese are *super* long. They're long on my three year old! My three year old is potty trained but I tried them on her just because they looked so huge! They don't fit around her waist at all but lengthwise I could still fold over some of the diaper!They're *super* absorpent!! I washed them four times before use (only one of those loads had detergent) and started using them and they've contained my son's heaviest pees and biggest blowouts. They're amazing!!I imagine if his waist grows bigger at all the snappis aren't going to work much longer. I've tried a few times just putting them on like I normally would and then not using a snappi and they've worked just fine. You don't really need a snappi I guess, I just like them and how secure everything feels. Even with the diaper unsecured I had no leaks.I could go on and on but I'll just say these are by far my favorite prefolds for the price. They're exactly what I need and I'll buy more when I need to!",5
781,"Our baby had several blowouts with disposables so we switched to these.  We've been using them for more than a month and no blow outs yet.  Using a snappy they are very easy to put on.",5
782,"So much sturdier than I was expecting.  My daughter is well contained in this.  Ordered the extension to increase her crawling area.  Easy to use.  Folds up flat.  Door is easy for adult (once you know to pull up), but hard enough for a toddler.  Would probably be great for small-medium dogs, too.  We will be using this around the Christmas tree even after the kids grow up to keep dogs and cat away.  Also great for our front porch when opened straight (with some zig zag) to block the dogs in so we can all sit out front without worrying about the dogs running after someone.  This is also much more pleasing to the eye than some of the bright colored play yard options.  Would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.",5
783,"Very well built and sturdy. I'm using it as a play yard so I have to complaints as to wall mounting issues which I've read a few reviews prior to purchasing this gate and I do strongly recommend reading those before you purchase this item. But if you're looking for a large play yard area then look no further. Super easy to assemble and very very sturdy. I also purchased the additional add on panels to add four more feet or so. Totally worth it. It gives her enough room to crawl around and fits her larger toys into it with room to spare. It's very solid so when she uses the bars to help her stand and cruise around from panel to panel it gives her something solid and stationary to grab a hold of. I give this a 10 out of 10, worth every penny I paid for it.Arrived within days of ordering (amazon prime, free 2 day shipping) Also arrived and great condition, well packaged.",5
784,"This did exactly what I needed it to. We bought 2 sets to babyproof and worked with any problems, sturdy, stands alone, and we have travertine floors. Definitely would recommend.",5
785,"I bought the Super Yard and used it just as a play yard. With these two extra panels it gives her plenty of room to cruise around with some of her larger toys in there with her. This was super easy to add on to the larger unit. As with any play yard just make sure there are no toys he/she can use as a stepping stool to try and climb over it. While the gate is very sturdy and there's little chance of the gate being tipped, it's still a slip and fall hazard for your baby. Arrived days within ordering it and packaged well.",5
786,"I spent 2 months looking for a play gate and passed over this one many times because I didn't realize you could add as many extra panels as you need.  We bought two sets to connect together, and they fit very nicely on top of our two side by side &#34;Baby Care Play Mats.&#34; http://amzn.com/B00FN74AE2I may even buy the expansion kit because we could cover the entire square footage of the mats with two more panels.Very sturdy, my 9 month old loves his new space...no more fencing him in with random household objects that topple. Two sets can comfortably hold two adults and two babies. The wood matches his crib and so many other items in the house....looks almost elegant.  I am even considering another set for the living room because it looks that nice.",5
787,"This is a really versatile gate. We baby-proofed most of the house, and use this to fence off the cat litter box and feeding area. The cats like having their &#34;room&#34; and the kid can't get near cat litter. It's very sturdy and the attachment mechanism was easy. The door latch is a bit hard to use, but we don't actually use it, so that doesn't matter to me.I've never seen a baby gate I liked the looks of as much as this one.",5
788,"we liked this color and material to match our wood floors. looks sophisticated and sturdy. The LO doesn't love being inside but that's cause he wants to be roaming. It's very sturdy and safe. we got the extension.",5
789,"wood gates are perfect to ensure less plastic around kids. It's been perfect. It's solid wood, so no off gassing from chemicals. We bought two and put them together to give more play room for the kids. As they get older, we're planning to add a third gate. Gives the little ones more room to play in without getting fussy and allows us to tend to other matters without worrying with trouble they'll get into when we're not looking!",5
790,"Size is good, colors bright but they more looking like  a piece of the foam with an animal sticker on it vs. foam shaped like an animal&#8230;. could have been done much better in my opinion.",3
791,"I have a love/hate relationship with this bib- they are exactly what you want for newly introducing solids to a baby. They wash and catch bits of food.But after using them a few times - hand washed after feeding and line dried- it develops a musty smell and even has black spots appearing (mold?)I won't be re-ordering these.",3
792,"I thought we would love this after using it at a friends house.  I can't use it now unless I have a blanket over it b/c it sheds in my baby's hands...which of course means it goes straight into his mouth.  Such a waste of $40+",1
793,"This harness is cute but we use it more as a toy than a harness.  My toddler does not like to wear it for a long duration.",3
794,"We got this to use with our 2 year old when we're out in busy public places. We don't use it often, but when we have it was great. She loves wearing it and thinks the panda is cute.",5
795,"I wish I had found this as soon as I found out I was having another summer baby.  I didn't find this product until after my baby was 5 months old. It's so convenient and easy to pop her in and out when we are out and about. It was especially useful during drop off at daycare. Wearing her freed my hands to carry all the baby paraphernalia. It was the only carrier that didn't cause her to overheat. We used it until she was almost 9 months old because I just didn't want to give it up. But she finally got so heavy it was too uncomfortable to carry her in it.  Although the instructions say it can go up to 35lbs, I couldn't use it after she was 20lbs.Although I love the different positions possible wit this carrier, I found it difficult to use facing out. One side would slip and not support her tushy properly. No problems facing in, but facing out was uncomfortable.If we ever have another baby, I'll be glad to have this from the beginning, especially if it's another summer baby!",5
796,"While this had the potential to be a great baby carrier, the sizing is hard to get right.  I highly recommend finding a store and trying it on before purchasing.",2
797,"I regret purchasing this. I wish I had loved it, but because it's not adjustable, without going into a store and trying one on with your baby, you just don't know for sure. I understand that it'll eventually stretch to accommodate your child, but it is initially too snug for my liking. We ended up buying an Ergo, and it was the best decision we made. My daughter loves to be carried and we are both comfortable.  Most of all, in an Ergo I feel that she is secure without being smothered or constricted.",2
798,"I wanted to love this carrier, but just couldn't get it to fit right/feel right for me and my baby.  It's a great style and the fabric was so soft.  Seemed way easier than a Moby.  Just wasn't the right carrier for us.  I went with a Beco Gemini instead.",2
799,"Do not buy this unless you only want to use it for a couple months.  This carrier is not an ideal solution.  It only works with small baby.  My hubby cannot use it since he is bigger than me.",2
800,"Purchased for traveling by myself with baby and needed an easy to use carrier that would help me brought the airports. So glad I went with this product. It was so easy to use and my 3 month old loved it. He could enjoy time out of his stroller while I remained hands free. He likes is so much that he often falls asleep in it. I keep it in the car and take it with me everywhere.",5
801,"Much more difficult to figure out than baby bike  and my baby was never comfortable on it do I quit using it after several tries.runs on the bigger side.",3
802,"I have not needed to use much of this set (thankfully) but I have used it to replace my tubes (which somehow obtained water and some sort of organic particles that began to mold) and the new tubes are working the way they should.",5
803,"I had another brand (though I can't recall which) of a similar design that I was hoping these would match.  These are ok, they do stick out from the wall quite a bit, but they do a good job of covering the outlet.  The mechanism doesn't work as easily as some I've seen.  When the plug is removed the covers snap back into place to block the exposed outlet.  These cover your existing outlet.",3
804,"These lightweight keys are fun because baby can rattle them like crazy without the weight of some of the other toy keys (or the real ones) that I've seen. I bought this after my son seemed to enjoy our friend's set so much. He loves to shake them to make noise.",5
805,"I noticed that my son likes this toy in the daycare, so I bought one for him. The baby enjoys shaking and gnawing this toy. He rarely likes some toys too much, but these keys are favorite.",5
806,"These are the closest I could find that were like the ones I had as a baby.  My daughter has the thicker ones with textures, etc. but she actually prefers these.  They are more colorful and are thinner and make more noise.  We bought a few to keep in each diaper bag and toy box.  Just watch out because a couple times she was able to stick the keys a little too far in her mouth and gagged.  Definitely not an unsupervised toy but it's a lot of fun to them.",4
807,"I heard on a baby blog that these are the best clippers, and they definitely are. I have a set from Safety first that are scary and I didn't even want to try to use. I ordered these, and the clippers are easier to hold/maneuver, and the blade is very sharp and allows you to easily cut even the thinnest strip of nail. Once I got the hang of using them I actually started to enjoy clipping baby's nails because it is such a breeze now!",5
808,"her mama keeps this in her diaper bag. I dont' know if she has used or not. but it is great for clipping little nails. most babies wont' hold still for this",5
809,"i can use a regular small nail clipper just fine. the magnifier just gets in the way more than it helps, and the clipper overall is cumbersome. if you need magnification, get some eyeglasses!! :)",2
810,"Looks cute and works really well. Its a good nail cutter but the magnifying glass is not very helpful. I would still recommend it given the price.",4
811,"Excellent product, it helped me keep my babies diet organic and fresh. I used them a lot when they were babies.",5
812,"Great toys for kids fun to use to learn the alphabet you don't have to tell them out because it will store water and become moldy",5
813,"We are having a lot of fun with these letters. Somewhere I thought it came with a storage bag. They do not, so be sure you have a place to keep these after bath time. They don't quite stick as expected, but if they are thoroughly wet, they will stay up. Good buy!",4
814,"I find that these cups have the following two weaknes:- colors. Although they are bright, there are no all main colors. In the picture you can see a red cup, but actually it's a bright pink one. The first and third cups' color is blue, not much difference at all- drain too fast. You can hardly tell the difference in the way different patterns allow to drain the water, as it stays in the cups for a second. The first cup has two little holes and I like it the bestSo, I don't know how to play with my son with those cups... Other than learning big and small...",3
815,"i liked the first one so much i bought a 2nd one to use while the first one still has bottles inside. it fits inside the microwave perfectly. it seems like if you leave it in the microwave for too long, there will be too much condensation forming causing the leaking problem some reviewers mention.",5
816,"We have twin 3 1/2 year old boys who used to get out of bed at all hours of the night, assuming it was morning.  i read a lot of reviews about this product, so after much discernment, my husband and I bought it.  We knew we would need to coach our boys to use it, and that this wouldn't be a magic charm unless we put forth effort to make it such.We put it at their level, so that they could see it.  Within minutes it was pulled down and played with.  So we nailed it to the wall far from their reach.  We did some practice runs, setting the clock so the boys could see what &#34;day&#34; looked like, and what &#34;night&#34; looked like.  (By the way, despite other reviewers claiming this clock is hard to set, it took me about 30 seconds to set it.  Same for my husband.)  We worked hard on reminding the boys at bedtime and every time they woke up, to look for the awake bunny.All went well until one of our boys woke up at 3 a.m., and claimed that the bunny was awake.  Sure enough, he was!  The next night, the bunny &#34;woke up&#34; at 4 a.m.At this point I unplugged the clock.  It remains on the wall, unplugged.",3
817,"We have had this for two weeks now, and my 3.5 year old stays in his bed until 6:50 AM every morning.  It is amazing.  We had been fighting 5AM wake ups for the last few months and this clock has saved our sanity.  He loves the bunnies and is so excited over the light up function and actually wants to stay in bed until the Bunny is awake.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to the makers of this product.",5
818,"I am 6 months pregnant and put this together by myself in about 2 hours. I had fun putting this together!This piece is a lot more solid and sturdy than I expected. I got this on sale on amazon and feel I got a really great bargain!  The lines of this crib are just beautiful and the frame seems really solid once it's all screwed together.The drawer and toddler rail are nice little bonuses!  The drawer is made of cheap particle board (unlike the crib). The cheap quality of the drawer does not bother me though bc it doesn't have to support much weight and won't even be seen once I add the dust ruffle to the bed. It's a handy spot to store extra linens for night time changes.I would definitely recommend this product to others!  It's simple to assemble, looks beautiful, and is a safe and solid place for your child to sleep.",5
819,"I ordered this for my son and his wife for my new grand baby girl.  It was a little more difficult to put together than we thought it would be but we did it.  It's solid and painted nicely.  The storage is very adequate and it makes a nice addition to the nursery.",5
820,"We did not feel safe using this in chairs. Despite the rubberized bottom, our six month old continually slipped down into a reclining position while in the chair. We tried it out at home before travelling with it and I'm glad we did. Maybe it would work for laps, but not in non-upholstered chairs.",2
821,"Baby loves to bounce in it, and it's color scheme isn't an eyesore in our house. The tray is really nice too. Great item!",5
822,"I bought and returned several doorway jumpers. I've tried the sassy doorway jumper that came with the Sassy Inspire The Senses Bounce Around Activity Center (didn't bounce, and the toys hung on the outside where baby couldn't even play with them), Evenflo SmartSteps Jump and Go (toy attached was awesome but seat was so low the tray came up to my baby's shoulders which he hated), Evenflo Johnny Jump Up Doorway Jumper, Up (hard to get baby in and out of, seat too low and not very roomy), and the Little Tikes Cozy Coupe Doorway Jumper (baby ripped the eyes off the front and hit himself in the face with it, the music on the toy is really annoying, and baby cried every time I put him in it).I don't know why it took me so long to try this Graco one since it's the top rated on Amazon but I'm glad I did! I can finally put the baby down without him crying!Pros for this jumper:- The bumper tray has 2 small areas and one large area that you can put snacks in when baby is old enough.- The toys are hung facing the inside where baby can play with them and the height they're at can be adjusted.actually bounces!- easy to get baby in and out of.- it IS ADJUSTABLE despite what the negative reviews say (read pg 10 of the instructions).Cons:seat is still a little low but at least it doesn't go up to his shoulders.",5
823,"We got this jumper for my son at about 3 months old and he's been bouncing away in it daily ever since! Such a great purchase for us!",5
824,"My son can spend hours jumping!  He's 5 months old (about 17lbs) and is getting better at holding himself up.  It's very light and can be easily moved from place to place.",5
825,"Great product and received it so quickly. The product is perfect for my 8 month old baby.",5
826,"My grandson absolutely loves his playard.  It gives him more room to move around, but keeps him out of trouble.  He is able to pull himself up without help, which he is very pleased about.",5
827,"I use this Playard Pen to &#34;contain&#34; my baby :) I bought the 8-panel one but use it as follow:- 5 panels used to make an closed area, from my baby-room to the living room so that she can play in her room but still come in the living room &#34;be with me&#34; as she likes to be in the living room with me -- but really she is to wild to just be left free there ;) I attach one of the panel to a steady shelf leg and/or block it with some heavy toys so it does not move and is steady and safe when she grabs it.- 3 panels to block the kitchen entranceI have mostly carpet so I do not have the issue of the panels sliding too much.I love them: I checked several playards before buying this one but definitely feel like I made the right choice. My baby was crawling all over the house and since she was standing up on furnitures she was grabbing on and picking up everything she could which made my life horrible... Now that I put on the playard, she is happy and ACTUALLY playing with her toys, which before she was not showing any interest on. The first couple times she was happy, then she started feeling &#34;locked up&#34; (only a few days) and now that she picked up the habit she is very happy as I am not behind her all the time saying her &#34;no&#34; but actually letting her enjoy.The 8 panels cover a BIG surface if you put them together but the 5 would be too small. Since they attach/deatch easily I recommend to go for the 8.",5
828,"We use this to block off the fireplace, TV and stairs. With the 8 panel it's long enough to wrap around and stay upright and sturdy. It supplements our supervision for the split seconds we aren't totally focused on baby, which is very helpful when we have our basement stairs near our living room. We didn't want to make our own gate to install on the stairs, so we used this to wrap around the stairs and all the way around the living room. The locking mechanisms make it sturdy enough that baby has actually fallen into the panel but it held up (25 lbs of baby fat pressure!). Great playard!",5
829,"Awesome to have extra bottles that can be pumped into or gives you a few extra feedings between sanitizing.  Can use with all the medela nipples and lids",5
830,"We are incredibly pleased with this! Easy to clean up (except for the play/toy part), straps come off easily for cleaning, love the fact that you can adjust how high it goes, deep enough to be comfortable for our tall child, and fits easily and securely on any chair that we have come across. Such a great deal!",5
831,"Love this because it grows with baby/toddler, fun for them while they are waiting and it's perfect and mobile to take on vacation, or just to use at the home table as a booster love it!",5
832,"We bought two of these.  They work wonderfully.  Have only used for 4 months and they have held up well to multiple washings.  I recommend purchasing at least 2 so you can switch them out when washing.  I air dry ours and it drys quickly (overnight) and keeps it's shape well.  Would definitely recommend.",5
833,"This cover is thick and plush. It has held up well in the wash, and we love the bright orange as a pop of color in our nursery. Would definitely purchase again!",5
834,"My almost two year old daughter is not always good at holding hands, so I thought I would give this a try.  I had another brand that was not stretchy, and she tolerated it.  However, there was no give, so she would sometimes fall down when it ran out of length.  The Safety 1st has nice stretchy material, so the child can tell when there is no more give and not fall down.  My daughter did not like the material around her wrist, and within a few minutes asked to have it removed.  I have read a recommendation to tie the strap to pant belt loops which is a great idea.  Unfortunately, my daughter does not have pants that have belt loops, so we will work on holding hands and I have ordered a carrier.",2
835,"I've used these for my now three year old and one year old.  I purchase a couple to keep them in my purse, diaper bag, etc.  They're a lifesaver when we're somewhere crowded and the kids want to walk (like the aquarium).  They fuss about them when they're first on but quickly forget about it.",5
836,"My son is 21 months old and itsnt even teething right now but all he wants to do is chew on these. Other than that he has no interest in them. They are very light and knock over easy so I guess that's why he doesn't like them (he loves other building blocks). Just my 2 cents.",1
837,"great for little hands. They don't slip out of little hands, roll very well, are fun for juggling... highly recommended.",5
838,"This gate is really nice. It's heavy so it feels good and sturdy. The set up was very very easy with 2 people. The gate was a lil too tight so the walk through wouldn't latch close but it was a simple adjustment to loosen the wall mounts slightly and the problem was solved. I got this to keep my 2 year old (who can climb right over our old gate!) out of the kitchen. Lil miss likes to open the fridge :) My 7 year old has no trouble using the gate and I and my husband can slide the latch and lift the gate open one handed which is perfect because I will have a newborn in my arms next month. This gate looks super nice with our decor. I only wished I could have used one more of the small extenders as opposed to having the wall mounts open as much as they are but it was just slightly too big for our opening. At any rate I love this and will definitely buy another if I ever need to. Good deal for the money and very very quick shipment for free shipping.",5
839,"Needed this gate for french doors. I was not able to directly attach a gate to the wall so this tension gate worked perfect.",5
840,"This gate seems to be one of the better gates to used at the top of a staircase.  So far our 18 month has not been able to open it.  Most of the time, the gate self closes on its own.  The gate is very stylish, sturdy, and high.  It seems to be one of the safest gates to mount at the top of the stairs and so we are happy with our purchase.",5
841,"I love these sheets.  I'm so thankful because our crib mattress fits very tightly into our crib and I have to practically remove the mattress to change the sheets.  Not now, I just unzip the dirty and zip the clean one on!",5
842,"We ordered 3 types of straw cups - these, the Playtex Lil' Gripper/Anytime, and The First Years Take & Toss Straw Cups - for our 10 month old daughter. These cups on a 5 point scale so far:Drinkability (ability of our daughter to sip through the straw): 2 stars. There is a valve in the upper straw that you pretty much have to bit to be able to drink from the straw - not a super easy concept for little ones. It is easy for her to hold because of the handles.Washability (ease of dismantling/cleaning/reassembly: 3 stars. Pretty straightforward for disassembly, kind of a pain to reassemble the straw/valve system.Leakproof?: 3.5 stars so far.  Our daughter is not gentle with cups, and the handles on this one allow her to get more leverage to fling the cup. It drips rather than leaks when it is abused.",3
843,"Around 7-8 months, we bought a couple Avent traditional sippy cups. They worked well as her first introduction to a &#34;cup&#34;. We soon wanted to try a straw cup and picked this one. She also would try traditional straw at restaurants, which at first she had trouble with since she didn't understand to &#34;block&#34; off (stop) the flow of water while she swallowed. At home, we introduced this. The first couple times, she couldn't get it (neither could I).  But by the 3-4th time, she had figured it out (i still haven't). Now, she loves it. She also has almost mastered drinking from a regular straw, I think partly because this helped trained her.  She loves these cups now. A matter of fact, our daycare requested that we send only these cups and not the sippy cups because she really prefers this. I have no issue with leaking. I do agree with reviewers who said the cup can flick water, but my baby finds that hilarious so all the better if it helps her enjoy this cup and drinking water.",5
844,"This is one of my 10 month olds favorite toys! He dances and laughs to the music. And it's nice that it is classical toons.I took one star away because of two reasons. There are only 4 songs, which I cannot really fault them for, at least there are 4! A lot of toys just repeat one annoying toon!But the sticker that the wheel has was chewed off rather quickly leaving an annoying residue behind that I am still meaning to clean off. I still let my son play with it and he still loves it!",4
845,"The songs are cute. My baby seems to love the flashy lights as much as the music. It really captivates here. I love this but have some small suggestions to make it even better. I wish that there was a way to play songs continuously so that you don't have to hit the button every time a tune ends. The speaker, being on the back, tends to get muffled if you put it on a soft surface like a leather couch.",5
846,"It has a very pleasant sound - the tunes are classic..! My baby loves to bite it - I will place pics of it when it was totally new and now... The only thing I'd change- it's that paper sticker  - watch the pictures I've added- the kid just bite the paper and it doesn't look nice.. but it's ok- the toy works - that's the main thing for me)) I just love it, wanna buy more and more of Einstein toys for my angel.",5
847,"This toy was my baby's first favorite toy. From around 2 months old he was enamored by the blinking led lights this toy illuminated with when the music was engaged. He would just watch and watch-- it was adorable. It didn't take him more than a few days to learn how to push the button to engage the song and lights. What I also love about this is that the music is actually fun to listen to and not too repetitive, there are 7 classical melodies which are quite lengthy and sound very nice. The smiley caterpillar and colorful moving beads on the handle gave my baby something to play with other than the music button. This toy offers an off / low / high option which is also nice. The reason this toy did not earn 5 stars is the durability. Young babies/toddlers have a tendency to throw and/or drop toys. This toy eventually stopped playing after it was smacked / dropped one too many times. Since it isn't too expensive I bought another but I do wish it held up a bit better to baby abuse.",4
848,"My baby loves this toy. He loves listening and bouncing along to the music. I love the two volume settings so it's not always blaringly loud. I only wish the little colored balls on the side were more squishy and not so hard. Baby loves to stick them in his mouth because he's teething.",4
849,"THis is a great music option in the car...which I can turn on with out looking or give to my son to play with and he gets a kick out of the pretty lights.",5
850,"definitely a good buy.  6 months later, my daughter still loves it and play with it from time to time.",5
851,"Two volume levels and off/on switch is nice. Music is entertaining and also doubles as a teether. Easy to hold on to and attach to links.",5
852,"Cute and very entertaining, plays lovely music and bright colors, also great to takr along on any outing keeps my child busy listening to the classical tunes",5
853,"This has been my baby's favorite since birth up until 8 months of age. Now at 9+ months we rarely use it anymore but it's been great.As a mother I am so thankful to this toy because it assisted me with so many times in diaper changes. When baby started becoming increasingly mobile turning on this toy so many times provided just enough distraction for me to quickly change the diaper.The selection of melodies is nice. The volume is just right, not too loud. The head of this little yellow creature is perfect for mouthing and biting.The batteries last forever.It is also a great toy for traveling.Would buy again!",5
854,"All of the reviews are true.  Babies just love this toy.  It's got a low and high volume adjustment and plays a few songs.  Each song lasts a good minute or so.",5
855,"I bought this for my granddaughter to have in the car when she is sitting in the car seat.  The music is pleasant and keeps her busy while having to sit in car seat.",5
856,"My son loved this he is four months old.i would recommend this for any baby they will like it music is fun and has volume controls.",5
857,"my nephew just loves this. easy to hold and large button to push. I really like that it plays classical music.",5
858,"Our son HATES the carseat - screams bloody murder the entire time he is belted in.  Another friend recommended this toy and it has been a LIFESAVER.Pros:It lights up to keep him engagedHe can easily hold itHe can easily switch songsThe melodies are played in lower tones so we don't want to scratch our eyes out after listening to it for half an hourCons:We only have one that we lost for a whileWe are going to purchase several more - one for daycare, one for each car and an extra just in case one gets lots.  Seriously - everyone I've talked to with children LOVES this toy.",5
859,"I love this bag.  I can carry it and so can my husband.  It's gender neutral.  The strap is comfortable.  It easily attaches to my baby's stroller.",5
860,"Once my granddaughter was old enough to have a regular bumper in the crib (versus a breathable one),  I purchased this.  It is your basic bumper and worked fine.  Easy to put in the crib and I was very happy with it.",5
861,"I had been looking at crib skirts on Etsy but ultimately couldn't justify spending $40+ on something just to decorate the bottom of the crib. This is exactly what we needed - a pink crib skirt and it was super cheap too. It's held up well for the past 18 months so definitely a great buy. Very happy with my purchase.",5
862,"We love this chair and use it at home all the time. It's very easy to put together and use. It's also very light and compact for on the go. I'd recommend buying a silicone mat to put under the parts that grip the table. Not only for baby's food messes, but will help protect the table from any scuffing, although we've yet to have that problem.",5
863,"The product design is very nice and it mounts to my table which has a 4.5 skirt on it.  My 18mo was unable to pop out of it despite there not being a 5 point harness.  The quality it very nice and cushiony.  My 4 1/2 year old daughter thought it was very fun as well.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it is really designed for a child who is not a self eater yet.  There is pretty large gap between child and table so you know what that means. .. ginormous mess if you were to even think of allowing them to try to feed themselves this way.  There really should be an attachment tray but for some reason there is not one available for this travel seat:/  I am returning it and ordering a simple chair mounted highchair.  I bought one for my mom years ago and not sure why I didn't just do that sooner.  This chair would be great for restaurants but again, not for self feeders.",3
864,"If you have a smart kid, just don't buy these. You'll fool em for MAYBE a day. Then, you've just wasted your time and your money.",3
865,"Hard to install.",3
866,"Once you realize how many things you need to put in this bag, you will realize it is NOT enough space.  I like the pockets but definitely needs to be a BIGGER bag.  Regretful we got this one b/c most of the ones I see in stores and that moms carry are bigger.",3
867,"This was a gift for my daughter.  I love the case and she uses it for school lunches.  The print is darling and brings back many memories of my grandmother's kitchen!",5
868,"If each section could be made a bit deeper (while still keeping the fill line at the appropriate height), the milk would be less likely to spill out of each section.  Also, if the lid would somehow snap on, that would make transportation easier.  If the container was airtight, that would also improve the product.",2
869,"Works great. Installation was not simple. Installed to instructions and it leaked. Leaked from joint put together by manufacturer. Tightened that joint and managed to stop leak.",3
870,"I like this because it had a pressure nozzle to adjust the flow of the water.  However it makes a mess.  My husband hated this thing but to be fair he has a bit of a germ phobia and initially when spraying a soiled diaper it made a mess causing it to splatter everywhere.  For me though it was much better than the idea of dunking my dirty diaper.  I keep my hands out of the toilet and was just careful while spraying.  It's also very good quality sprayer.  Now I just use it to clean my toilet as we stopped using cloth diapers.",4
871,"This is a disappointment as it doesn't make much of a rattle sound and that is not holding my granddaughter's attention for very long. She's a year old; maybe OK for younger babies.",2
872,"he's just now beginning to really hold items. he loves the color and noise but he may be a bit too young as he does bang this into himself.",5
873,"These teethers are the perfect size, weight and texture for a five month+ teething infant. They are easy to grasp, lightweight for them to hold up to their mouth without getting fatigued, and a softer texture/surface than some teethers - like the nipple of a pacifier, but sturdier. They can be refrigerated to offer a soothing cool sensation for baby since they are filled with liquid. I have one in my daughter's crib, the toy bin in the living room and in her pack & play that we keep in our bedroom. She hasn't been a fussy teether, so maybe some won't have the same experience as me. But they have been the easiest for her to use so far. And for the price, I recommend them.",5
874,"Great colors and price! It's nice that it comes in the 3 pack.... When my baby drops one, I have 2 spare teethers waiting in the freezer.",5
875,"When my 13 month old twins finally got teeth, we needed to start a nightly brushing routine.  These are great because they love to walk around and kind of play as they brush, and they seem to love to just chew on the brush head of these.  I don't worry about them tripping because these are flexible, and they are easy to sterilize in the dishwasher or our steam sterilizer.  They're great!",5
876,"We moved up tithe higher flow nipple with our three month old.  I know it says 4+ months but she was getting frustrated because the slow nipple was not letting enough out.  She had to get use to more milk with each suck so we had to be careful for about a week, but now she is a happy eater.  And she seems tosspot up less.",5
877,"We've started adding rice cereal to my little ones bottle and with the slow flow nipples the rice was constantly clogging the nipple. We gave these a try and although the rice cereal doesn't get clogged, the formula comes out too fast. I feel like there should be a happy medium between the slow and medium flow.",4
878,"I needed a reclineable highchair because my baby has low muscle tone and is not able to sit upright yet at 6-months. I bought this feeding seat at the recommendation of his occupational therapist.Pro:-ReclinableCon:-Tray is not flat when chair is reclined.-Seat back cannot be adjusted while its attached to a chair and definitely not when the baby is sitting on it.-Front part of cover cannot be attached to plastic chair, so my baby's shifting legs caused it to keep coming up.-Not a 5-point harness. This is probably irrelevant for a typical baby who can sit up straight on his/her own, but with my baby, the lack of a 5-point harness allowed him to flop to the sides too much. If my baby could sit up straight on his own, I wouldn't need a reclinable chair.-After assembling the back of the chair in place, it cannot be removed. This is annoying for taking it out of the house because it makes it so bulky, but it also make it impossible to put back into its original box for the return.The Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair is much better and addresses most of the cons of this product.",2
879,"i like this very much. i started using this when my baby was about 5 months (holding his head up without difficulty and for substantial amount of time).the ONLY thing, for me, that could be better is the tilt mechanism. like others have pointed out, it's very difficult to do it by yourself.",4
880,"We loved this seat! My little one started her first meals in this chair. It is very comfortable and easy to clean.",5
881,"THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BESTS PURCHASES OF MY LIFE!First of all you will love this soooo stable and secure base!I have twins, i can move and place the chairs SO SAFELY in practically ANY SURFACE AT MY HOME!it makes me so easy to feed them! because I put them on the top of my dinning table and I can feed them on my feet (for me it is very uncomfortable to feed them sitting down!)both babies are comfortable!!!! they love their chair!!!and also the cover is soooooo wash machine safe! and they look perfect! as new before washing them!I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS MODEL (Because the new one does not has a soooo secure base)",5
882,"My boyfriend put this together for my 18m old son. There were a few times he cursed, due to being frustrated, but it turned out nice! And free shipping!",5
883,"I love the Playtex system, especially the drop-ins as it makes the bottle really light and babies can hold it every early with their own hands. For us worked the slow natural latch silcone nipple, the y cut nipple (awesome for quicker feedings) and the ortho nipple (short one). The medium and the fast flow nipple didn't work at all. Both of my sons (2.5y apart) choked on them and the constant drip makes a quite a mess. Try the Playte y-cut or the short ortho nipple instead.",1
884,"my baby was born with an abnormally large mouth. he didn't take binkies for his age and spit out and screamed when we tried other nipples. low and behold, turns out his mouth was too large to properly latch onto the smaller nipples and binkies. switched to a larger binkie and a more &#34;natural&#34; breast-shaped bottle nipple and he was a happy baby. hopefully this review saves some other big-mouthed babies' mothers some grief because it was hell figuring this out!",5
885,"Purchased this almost a year ago when my son turned 1. He loves to sleep on this pillow.",5
886,"So charming! Bought the raccoon for my 3 month old to help with tummy time, and it made a big difference! He doesn't like tummy time, but laying on this helps hold him up, and the other big trick is to put him on this near the edge of the bed, and then I sit on the floor next to the bed, so that we're at eye level. This pillow and that trick made all the difference!I agree with others that the velcro is rough, and the quality of the velcro and sewing is not amazing, but it's just so cute I don't care!",4
887,"These are so great I wish the had them for my other one.  They do leave a little mark but just rub ur  finger over it and it takes it right off.",5
888,"Great solution to eating out with little ones.  They have adhesive strips on the back, around the edges to keep it secure on the table and easy to remove when you no longer need it.  The pics keep the kids somewhat entertained, depending on the age.  Great solution to kids dropping food on a restaurant table & picking it up to put in their mouths.  At least you know it's clean.",5
889,"This is the best thing for traveling without your kiddo. It's hard to notice and very compact with all of the power needed. I haven't tried the battery pack because I always have access but I bring batteries as a backup at all times.",5
890,"I bought this model 3 years ago from the UK and have used it over a total of over 25 months (both my son and my daughter) carrying to and from the work every day during this period  and I strongly believe that it can handle at least two more children (too sad they don't recommend selling or donating this item)  with no problems at all. All I needed to was to change the breast shields three times and buy a new adapter when I moved to US.Based on my experience, I give this product 5/5 I wish I could give more. Worth every cents. It is a complete set that includes everything you need. bottles to express milk, insulated bag with ice packs to keep the milk cold until I come home.Using this machine I can easily expresses more than 150ml in under 15 minutes. Very handy and perfect design for out of home usage. Owing to this product our little one is fed entirely on breast milk plus we even donate some to the milk bank. Due to positive reviews from those who have used more than one pumps we initially decided to go for this model. It is very expensive in compare with others but having used it more than 4-5 times a day every day, we have never been let down with its performance.PROs1-No leakage to the tubing or engines as some people experience with other models2-Around 75-100 ml/10 minutes (considering you give a gap of 3 hours between expressings or feedings)3-fits well in philips avent sterilisers (both microwave and electric ones)4-BPA free all over.5-Easy to clean. The plastic compartments stand well to twice a day steam sterilization too. (not recommended for the tiny tubing)6-A complete pack from ice pack to insulated storage bag and built in carry bag.7-Works on both mains or battery (needs 10 AA- never used)8-One mode for stimulation and another for expression9-Each mode has a range of suction strength settings10-Fits all standart neck baby feeding bottles. ( I never used the plastic bottles that came with the set. I like glass better for health reasons and I confirm that these adapters fit ok to standard neck baby bottles...)CONsnone yet.Tips:1-check for the best price deal on internet...2-Although it is not recommended to be used as second hand. I see no reason why it should be so. I have never experienced milk finding its way the electrical compartments and contaminating there. All you need is to change the tubing, breast shields and connectors or sterilize them.",5
891,"I knew I wanted a Medela pump as they have the best reviews, but choosing between the pump-in-style options and the freestyle was more difficult. Eventually I decided on this option and so far it is exceeding my expectations at 2 months. Good pump strength which allows you to start off pumping gently and increase speed/suction as you get more comfortable. I don't think I would gain anything by having the freestyle which remembers your previous pump strength/speed. I use this multiple times per day - I couldn't forget where to turn that little dial if I wanted to. Parts easy to clean. I do recommend getting the Medela Easy Expressions Hands-Free bra. I use it every time I pump so that I can do other things (read, type, etc) while I'm pumping. Potentially you could mimic the freestyle pump by wearing the hands-free bra, using battery pack and wearing as backpack. Good size, not heavy. Backpack is small - really only the items shown in the picture will fit in the backpack comfortably.",5
892,"I love how soft this cover is compared to the ones that come with the boppy. I have three covers in case she spits up or other while nursing. It doesn't show in the picture but the back of this cover is green. I would have preferred all cream colored, so that's the only reason it doesn't get a five star rating.",4
893,"doesn't give the same amount of pumping power as the plug into the wall. this is disappointing because i was hoping for some freedom. it does get the job done though.",3
894,"Easy to use. I found I needed to up the speed on the pump when using in the vehicle. Just wasn't enough power like from the wall socket, but upping the speed on the pump gave me the same milk output as I would have had at home.",4
895,"I've used these with my three youngest for about 4 weeks following birth. These have a great shape and size. They prevent and/or heal cracking and pain. Every mother with a new nursling should have these. Of course, if pain is an issue find a Lactation Consultant to check your baby's latch! Position is critical for comfort and success!It is the rare woman who is physically unable to nurse. Help your new Mom succeed by providing her the nourishment, support (aka time to sleep,) encouragement and tools she needs. Yes, breastfeeding is challenging for the 1st few weeks, but Mom's can conquer the world if they are supported! You can do it, Mama!",5

897,"I love all of the Lamaze toys, we have quite a few but I really love this one.  First off my son's name is Logan so that had me sold right there :) and he has a thing for lion toys so this was beyond perfect.  It has this great sound effect in the head that makes it sound like it is purring, it sounds like a ball that rolls around in the head.  Very cute.",5
898,"This system is great! I pump directly into the bags and refrigerate upside down as instructed and I haven't had a single leak. These do not, however, work with the new playtex bottles- as in, you CAN'T just drop the liner WITH the ring into the bottle and then attach the nipple ring and nipple. Well, you CAN do this, it all does screw together but WILL leak (and not a slow leak either). So, all I do it quickly and easily remove unscrew the cap and remove the ring that connects the liner to the cap and drop the liner ALONE into the bottle :) easy peasy. I just ordered my second set. I did freeze one the way someone else recommended: With ring/cap in place and freeze upright, then once frozen, remove cap and ring (to continue using them) and place frozen liner into a ziplock to keep in freezer. I have not thawed it yet so can't comment on leakage there. I like my other (flat) freezer bags better as far as space saving so that's why I only did one like this just to try it out. Highly recommend for the pumping mom :) I exclusively pump so this is a lifesaver.",5
899,"I love this seat. This was our 3rd purchase. My 7yr old uses hers as a high back booster and my 4 and 2 yr old as a 5 pt harness.",5
900,"So far these car seats work with no problems.  I bought two for my car.  My grandsons are now two.  Adjusts easily as they grow.  Waited a couple months for recall buckle.  But once we easily installed the replacement it was so much easier to latch then the original ones were.  I'm defiantly getting my monies worth with theses car seats.  And will look forward easy transformations as my grand children grow from infancy to child!",5
901,"I decided to get this seat when our other seat hit its expiration date.  I love everything about this seat. Its lite weight compared to other seats. Lots of tushie room for the little one. Amazon had the best deal that I could find.  I love how this will grow with my very tall little one.",5
902,"I bought this because my 4 yr old son complained his back hurt in his britax.  This seat is more comfortable but not great.  The latch belt is behind the lower back padding so the back is not completely flat.  Also the latch is easy to install but a nightmare to take off when tightened.  We are using the seatbelt to install the seat and put some thin foam pieces behind the lower back padding.  So the seat works for us now but it was not the ideal purchase.",3
903,"We purchased this car seat when our son turned one three months ago. This seat is smaller than other convertible seats we have seen, yet it still has lots of protective support. The seat has a recline feature, but it doesn't not recline a whole lot. We like that the seat is black and gray because it blends well with the interior of the vehicle as opposed to having a brightly colored seat. The seat is easy to install and use.  So far, our only complaint is that the seat does not provide head support when the child is asleep, so his head hangs forward. We purchased a toddler neck pillow to fix this problem when we know he'll probably be napping on the ride.",4
904,"We have a brand new Britax Advocate which is a LARGE carseat for baby and it is a snug fit and it is difficult to put on with one hand. I have to hold baby on backseat and try to maneuver the corners to get the shade to work. I am sure it would work better if we had a smaller carseat but I chose a larger seat for a reason. Fits well over the Chicco infant carrier and base that we use in the other car.",3
905,"We live in South Fla and the buckles on our car seat would be burning hot in the afternoon. this works great to keep thos metal part from getting too hot.",5
906,"I switched all my bottles from a level one to a level 2 around 4 months. These nipple packs were the best deal on the internet, I shopped many stores trying to find them but they always seemed to be out of stock or only had the regular size not the wide neck.My baby prefers the wide nipple for some reason?? These were shipped fast.",5
907,"Very awkward for my son to use. He kept wanting to put the whole nipple in his mouth or would push his face inward. I can see where it would be great for breastfed babies, but not for those who are accustomed to bottles.",3
908,"Out of all the covers for the wall sockets, I love this one the most! My daughter can't get them off, and I still can without using the thing I'm trying to plug in to pry it off the wall! I haven't used the door latches yet, but there are plenty of them as well and I will be using them once my daughter gets a little older. And the door handle covers I didn't really like. My daughter isn't tall enough to grab the doorknob yet. I tried one out for two weeks just to try it for myself and it was really difficult to use. I feel like my doorknobs might be smaller than normal as I had a hard time grabbing the doorknob through the holes of the cover thing in order to open the door. Overall though, I did like how little it cost to get a big amount of items!",5
909,"The child portion of the seat works pretty well, though ours still slams down pretty loudly. I haven't noticed it having any sort of soft closing feature. The adult seat is a little too narrow and uncomfortable to sit on, but not too bad. However, after only a few months of use, a connector or rod or something has come off one hinge and now it just hangs loose on one side with no way to reconnect it. The seat is still usable, but we have to be very careful not to shift to one side and slide the whole seat off the toilet. Very disappointed, since it was working so well at first.",2
910,"You can never go wrong with these swaddle blankets. They are too cute. The only problem which eventually goes away from this group is the painting from the designs one  side is a bit rough. After several washing they go soft.",4
911,"We use these blankets every day. Perfect vfor swaddling and I also toss one over the car seat in place of a car seat canopy when we are out and about. Love the cute prints.  We get so many compliments.",5
912,"I think I said it all in the subject. They may seem pricey but for 4 of them, it really is worth it. They are nice and big. When our baby was really little, we folded them in half to make swaddling easier. By about 6 months, he still enjoyed being swaddled to sleep and, since we purchased these large blankets, we were able to swaddle him without a problem. The muslin is so nice and soft and breathable. I really can't say enough good things about this product and this company. These were actually the second set of 4 of these that we purchased. We found that baby made enough messes that 4 of these weren't enough when he was really little! Our first purchase was the same size blanket but in the jungle jam pattern. We love them so much. Worth every penny.",5
913,"These are the boutique brand and they are thicker and slightly larger. I love them for extra coverage and/or warmth! I got them for the same price as the bridge line (Aden by Aden and anais) bonus!",5
914,"I live in southern AZ where it is SUPER hot. So taking a baby out in the daytime is a production that shouldn't involve a blanket. These swaddlers fit the bill. They are lightweight, breathable and have a white base, which reflects the light. I swaddle my son for sleep with them, use them as a light blanket at home and as a carseat and nursing cover when I'm out. My son absolutely HATES his head to be covered when nursing and this is large enough that I can get under there with him (Yes, I do get plenty of side eyes, but it's the only way he'll eat under there) and be completely covered and able to breathe. The material is fabulous. I want more!!!",5
915,"I have bought several of these for baby shower and baby gifts.  They are absolutely the best and every new Mom loves them.",5
916,"We are very happy with these muslins and get much use out of them BUT not as swaddles. Just as covers, blankets, towels, burp cloths. nice, comfy material.",5
917,"I've used this on Virgin America flights (Airbus 320). The molded design of Virgin America seats require that the horizontal strap has to go OVER the tray table of the passenger sitting behind the child. If someone is sitting there they won't have use of their tray table.It's still a lot less trouble than hauling a car seat on board, though. I'd still recommend one if you're trying to pack lightly. It's relatively easy to install and quick to remove.As for concerns about the child slipping, I cut a small piece of a non-slip rug pad and put it under my daughter. No slipping!",3
918,"We had a big family vacation with seven of us on the same flight, including our four year old daughter. Travel in groups is always a frenzy, and the last thing we wanted to do was add schlepping a car seat to the mix.I had seen this harness previously and had been mentally tracking it, and as our trip approached I did more research and decided to buy it. Bottom line is that it works like a charm.We were lucky enough to have seats with no row behind us so we did not have to worry about disturbing a stranger for the initial setup, although the impact to the people behind you is only cosmetic (there's a strap going under their tray table when it's in the upright position).One of the flight attendants came by and said that in 20 years of flying she'd never seen one before. I told her that her airline (American) states on their site that they are approved for use on their planes, and they even sell the harnesses there. I was worried she might question the device, but she was merely curious and seemed fascinated by it.Our daughter had no issues with it, which may be in part because it fastens similarly to the straps of a car seat. I'll echo other comments that the lack of a between-the-legs strap seems less safe than having one, but in actual use she felt quite secure.Bottom line, I highly recommend this to parents traveling with kids. It folds up into a small pouch, it's simple to use, and it makes travel significantly easier.",5
919,"This is the only diaper cream I've used but when my daughter starts getting a little red I'll put this on and by the next diaper change she is clear. She breaks out worse when she's at daycare and if I use it every diaper change over the weekend she'll be completely clear for the start of Monday. I try to just apply every night and she seems to not have any issues. Love it!",5

921,"Bought to do Insanity exercises on it since I need anything softer then concrete. After 4 week, pieces are not staying together anymore... my weight is 172 pounds.Probably is good for lifting weights or any static workout, but not for fitness type exercise with some type of movement.",1
922,"These feel like plastic. They have such an overriding plastic feeling that I would even put them on my baby. They have a very scratchy thin feeling to them. I guess they may be good for the price, though. I guess I can't speak to that. If it's for catching drool. I find my preference is just a cloth bib. I'd rather change the bib more often and let the baby be comfortable",1
923,"This one fit the bit and was very adorable, so I snatched it up.The good:- Cute- Cotton is more comfy for my and my baby in warmer weather- Cotton doesn't get scuzzy too quicklyThe not so good:- Started fading after the FIRST wash.

925,"I have ordered two of these packs. They are a must have for our family. They are great for the changing table because they are waterproof on the bottom but soft and cushiony on the top. If she leaks or pees while changing, it doesn't go through to the pad. Easy to clean in the wash machine, but don't put them in the dryer. They will shrink!!!",5
926,"My sons loves this. even before he was teething he figured out by biting on it it vibrated. months later he still loves it! we have definitely gotten our moneys worth out of this one.",5

928,"I purchased this liner for my 10-month-old daughter's crib. We have never used bumpers, but I knew I needed to get something because she was constantly getting her legs/arms stuck in the crib slats. It wasn't the easiest thing to install, but I am so happy with the way it turned out!",5
929,"Once our 4 month old began rolling over at night she would sometimes get her legs or arms stuck in between her crib rails- these cribs liners were the answer! Very easy to set up and fit our babylettoCrib perfectly! They seem safe and are even somewhat soft. I would highlyRecommend.",5
930,"This crib liner is great. We use it along the ends and the back side, but leave the front open so our little buddy can see through the front and so air can flow more easily into his bed. The air, however, wouldn't be much of a concern since this is mesh.Pros:+Very soft+Very easy to install+Nice tight installation, unlike many/most bumper pads that are simply one length, take it or leave it+Velcro all along top and bottom at each end for simple installation, just loop it around a slat or corner post and stick it to itself. Doesn't get easier than that.+Comes in many colors, but this one is white...not kinda white, not off white, not yellowed white...pure WHITE.+Two pieces allow for simple configuration of many kinds in various types and sizes of cribs, cradles, etc...it will fit whatever you have.+VERY reasonable cost for what you're getting.Cons:-The two pieces might be a tad longer than you'd need for a mid-size crib, but one piece isn't long enough to go all the way around. However, this is merely an UNTESTED ASSUMPTION on my part. Take it with a grain of salt.Overall, if you're looking for a high quality, easy to install, good looking, soft on your baby's skin bumper/liner, you can't go wrong with this. I'm very happy I selected this one!",5
931,"Our daughter is a very active sleeper. These liners make us feel much safer. She can roll around without getting her legs stuck in the slats, but we don't worry when her face or head are up against them. My only problem with the product is that it's not terribly attractive.",4
932,"This is great if what you're worried about is your baby getting his or her arm or leg caught or stuck in the crib slats. But realistically, once your baby is old enough to do that, they're also old enough to roll around and push their face up against the liner (like mine) and although it's breathable (we did test that on ourselves, if only to look like idiots) you do start to worry about your kid sleeping with their face pressed up against it. We only ended up using ours for a few weeks, and then just decided to deal with the stray arms and legs.",4

936,"I am used to the Nuby spoons so the transition to this one is strange.  This one has a very shallow spoon so unless the food is thick, it slides right off.  The metal handle is not really comfortable either.  The nice things about this spoon is that the tip is more rounded, so when wiping it against my sons mouth to clean off food it doesn't irritate and the color change is more sensitive.  It is good for thick foods such as thick cereal, 3rd stage foods and ice cream but by the time you are to that stage of foods, the size of the spoon head negates the positives, you can't get enough food on the spoon to satisfy a hungry mouth",3
937,"I absolutely love these spoons! They are small for baby's mouth, and smooth on the edges, plus the white hot sensor is awesome for when I feed her sweet potato from my plate. I always know when it's cool enough without testing it.",5
938,"Almost immediately after my daughter was born I started pumping once or twice a day and when I returned to work when she was 5 months old, I also pumped three times while at the office.

Medela is offering me a 30% discount to buy another one.SERIOUSLY?If you can swallow Medela's evidently horrible customer service, at least buy a Pump In Style, not this piece of junk.

944,"I certainly like the lap pads and use them to change my baby everywhere I go so my baby is on a clean surface.  Helps protect my clothes when I need it.  Great size and has multi uses.  Works super in strollers to help protect the lining.Bought Grammie some for her house too.",5
945,"The size on this sheet is good, and I took care to wash on cold and line dry but it still pilled up after the first wash.",2
946,"I got this to use under a pack and play sheet. It isn't the same size as the pack and play so if you put a sheet on top of it (which according to the directions you should) it bunches up. I gave it two starts because it does work. It is waterproof and protects the mat under it.",2
947,"These work well, but they are not as easy to work as the ones I got at Wal-mart.  These hold but are a little more difficult to slide back and forth.  I guess in reality that would make it harder for a toddler to use also.",4
948,"My husband was adamant about having a diaper bag that he'd feel comfortable carrying... and he carries it 90% of the time when we're out and about.  We use this bag every single day and have definitely put it through its paces. Used as an outing bag, carrying supplies to and from daycare, travel,etc.  Love the messenger bag style and the organization of the compartments.  The look is great and my husband feels comfortable carrying it, as do I.  Unfortunately it's not the roomiest bag...when it's full of a day's worth of cloth diapers and reusable wipes plus a wet bag and change of clothes for daycare, it doesn't always fully close.  Definitely not made for cloth diaper use (the recommended compartment for diapers is a flat zippered pocket on the back...great for disposables though).Unfortunately, 20 months of use has maxed it out.  The plastic &#34;ring&#34; holding the strap onto the bag failed and broke very suddenly.  We'll contact customer service shortly to see if they can help us but if not, we'll be looking for another brand that is more durable.  The rest of the bag just has normal wear-and-tear as you would expect from 20 months of daily use, but this seemed unusual.",4

954,"I wish I had ordered these with my first kid.  They work so well.  Just don't use them on a little umbrella stroller because if you put anything of weight on them, it will flip the stroller.  We use them on a Joovy Caboose and have no issues.",5
955,"This product met my expectation. Soft cotton material & that's important in buying stuff for the baby. I recommend Do not put this in the dryer after washing to maintain the good quality of its velcro. Glad to have this for baby's comfort. Must have for newborns.",5
956,"I bought this for our youngest to prevent her plate from ending up on the floor. IT WORKS! We have a smooth, lacquered wood table instead of a high chair I have always used a Graco Tot N Loc with each of our 5 children. To make the suction strong I run the underside of the plate under the faucet, then flip over and put the food on the plate. I do not cut on this plate as the material won't stand up to much abuse. Then, I place the plate at the table and push down on the center. We've had this for 6 weeks and I should have bought is sooner. The price is well worth the quality and performance!",5

It's OK to give you a ballpark number on older kids, but you end up scanning over and over for an average.Our pediatrician requested a temperature reading from a rectal thermometer for our infant which she said was most reliable. Yet, they use ear scanners in her office. I probably should have gotten one of those instead.",2
959,"My child is a spitter, so I easily go through a dozen burp cloths per day. These are a little more expensive than the Gerber cloths, but I like them a little better because they're slightly thicker and more absorbent. I use these ones in the morning, when the spit up is at its worst, then switch to Gerber in the afternoons.  :)",4

961,"We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.",2
962,"Potty training was a terrifying prospect for me, especially being out and about. At the same time, I didn't want to be stuck at home for weeks/months until my toddler was potty trained. We live quite far from &#34;town&#34; and that was another fear of mine. So I bought this more for the &#34;travel potty&#34; use than the &#34;trainer seat&#34; use. However, on our first excursion out with it, we used it both ways, and it is so useful! It's small enough that it fits easily in my 14&#34;x14&#34; wet/dry bag, with extra liners, change of bottoms, wipes, and a cloth diaper for wiping up messes. It's really easy to whip out in the very short amount of time my daughter has between &#34;I have to pee!!&#34; and actually going.Like at least one other reviewer has said, it's important to know that if you're going to use it as a potty, you need to kind of &#34;lock&#34; the legs into place by pushing them up into the seat part. Then, to fold back up, you just need to carefully pull the legs out one notch. To go from folded up to trainer seat, there's no locking into place necessary.The liners that come with it are really amazing. The absorbent pad holds most if not all of the pee my toddler releases at a time (it claims to hold 5oz) so I'm not just carrying around a bag of liquid. At the same time, $10.xx for 30 liners (when my daughter, who is still in the early stages of potty training, can pee 5 times in just a few hours) can get costly. So we've found that the small plastic garbage bags (4 gallon) are much more cost effective. (Our grocery store has a generic pack of 30 for $1.67.) If I'm really concerned about the bag of pee, I can throw some paper towels or even a cloth diaper in it. I still plan to buy the Potette Plus liners from time to time as a luxury item, or maybe if we're going on a trip where we might not be able to dispose of the bags in a timely manner. =)I've read that plastic shopping bags like from the grocery store would work well, and I could see that. But I don't know about you, but most of our plastic bags have holes in them, plus now more and more cities are going bag-less anyway, so it's nice to know the small garbage bags work, too.I've never tried any other 2-in-1 type travel potties like this, but I'm very, very happy with my purchase.",5
963,"I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.",5
964,"I keep this in the back of my car for those emergency situations where my little one can't get to a potty. So handy to have this! It has saved me several times.",5
965,"This doesn't fold up as compactly as some seats, but this isn't only for placing on top of a toilet like most are. My DD absolutely REFUSES to go on public toilets, so this has been a wonderful solution for us. And, when she is finally ready for them, this will give her the comfort of being the same thing she's used to going on. It doesn't fold up very well if you have the reusable liner on it, but the disposable ones let it collapse completely as it should. However, my DD will only use the reusable liner (the crinkly plastic of the disposable ones bug her), so I can say that if you do fold the seat with the reusable liner on it, the liner takes the abuse of the legs folding into it well without damage. (The reusable is so easy to clean that I've yet to use a disposable liner, so I don't know how well those work). Also, in potty chair formation, it is low to the ground, but this makes going &#34;#2&#34; a lot easier for the child and encourages them to make that step of potty training (or it did for my DD who wouldn't until we got this).The folding mechanism takes some getting used to, but is quick once you do. It is very important that you make sure that the legs are fully clicked into the seat before use though or it will be unstable -- properly clicked, it's fine. We've not used it as a seat on top of a toilet, so I can't speak to that much except that it's so wide when in that formation it won't worry me that the seat will shift and fall into the toilet like some seats do (shift, probably, but not fall).",5

971,"I bought this at the same time as the lady bug toy holder because I knew I did not want to use adhesive.  The suction cups work great.  Follow the directions, clean them and the wall with alcohol, and make sure you get the cups fully on the tile not bridging any grout lines and you should be fine.  It would be nice if this were included in the main product, but at least it is offered as an option and I think worth the extra few bucks.",4
972,"This is a great crib protector pad. (Pee pad)  It is flat which makes it easier to change.  The materials are also healthier than any other waterproof crib pad I have found.  I have a non-waterproof crib mattress so just in case, I have the fitted one and then this flat one on top of that.  I keep the fitted one on at all times and I only change the flat one.  I have 2 flat ones, one to use and one to wash.  We haven't had any leaks so the fitted one is still clean.  It does take a while to dry but that doesn't bother me.  I just put it on low heat and set my dryer for 50 minutes.  A longer drying time is well worth the benefits of having healthier bedding materials. Use low heat to make sure you don't damage the waterproof membrane.",5
973,"These were great and just what I had been looking for.  I've seen it since in stores for similar price but I was many, many months pregnant at the time I bought.  Much more convenient to order from Amazon. I was able to get 2 molds from it. Highly recommend.",5
974,"Used these when my baby was 2 weeks old. Very easy to work with, and they turned out great. Definitely recommend!",5
975,"I have to keep buying new ones because the wires are very sensitive to toddler wear. But this is the biggest bang for your buck! They work fantastic, sensitive, but very reliable.",5
976,"It is good in the sense my daughter can hold it with her hands and she feels happy that she can do it, she is not able to put it in her mouth : it is too big....it keeps rolling away so connected it to the links I bought and hang it from her jungle gym for her to hold or bat....",3
977,"Fit his cups perfectly and helped save me money since he likes to chew on them.",5
978,"I would highly recommend these bottles.  They work great and do not leak.  Have been very pleased with them.  Will be getting more if these ever stop working.",5
979,"These bottles do come with extra parts that suck to wash but they're great bottles.",5
980,"We love these, and so does our little one.  They seem to work very well in preventing gas and tummy troubles...though some of that could be that our baby has a very chill, happy temprament.  I use them to store breastmilk in the fridge as well, and have had no troubles.  They do leak if overfilled, but the line is marked on the bottle so that can be avoided. The ounce markers can be a bit difficult to see as they are clear and raised only.  They also leak if they tip over, which is sad if its expressed breast milk...but that's life!",5
981,"My daughter and I did extensive research  on what type bottle to use for her new baby - especially as she was nursing and needed to get baby on bottle (pumped breastmilk) before heading back to work.  These bottles have worked perfectly.  She tried the bottles and nipples that came with her Medela Breast Pump but they allowed baby to drink too fast and she had some choking issues.  We did more research and then decided to try the Dr. Brown's 4 oz. bottles first (as she was not eating too much at the time).  The nipples that came with that system were Level 1 and she also seemed to eat too fast, even though less choking.  We read a review here at Amazon.com mentioning the Preemie nipples, so we bought and began using those.  Worked perfectly.  Baby had to eat slower, more sucking needed, seemed more like breastfeeding.We have now upgraded to the 8 oz. bottles as &#34;our&#34; 4 monther + 15 pounder, is doing fantastic and needs more at her feedings than the 4 ounce bottles allow (don't have to refill during feeding).  BTW I babysit her every day while daughter at work so I have first hand experience with these bottles.We do burp her after 4 ounces and try to get a 10 minute break between the first and 2nd 4 ounces (total 8 ounce per feeding) and this works well - most of the time!  Have kept the preemie nipple as she still breastfeeds when mamma not at work.No gas, no colic, no choking.Hope this helps and they work out for your baby too.",5
982,"I tried Avent and Tommee Tippee bottles for my little one and although he wasn't picky we didn't care for them for various reasons.  Dr. Brown's shape of the bottle and nipple ended up being our favorite.  The longer bottle makes it easier to use your chin to hold the bottle briefly if you need to use your feeding hand to grab something real quick and the skinnier shape allows you to store the bottles in a diaper bag easier (I use a backpack for a diaper bag and the bottles fit nicer in the water bottle holder than the thicker bottles).  I originally avoided these bottles because of the skinny nipple since I was planning on breastfeeding and I was afraid of nipple confusion but nursing didn't work out for us so I gave these nipples a try after the Tommee Tippee bottles had milk leaking out of my son's mouth like a sieve and I was pleasantly surprised with the seal my son got on these nipples.  They rarely leak.  My only complaint is that the markings are very faint on the bottle and we've had to take a permanent marker to the oz. lines so that we can  see where to fill the bottle to.  If they could add color to the markings it would make it so much easier in low light and for older nannies' eyes!",4
983,"i needed spare parts for the freestyle. this is useful because it was impractical to use just the two sets that came with the pump. now i have extra to use.",4
984,"These work very well! and very quick. you only need a few drops count to two and you get your results! Sucks that you only get a few for how much they cost though.",5
985,"I purchased this tether based on the reviews and needing to try something after my two year old daughter bolted off in a parking lot.  She did seem to prefer the tether over holding hands, at least initially.  In addition, it seem to be comfortable on her wrist.  However, there is no give to the tether, so it did cause her to fall down a few times.  I have stopped using it as she is doing better at holding hands (at least when she is not tired/fussy), and I have ordered a carrier for the other times.  Beware:  You will get a lot of looks using a tether.",3
986,"I realize that the spoons are for babies but you can really take just a drop of food out of the can.. if to take into account that it;;s not easy to make the baby wish open his mouth,, it will take ages to feed him. The silicone is of nice bright colors, but the metal looks so cheap, though it's washed pretty well in dishwasher.. Actually- they just cost their money. Good for their price.",3
987,"My daughter used to get diaper rash from disposable swim diapers.  Also, the cost ends up being high per diaper for disposables.  This is a great solution- washable, breathable- no more diaper rash and a money saver!  i also love the fish pattern.  I only wish they had an XL Size.  This is up to 30 lbs.  My 21 month old is now 30+ pounds and this is getting a bit tight.",5
988,"Fantastic product, works as specified. I keep a couple of these in the diaper bag for impromptu meals out with baby and they are invaluable.",5
989,"Can only get small particles of food, easy and effortless, but at the bottom of the cleaning is not very convenient, use loose screw has some three months",4
990,"This was very cute!  The price was great too.  Comes with a remote and plays piano music as it rotates around.  I would buy again!",5
991,"I love the remote option.  It has nice options on music and it doesn't take up too much space over the crib.  My 4 year old loves it, too.",5
992,"This is one of the best purchase we have made by far. The first couple of weeks I was able to eat in peace because of this! My baby is 6 months now and he still enjoys it. He doesn't love it as much right now as he did before because he is occupied with other things ie. rolling around in his crib but when he was younger he loved it so much he would look at it for an hour and smile!",5
993,"The baby loves it and the music does put her to sleep!  The movable characters are an added bonus, but the music is meh...not that great, could use a better line up and not so short and repetitive.  Only 4 choices and nothing I would really want myself.  I can say I would not buy it again only based on that, but otherwise the baby does like it.",4
994,"They are a large size and are much easier to change rather then the crib sheet each time. Very nice, hold their shape after washing and drying.",5
995,"scissors were too big and bulky, was afraid to cut the baby accidentally. the blades became dull after some use. bought a different kind with shorter blades that i am very happy with . I cannot comment on the nail clippers because I do not use them on my baby. however, the nail files are useful because it makes the nails smoother which helps prevent baby from leaving scratch marks on her face.",2
996,"I had high hopes for this one. I thought the 5 corners would be great for baby to chew on! But, they aren't! The diameter is way to large and the baby gets super upset that it dies not fit in his mouth. We have 2 toys that make the baby cry. And this is one of them. Eek never let it get anywhere near the baby! Unless we want to hear havoc.",1
997,"Honestly my son uses this more as a bath toy than I was every able to use it as a brush.  We still use the one he came home with from the hospital.  To be fair I couldn't really find anything else out there that was much better.",1
998,"I love these toothbrushes. From gums, to two almost-teeth, to full blown 5-toothed mouth, my son has used each one of these toothbrushes. I really like them. The only thing that I dont like is the Holder. I wish it had a suction cup. it just balances and rests on the shelf. Best part is the finger toothbrush. The bristles are all so soft and long so you can get into those hard to reach places.",5
999,"We love this! It is quite expensive but really soft, warm, and breathable, and you don't have to worry about suffocation etc. like with a blanket. Our baby sleeps in it every night. It works for summer (with the ac on) and winter. Use baby shampoo instead of detergent to wash. (The wool seems to be resistant to stains and smells, so we have had to wash this less than I would have thought.)",5
1000,"Satiny smooth on one side and minky soft on the other. Just what I was looking for! Not as thick as my daughter's Happy Blankie, but it's a great, cheaper backup.",5
1001,"I wanted something that he could gnaw/chew on while he was on his tummy...that would stand off the ground.  This fit the bill.",4
1002,"My son loves that it is scented, I think it reminds him of his paci from the NICU.  He popped the little nub into his mouth and started sucking, I figured he would chew on it...  He has squeaked it a few times and the look on his face is priceless.  He is a bit over 6 months old (he was a preemie) and has 2 teeth trying to erupt.  He seems to like this so far",5
1003,"My son has used this as a water bottle (with a flat cap we purchased separately) in his lunch box for two years now, and it is still going strong.  He is only 8 years old, and so 4 ounces of water is plenty for him during his short 30 minute lunch, and it fits nicely in his lunch bag along with a bento container.We give it a rinse daily and run it through the dishwasher weekly; it would probably need washed well daily if anything other than water was stored in it.  So far, there have been no leaks, and the bottle is easy for little hands to open.  The glass container offers me peace-of-mind, and I appreciate that the components are NOT made in China (though it would be nice if it was 100% made in USA).",5
1004,"I wasn't crazy about the nipples because they are too small. (comparable to the dr. browns or evenflo). I like a more wide mouth nipple but I use these to pump into (they attach to my medela pump) and i bought the Caps that the company sells and they are very convienent.",5
1005,"I love the glass bottle, but there really is no venting with this bottle. I bought the Dr. Browns narrow plastic bottle and the internal venting system fits perfectly in this glass bottle... But that adds an extra $6 to total cost of this bottle. I only bought 1 and won't buy any more. Avent glass is vented, cheaper & less parts to clean.",3
1006,"My 5 month old has been into &#34;links&#34; now for about 3 months.  She loves them.  Connected to each other, on their own, it doesn't matter.  They fit in her little hands and she can grab them.  Her new favorite game is pulling them off of whatever they're attached to and waving them around!  I have bought 4 packs of links at this point and i could still say we could use more.One of the things I used one pack for was to put a link in every loop on the gym that we got her.  I did this because getting toys into the loops while we were playing was a PAIN and caused a delay that really wasn't fun.  I grabbed a pack of links, put one in each loop and voila!  2 second toy changes!",5
1007,"many of these!  Great for hooking a lot of toys to the car seat, the crib, etc!  The links are eve fun just by themselves!",5
1008,"These interlocking rings make a fine toy all by themselves.  However their ability to interlock with other toys and baby equipment is what makes them great.  Four or five of them interlocked with one end linked onto a high-chard and the other linked to a favorite toy help limit the task of picking up toys off the floor.  And my nine-month old loves the also as individual teething rings.  A simple but effective toy.",5
1009,"These are awesome in that you can use them with all of the other toys baby has to put them in arms reach, attach so they don't hit the ground, attach multiple toys together so less likely to lose, etc. We have them all over the house for multiple uses. I love the colors and my daughter loves the different textures to chew on.",5
1010,"Not only does my son love chewing on these by themselves, they are perfect for hooking his toys onto his stroller, or my wrap, or his carseat, or anything. These are a must have for parents of wee ones!",5
1011,"There are several different molds uses to make the rings. My little girl likes them, they can form a chain to hold toys to things.",5
1012,"I've got these hanging everywhere. I use them to attach toys to bouncer, swing, car seat, jumperoo, mama's clothing, crib rails, baby carrier, etc. Good deal. Colorful & many different textures. Baby & mama are happy. Even used 3 in a pinch as a hair claw!",5
1013,"Our baby loves these links...for the price, there is no toy that makes her happier. She likes to hold them and chew on them, and they are excellent for attaching toys all over the house. We now have three sets.",5
1014,"I love the aden + anais products.  The muslin is a great material, however, it compares nothing to the bamboo blankets that is also available.",4
1015,"I adore this blanket. Perfect for little ones to play on and big enough for an adult to use as a throw. Super-soft, thick, WONDERFUL. This is the perfect baby gift!!!",5
1016,"I have yet to purchase a produce from aden + anais that I don't love. I use all of their products on a daily basis. This is really a nice size. It's large enough to grow with my infant for a few years. It's soft and gets softer with each wash. I also really love that they have the same pattern in each product line. I have the jungle jam pattern in this blanket, burpy bibs and swaddling blankets. Great, great product. Not a cheap feeling blanket, either. It's pretty thick and feels very well made",5
1017,"We got the 'Star Light' BLUE one (for some reason I don't see the blue one anymore; had bought 8 months back) for our son and I love it! It is soft, breathable and heavy enough to help baby sleep better. The blanket is warm yet does not let the baby overheat. And it is large enough so can be used for many years. Fantastic product! Worth the price!",5
1018,"I use this all the time and it a very nice pacifier holder. The material is silky smooth and holds up to washing very well.worth my money",5
1019,"Cute and stylish - wish there was an organic option and that they were a tad shorter. Not our favorite.",4
1020,"I liked this, but as my son started to grab and tug, this was really easy to pull off.  I prefer the Ulubulu brand clips, because they're a firmer hold.",4
1021,"Great product.  Cleans easily and made in many versatile patterns/designs.  We have about 8 different ones.  Love these clips the best put of all brands.",5
1022,"We love these Paci holders. We have two and used them every day- one in the car and one on the stroller.",5
1023,"...but my baby constantly gets his hands up under the strap and rips his pacifier from his mouth abruptly, immediately inducing a crying fit and requiring me to go stick it back in his mouth even more often.  Maybe he'll grow out of it.  At least the pacifier isn't falling on the floor, though.",5
1024,"It's a perfectly fine bed.  No complaints, nothing above and beyond the expectation.  The rails are starting to loosen a bit after a year's use, but that might be because my daughter likes to sleep right up against it.",4
1025,"It stopped working after 3 days sitting on a shelf. Too bulky for a toddler arm, could never get my daughter to use it Save your money.",1
1026,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. I ordered this for my daughter before she was born and started filling it out. I love all the different things that she'll be able to look back at when she's older, for example the price of gas and milk and what was popular when she was born such as tv shows, books and musicians. I've kept up with the other information since she was born and plan to do so until she is 5. I can't wait to share this with her when she is old enough. I would recommend this for anyone having children and as a shower gift for expectant mothers.",5
1027,"I love all of the Angle Dear products.  I have bought several things and these hold up so well.  My son LOVED them and they are now in storage ready for the next one.  They were washed several times and still so soft and cute.  Highly recommend all their products.",5
1028,"I have bought my 10 month old son practically EVERY sippy cup on the market. He refuses to drink out of them and finds them funner to play with. He has been interested in trying to drink out of our cups for some time, but they require him to tilt his head all the way back. The first time he tried the Doidy Cup, it was a success. The look on his face said it all. He was so proud that he had drank like a big boy and none had spilled on him. I do have to hold it for him but with practice I think that he will so be doing it on his own. I would recommend this to every single parent.",5
1029,"The only pacifier my son would take.  It is excellent, durable, and washes well also.  We started with the 0-6 months and have been updating to the other sizes as he grew.  Can't say enough good things about these.  Well worth the price.",5
1030,"My got these for my daughter when she was about 9 months old and she has loved playing with them for the past 6 months.  I think the size is perfect.  I do agree, however, that the finish is a little rough.  They aren't going to do any damage or anything (scratches, splinters), but I was hoping they would have a nice smooth finish, like the Haba toys, for example.",4
1031,"our 12 month old suddenly hated baths one day.....took us three baths with her squirming and trying to escape the bathtub before we pinpointed that she didn't want the water in her face when we washed her hair anymore and was freaking out....found this splashguard here on amazon....LOVE IT! our 14 month old now enjoys bathtime again AND having her hair washed....this this is a lifesaver.....thanks to whomever created it!",5
1032,"I'm on my third kid and 5th diaper pail.  My fourth pail was a Diaper Genie Elite that worked great until my son shoved his hand into the inside of the pail and broke a piece of it, and it no longer opened with the foot pedal.  I replaced it with the same pail (Diaper Genie Elite), and this one doesn't seem to have the same odor protection as my last one.  No idea why.  I hate that you have to buy the bags for this (unless you do a hack, which I've heard does not offer the same odor protection at all).  I used a Diaper Champ for a few years and this is far better.  It's easy to use, easy to change, seems to fill up pretty quickly because the bags are so narrow, but from my experience, this is the best pail to keep stink out of your nursery, and messes contained to ONLY the plastic diaper pail lining.  The others have a plastic &#34;pass through&#34; that the diaper touches before going in to plastic, which obviously gets dirty after some poop-splosion clean up jobs.  And Costco now carries the refill bags for less money than Amazon ;)",4
1033,"My husband and I had agreed not to use any sort of diaper pale and that we would take all the diapers outside  (especially since we have a very curious young lab).  We recieved this as a baby shower gift and decided what the heck - lets try it!  Now this is a nice thing to have so close to the babys changing table and its great for pee diapers BUT we have found it is not 'air tight' when it comes to poopy diapers.  My baby goes pee A LOT and is very dramatic about sitting in a pee diaper for even 5 secods so we go through a lot of diapers.  We find ourselves emptying this almost every day but we have learned out lesson and we take the poopy diapers straight out.  I dont look forward to buying all the refills - either.  I think the liner/refills should be scented and that may make the product more enticing but I guess its more of a convenient thing.  Overall, Im glad we use it!",4
1034,"You'll read many reviews claiming that this is junk because it doesn't completely block 500% of all odors ever to have been known to man...but come on, what on our entire planet can completely block the odors of 25 soiled diapers collected in one compact bin within your home??? The answer is: nothing.What this DOES do is make disposal of a soiled diaper quick and easy. Just step on the pedal, drop it in, take your foot off the pedal. I had the Munchkin Diaper Pail first, and while I thought it was quite good, the design required the user to open the lid with a hand, push the diaper through an opening into the bag, and push the lid closed. It worked well. However, when the bag would start getting full, closing the lid was met with resistance and I always thought I would break the gears inside that twist the bag shut.The Muchkin was better at odor blocking, until bag changing time.The Diaper Genie is better at odor blocking while changing bags (my wife was clever enough to make her knot in the bag THEN cut it...I was not) but isn't quite as good the rest of the time.There are various refill brands, all of which tote odor protection/blocking, but none really block all of the odors. It's pretty simple to just put some baking soda disks in the bottom of this thing and/or sprinkle a little on top of each diaper after dropping it in the top, before letting off the pedal.Pros:+Taller than Munchkin Diaper Pail, so easier to throw away diapers+One hand and one foot operation+Just drop the diaper, no need to push it through an opening having to feel &#34;the squish&#34;+Quieter operation than Munchkin Diaper Pail due to absence of gear-driven bag twisting mechanism (great for disposing of a diaper after baby has already fallen back to sleep!)Cons:-Refills are very expensive, but THIS http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXH2M2W/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 is a great substitute that works well and is much cheaper.-Bag changes aren't as quick & easy as the Munchkin Diaper PailOverall, we like this one better than the Munchkin Diaper Pail due to the ease of use when disposing of a soiled diaper, especially when you're trying to be quiet.",4
1035,"My son loves this toy, especially the rings.  He brings them wherever he goes.  My only problem with it is that in the tub, they fill with water, and when he throws them out of the tub, they make a huge watery mess.  Probably would have been better sealed up.  Oh well.",4
1036,"I like that these are small and light.  They attach to the Medela pump-in-style which makes pumping at work and feeding the following day easier.  My baby hasn't had trouble with the nipple.  The bottles don't leak and clean easily in the dishwasher or by hand.My husband likes the different colors too because it helps color code which bottle to serve first.",5
1037,"I bought this Wubbanub for my friend who is expecting a boy. I wanted a &#34;different&#34; color and design from the usual brown, orange or baby blue. This dragon is adorable.",5
1038,"Great fabric, tons of pockets, very large but not heavy. Changing pad is handy - plenty of inside mesh pokets and happy to tote around",5
1039,"I actually ended up returning this pattern but have since purchased this same bag in plain black and silver. My daily diaper bag is a Ju Ju Be Better Be, which I adore! I was looking for a bag that I can use with my son for longer days out or weekends away and this is perfect. Because it is Ju Ju Be I am confident that when the time comes for baby 2, this will make a great daily bag for both kids. Love the mommy pocket and gusseted sides. Sooo well designed and such high quality. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this brand. Interior pockets are great sizes and the insulated exterior bottle pockets actually do work! Padded change pad is a pretty decent size. Highly recommend.",5
1040,"Pros: Inside has several mesh (see thru) pockets with elastic at the top. The sides have large pockets that close with magnet flaps. The front flap has an organization area with more pockets. One for sunglasses and one that fits passports perfectly (plus others). The bag opens very wide to see all that is inside. The changing pad is nice and big. Very large bag for weekend trips. The hardware seems to be of good quality.Cons: handles seem kinda chinsy. The front flap awkwardly bulges out from the rest of the bag when the bag is full. The whole thing takes on a somewhat awkward bulky shape when it is very full.  The bag is too big for daily use.",4
1041,"I wanted an organic lovey for my baby. This is very soft and cute. It's a little smaller than I imagined it would be, but will be great for her to hold onto/play with early on. No complaints.",5
1042,"This is an ok bottle warmer. There's no timer so it's very easy to burn bottle. I've ruined a couple bottles also sometimes it takes longer than 4 minutes to heat bottle. Still a lot easier than microwaving a bowl of water for 3 minutes then letting bottle sit in bowl for another 4 minutes so it still saves time.",4
1043,"Extremely useful. Heats milk fast, in just a couple of minutes. Far better than the stove. Unsure if it has any safety feature to turn itself of though, I leave it on by accident often.",5
1044,"Bottle warmers are extremely important for my household. We make 2-3 bottles at a time and stick them in the fridge to have ready for my daughter. We have been through a few bottle warmers and came across this one. It was one of the most expensive of the 3 but knew we would spend good money if it was a good quality warmer.  My husband immediately did not like it because you have to fill water up and check to see if it is always full every time you use the warmer.  I personally do not mind it because it is really easy to fill since you just pour it in w/o much work.  The bottle warms up fast but if you use Dr. Brown bottles it never warms the top half of the bottle. We use both Dr. Brown & Avent.  Even w/ Avent bottles we have to warm is 2x to get it warm enough for my daughter to drink w/o problems.My biggest complaint is the switch! They have it on the bottom back of the warmer and it is hard to get to sometimes on the counter. I get they wanted to hide the switch b/c, hey who wants to see the switch on the front but it is inconvenient to have the switch on the bag especially since the switch is side to side. It's hard to turn on and off w/ one hand.  I also wish it would turn off by itself. If you do not turn off the switch it warms up, turns &#34;off&#34; just  but goes back on. The only want to turn off the warmer completely is hit the switch back to off. Sometimes when we get up at 3 am w/ my daughter and are not &#34;all there&#34; b/c of lack of sleep  we accidentally leave the warmer on and not hit the switch and it stays on for hours and hours.I give the bottle 4 stars but my husband would give it just 2.",3
1045,"This is an pretty good bottle warmer. However, there's no alarm to tell you that the milk is ready so it's very easy to burn bottle. I used this with many different types of bottles (e.g., Advent, Playtex, Dr. Brown. etc..) and it works for all of them.I would prefer the Dr Brown warmer below which has certainly more featureshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LLG2W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0035LLG2W&linkCode;=as2&tag;=justckem-20",4
1046,"Get one that has a &#34;the milk it ready&#34; sound. You will thank me later. We overheat milk way to often in this. Functions well otherwise.",3
1047,"This is the second bottle warmer we have used... It is a bit slower than the evaporating warmer we had before, but it works as described. FYI it takes about 8 minutes for 6 ounces of milk to warm out of the fridge...",4
1048,"Let me just say that this is a must have for potty training toddlers. My 22 month old daughter is now being sent to and from school (daycare) in just panties and I worried that she might have an accident in the 15 minutes it took us to get home. And yup, accidents happen. The pad had a waterproof lining underneath to protect your carseat! Everyone know what a PAIN IN THE BUTT it can be to remove the carseat cover to wash it, but this Piddlepad saves you from doing just that.Now I cant review on poopy blowouts as she has never had one (even with a diaper). The back of the pad is far up enough above the lumbar that I am sure it would withstand a blow out.The material is &#34;velvety&#34; and might be a bit hot during the warmer months. And as shown in the picture, the sides kinda fold in a way that keep the pad from moving around but it is easily removable  when needed.I only purchased one of these, but I am going to have to buy another for my other car.",5
1049,"It's easy to put in and take out for cleaning, and it definitely keeps liquids from soaking through. Two caveats though: 1) a toddler/child who climbs into the seat will end up shifting around the pad or bunching it up because, aside from the buckle threaded through it, there's nothing actually keeping it in place; 2) if there is liquid in/on it, you should soak up any free-flowing liquid before even thinking of moving it (it doesn't soak up much as much as it just holds the liquid).However, it's comfy for the child, it's well made, washes well, and it does what it's supposed to do. BUT, the design should include some way to let a kid climb into the seat without it shifting around so easily instead of creating a situation where the parent has to haul the child upwards/out to rearrange it at least half the time. It makes the whole process of getting kids in the car that much longer and stressful... I only dock it one star because the arranging issue can be avoided by just placing the child in the seat yourself. Tiresome and annoying (especially with more than one kid), but doable.",4
1050,"These are a perfect solution to the sprayer that I don't particularly care to use. These fit my 1.5 year olds great. I used these even when they were smaller, just folded the sides a bit before putting on the diaper.",5
1051,"Still only using cloth diapers at home on the weekend, so I have less experience than some.  I do like this product, allowed me to re-use my pocket diaper cover after a pee-pee and kept them cleaner after a poo-poo.  Was able to keep them in an old wipes container, which made them easy to grab when changing.",4
1052,"I bought this to go with my Better Be diaper bag, and it is perfect. My first diaper bag was a Kalencom, and it came with a matching pouch and a bottle bag. I loved both. When I decided to buy a Better Be to downsize my bag, I was worried about having to purchase a separate matching pouch to put diapers in. I'm so happy that I discovered Ju Ju Be since they have lots of coordinating items. This wristlet is perfect for storing diapers and wipes. Plus, it has an interior zippered pocket that I put plastic bags in to discard messy diapers. I am able to fit size 4 diapers in it without a problem, and I can tell that there's plenty of room for more. I also like that the wristlet strap can be snapped onto the same side so that you can a circle strap. I can hang the bag easily on changing tables, AND better yet, it is long enough that I can have it on my wrist while I'm doing a change, and it doesn't get in the way. It prevents me from having to set my bag on the changing table if it isn't the cleanest.",5
1053,"Saw lots of youtube reviews that showed this bag being used purely for diapering, and wow, what a great idea!! I keep this bag stuffed with diapering supplies in my main diaper bag and when I need to change my son, I grab this small bag and the change pad. I always hated dragging the big diaper bag in with me, so this is perfect not to mention more sanitary! I usually unzip it and hang it up on the back of the door, meaning I usually never have to place it down on a less than clean change table. However, if I do have to put it down and I think it's a bit icky, in the washing machine it goes! Perfect for a clean freak and super organized mom like myself. I think they call it a type a personality?? Get one, you'll love it!",5
1054,"Pros:perfect size for any size diapers and wipesHas a little side pocket for smaller itemsHardware seems pretty sturdyCons:Fabric quality seems poorOverall structure seems poorly designed- shape is sort of irregular.Overpriced for what it is.",2
1055,"This paci pod looks great and easily holds two pacifiers. I have gumdrop pacifiers in there and it could easily hold three. I believe this would work with any pacifier. The quality is top notch.",5
1056,"The other holder I had was the Nuby Paci Cradle and it kept falling off the car seat and stroller so we finally lost that one and ordered this one which I felt was a little pricey but had great reviews. I knew it would never fall off since it has a clasp to attach it to anything...stroller, diaper bag, car seat, etc.  Holds two Avent Soothie pacifiers very well with straps on the inside so they don't fall out when you unzip the holder.  (We did eventually find the Nuby Paci Cradle and leave it attached to our stroller but hardly ever use it).  Great product and worth the $$.",5
1057,"I did realize the color may vary, but if there is no option for color options, at least don't send pink glasses!  I was disappointed when I opened the box to find pink for my son.  I'm not returning them, but there really needs to either be a color option or no pink glasses sent out.",3
1058,"The glasses my 3 year olds had been resisting wearing were those Rex-spex kind with the straps all around their heads. They hated them. We got these and suddenly they ask to wear their sunglasses, especially the one who had been most resistant before. They also have been through the wringer (3 yo boy twins) and they've been going strong for three months. Great product.",5
1059,"This was more of an impulse purchase for my almost two year old daughter.  I am so glad I purchased them.  She had no difficulty putting them on, and uses them regularly.  She cries when the sun is in her eyes (riding in car or stroller).  However, when she has her sunglasses, she puts them on and there are no more tears.  They are a nice flexible plastic.  The glasses have been dropped and seem no worse for the wear.  The only complaint as others have mentioned is that you cannot pick your color.  I ended up with blue which would not have been my preference for a little girl.  I would have liked pink or yellow.  I would probably purchase another pair if I could pick the color but do not want to end up with two blue sunglasses.",5
1060,"I got these for my two year old and he liked the color but they were just too small. He bent them every sort of way imaginable but they withstood the abuse, so if they fit better they would have been perfect. He does have a big dome, so they would probably fit most 2-3 year olds.",3
1061,"We have a 3 year old and 7 month old twins. After buying about 5 single strollers for our daughter when she was a baby we learned our lesson for our twins. We wanted lightweight, easy, and portable.I understand new parents wanting the really expensive and trendy strollers, and what is important in a stroller is different to everyone; however, for us those big expensive strollers were a waste.I bought this before our twins were born, and put it together pregnant in about 15 minutes. The canopy wasn't in the correct position for attachment. I had to wind both sides around and fittle with it a little bit until it was in the correct position to attach. I think this is done for shipping reasons though so it fits in the box correctly. Anyways, the things I like about this stroller are:--light weight and folds up compact--the seats recline--although it is close, it fits fine through most standard doorways (especially anywhere that is handicap accessible)--can close with the side bags and canopies attached--pushes and maneuvers very easily--sturdy construction--it has a cup holderThe things we did to enhance this stroller are:--we purchased 2 of the jeep mesh storage bags that hang off the back handles so we have plenty of storage (it folds fine with them attached)--we purchased the summer infant Rayshade which gives full sun blockage and protection.  This fits over the existing canopies, and has to be attached and detached with each use (however it takes about 45 seconds to attach and it folds up into a small disc which we store in one of the jeep mesh bags attached to the stroller).--we purchased a universal (dream in me segboard) riding board for our 3 year old. It attaches behind one of the seats off the back of the stroller so she can ride on it when she doesn't want to walk, or she can ride on it with her back facing the stroller seat. This is awesome, because we never have to bring more than this 1 stroller with us for all 3 kids.All in all, this stroller has already been worth it's weight in gold. We get compliments and inquiries everywhere we go about our setup. It is extremely convenient. I definitely do not envy the parents we pass pushing those big, bulky expensive strollers (sometimes their pushing 2 if they have several little ones). We are going to Disney in September and I know this stroller will be easy and convenient there as well.",5
1062,"So cheap, and still does the job. Stank of plastic, but the smell was soon gone.",4
1063,"Excellent, high quality product. My toddler and pre toddler love it. I had to buy two. They love to look up at the stars as they fall asleep. It's not so bright it keeps them awake, but bright enough like a dim night light. It automatically shuts off after 15-20 minutes. Not exactly sure.",5
1064,"I RARELY give a product a bad review.  I tend to read both the high and low reviews before a purchase and usually assume user error on most of the negative reviews.  This one really doesn't stick as folks have claimed.  I tried it several times in several locations on my new and very clean ceramic tile and it doesn't stay.  Let me be clear, it will stick for a few minutes with the frog attached, but not with any weight in it.  It slowly pulls away from the wall and falls within 5-10 mins of being installed.  I have tried reducing the weight.  It didn't work.  This is unfortunate because I love this frog pod but I am not sticking double sided tape onto brand new tiles.",1
1065,"we had the original sticky one on our tub in our old house and literally couldn't remove it when we moved so we left it there. I purchased this one a little nervous that it wouldn't be able to hold up the toys like the sticky one did, but it has worked great! have not had to re-stick it at all and its been over a month since I hung it up",5
1066,"We have bought some other brand sheets for the cribs and they fit really tight, especially after washing. The carters brand is great and the size is perfect, easy to put on the mattress. Will not buy another brand for my crib mattress",5
1067,"Baby sleeps better on these sheets. Wish the elastic on the corners was made to really gather the material. As it is there is  a lot of extra work tucking the excess corner material under.",4
1068,"This sheet has held up well. Perfect size, soft, and beautiful color. My daughter loves sleeping on it because of how soft it is.",5
1069,"Ahhhhh my son loves these velour crib sheets! So soft and cozy.  They help him to soothe and sleep longer.  I notice he doesn't sleep as well with regular cotton sheets.",5
1070,"I am really digging the plush feel of this sheet. It is so soft and smooth and gives just that little softness that is nice for babies while also keeping their bed firm as is needed for their sleep. It would be nice if companies would come out with bolder colors and more selection. I buy a lot of the green stuff because I am soooooo, so very sick of color coding my child with pink!",4
1071,"These are so soft and warm for my babies and easy to slip on and off, no matter how many times I wash and dry them, they stay soft and the same size. A lot of cotton sheets shrink and then you're wrestling them onto the mattress. Not these, they fit all the time and are so comfortable. Would recommend to everyone as the choice of sheet for baby mattress.",5
1072,"We have had these installed on all our kitchen cabinets. My husband installed them in an hour and they have now lasted over 9 months being opened and closed everyday. If I had one complaint, it would be that I wish they were a tad longer, but not enough for me to change the 5-star rating. I don't know if people are expecting these latches to magically open when you say abracadabra or something, but these get the job done for the price.",5
1073,"My favorite part about this is how soft it is! It's also the perfect thickness. My daughter is rolling around in her crib now and I can trust that she won't bonk her head or get an arm stuck. My only complaint is that the ties aren't very long. So if your crib has thicker rails it may not fit as well.",4
1074,"You can't go wrong with a classic white crib sheet (all our sheets are white - I had read that it would be easier to throw all the sheets In the wash with some bleach if they got stained).This is a soft and it was a fantastic price. It's lasted 18 months now with LOTS of use and washing and has held up great (if possible I dry outside in the sun, but other than that I haven't had to use any bleach actually).",5
1075,"my babies love this crib sheet! You may wonder, how do I know?  I know because my babies, when they go into the crib, rub their face int he soft jersey!  Also it's easy to wash and clean, is nice and stretchy, inexpensive, matches my nursery, and is warm!  I was a bit worried about the nighttimes as they are cold in the nursery, but with their warm little nighties and sleep sacks and this jersey sheet, it's very nice and cozy for the babies.",5
1076,"I ordered this to fit theSummer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Bedding. Thankfully, the sheet fits perfectly. It's very soft and washes well. I'm really happy with it overall!",5
1077,"I was not overwhelmed by the greatness of this sheet when I first bought it, but it is hard to find simple, modern crib sheets that aren't covered with characters/themes.  I purchased a couple other sheet brands as well and the Dwell one is the one that I am constantly putting back on the crib because it is sooooo much softer after many washes than the others.  It has maintained its shape/dimensions, no snags or loose threads, no fading, no staining, and it somehow resists wrinkles.  I am in year 2 with this sheet and will be purchasing only Dwell sheets for my next baby.",5
1078,"This is a very huggably soft jersey material that is a perfect fit for the Arm's Reach Ideal Co-Sleeper. It's also half the price of the official Arm's Reach one so it's a no-brainer.",5
1079,"Fits very well, nice and soft, color as expected. I really recommend it. Carter's is difficult to beat. Baby loves it.",5
1080,"These were my favorite receiving blankets.  The extra large size allowed me to use them with my daughter long after she outgrew all of the other brands I got as gifts.",5
1081,"I have been using these blankets for almost everything - throwing it on shoulder while carrying my son, using it sometimes as sheet for him to sleep on, using it as light blanket on hot days, spreading it in bath tub to keep the baby from slipping while bathing and swaddling him when he was a newborn. Love these blankets! It's very multi-purpose at a very reasonable price! Durable, looks cute and good material. Would definitely recommend.",5
1082,"Not meant for deep mattresses, but it goes over tightly and is very snug.  Looks like a Marine's bed when on, which is a good thing, but man, it's a butt to put on and take off.",3
1083,"This fit our large forward facing car seat perfectly. I followed another reviewers advice and placed the bag on the ground first then popped the seat right in. It held up on two cross country flights and being tossed around by some of the most aggressive handlers in the business. The seat was perfect, the bag was scuffed but still held up well. My husband loved the way he could change the strap configuration to carry it easier. We are both very happy with this purchase and the quality of the product.",5
1084,"this bag lasted one way of a round trip flight-on teh way back it got a huge hole.  served its purpose but if you are looking for an investment-this is NOT it.",1
1085,"I preferred spending the $14 on this instead of using a plastic bag since I know plastic bags can rip and the possibility of the car seat ripping was most likely.  The travel bag and car seat were in great condition after the flight.When I originally purchased the car seat, I was worried that the base would not fit and I would have needed to take it back.  I am glad that was not the case and the base fit with the car seat with a little extra room.",5
1086,"Used it to travel with a Britax Marathon car seat. We checked it through the airline and the car seat remained clean and unharmed. The Britax Marathon fit perfectly with extra room for blankets.",5
1087,"Used this for an international trip with my 4 year olds carseat.  This kept the seat protected and clean and was easy to carry with the handle and strap.  Great value and held up really well during 6 flights - checked with luggage every time.",5
1088,"The best in sleepsacks, wouldn't use any other kind.  I've tried others, but we always go back to HALO.  Safer than using a blanket, and the swaddle keeps them comforted and sleeping calmly.",5
1089,"its the best baby product I ever bought! not one of them but the best. easy to use. he feels so comfortable in it. in spring its all he needs while sleeping.can you make a thinner version for the summer? he's sweating when its 80.",5
1090,"As first time parents, this swaddle is extremely easy to use, and fast, which is important to soothe baby when you're not used to having a baby cry around and can be extremely unnerving. The cotton and muslin ones are great for summer since there's only 2 layers of fabric on baby compared to traditional swaddles.",5
1091,"Our twin girls were born with hip clicks and had to get ultrasounds every couple of weeks for the first few months. At first we had them tightly swaddled and then switched to this. MUCH MUCH better. Neither twin needs a harness and hip issues are gone. Not giving all the credit to this, but I'm sure it helped.",5
1092,"I've tried many of them.  This one is the best.  The velcro is very, very strong, and baby cannot escape if you swaddle him tightly.  A few notes:- Always put baby to sleep on his or her back.  Always.- Baby can easily overheat when swaddled - this fabric is thick and there several layers around baby's arms.  We use just the swaddle and a diaper - no onesie - in the summertime to keep baby cool.  For babies, too cool may be uncomfortable, but too hot is dangerous.",5
1093,"Excellent easy swaddling sack to assist those who aren't proficient at swaddling with a blanket.  This worked well when it was colder in very early spring, but the heavier material wasn't as useful as mid spring / spring / summer came on full force.",5
1094,"I prefer the swaddleme's to this swaddle. My daughter got out of this swaddle pretty easily. Also the fabric is pretty thick.",3
1095,"I started using this when my 25 monther started breaking out of the miracle blanket. His arms lasted one night in the swaddle portion. Ended up having to stop using the swaddle portion and just wrap it around his body; use this just as a sleep sack now",4
1096,"I have a fleece version of this and wanted a cotton one for summer- but this shrunk to almost 3/4th it's original size :(",1
1097,"The material is so thin that my baby would wrestle his way out of it and cry. After a couple washes, it would stretch out too. Much more prefer the flannel ones. They are snug, keep baby in and don't stretch over time. This was a waste of money for me. BUY THE FLANNEL ONES LIKE THIS INSTEAD. The halo flannels are incredible and would recommend those as number one choice for swaddles.",3
1098,"was good to keep baby warm without using a blanket. however, the velcro doesn't hold well after being washed, it is wrinkly after multiple washes.",4
1099,"Our hospital gives these out as patient gifts when you have a baby.  I had gotten a ton of the Summer wraps but tried one once and hated them, all floppy and worthless.  We tried our free SleepSack and loved it immediately and my husband went to the store and bought three more.  I like that there are fleece ones and cotton ones for various seasons. I love that the zipper zips from the top down so the tallywhacker isn't bothering my baby's chin.  This is also useful for nighttime diaper changes as depending on the outfit underneath it's possible to change a diaper without undoing the swaddle!  The only complaint I have is that the Velcro sticks to things in the washer and dryer and the part that the velcro sticks to doesn't go far enough around the back - when I secure the Velcro the last three or four inches of fabric don't stick to the back and the end just flops around sticks to stuff.  We don't swaddle with arms-in so maybe that's the reason?",4
1100,"The take and toss brand is such a decent quality for such a low price and I love it! Can't beat that.",5

1102,"My daughter is 16 months.  About a month ago, she seems no longer want to sit at her high chair.  We bought this so she can eat with us at the dinning room table.  So far she is doing well.  She likes to be a big girl and eating regular meal with us.  This booster seems comfortable and safe.",5
1103,"This is very useful for keeping seats clean, I have them on the backs of seats so my daughter doesn't make the upholstery dirty, have been useful and sturdy so far.",4
1104,"My LO LOVES this toy - she loves the tinkling sound it makes as well as the crunchy bug at the end.  She even likes to chew on the plastic.  All in all, a surprisingly fun toy (we actually got one as a gift, and she loved it so much, we bought another!).",5
1105,"This is great for keeping the toys attached to the stroller/ chair/ carseat/ etc. so nice to keep the toys off the floor!",5
1106,"This basically fits all our toys and is long enough where it isn't frustrating for my daughter if she wants to grab and pull on something. a pure cheap necessity for all parents.",5
1107,"Great product! I use this a lot in restaurants or in the stroller. Works as it should, keeps the toy from hitting the ground. It is just the right length - not too long, not too short. Snaps hold up to pulling and tossing of toys, and baby hasn't figured out how to pull it apart yet!",5
1108,"Avoid having your baby loosing toys from stroler. good product for a fair price. The color options are nice, too.",5
1109,"One of the best inventions ever for a parent. These can be attached to any toys any size and to anything !! Babies love to throw toys so this takes the worry out of grocery shopping, eating out and the highchair....buying more. I am not worred about her dropping her toys on the ground anymore.",5
1110,"I know that this is promoted as a jogging accessory for strollers, however these come in handy for much more than just jogging, but I'll start with the jogging first. I have never personally jogged with a stroller before. My last stroller was a horrendous pain, but having just received a new jogging stroller and having acquired a new hobby of taking daily walks, I'm super excited to test these out. I know bored little babies can throw a righteous fit, or as one of their newly acquired games they will throw their toys and expect you to pick them up. Not when mom is busy exercising, now baby can throw to their hearts content but the toy isn't going anywhere.These are really durable and I don't foresee baby pulling these off of the stroller at all. Very secure, as the name depicts. I also will be using these on the car seat, on the high chair and to click toys together so they're not lost when we're out and about. Nothing worse than losing their favorite baby toy. These also come in a wide array of colors and are very affordable, so stock up!Reviewed by Jackie for New Age Mama. Complimentary product received.",5

1114,"I finally broke down and bought a learning tower when my son refused to let me cook unless he could see what I was doing. What a fantastic item! It is bulky, but we have a very large, open kitchen. I like the dark cherry color, but it doesn't match my kitchen as well as I was hoping. It is darker than our cabinets and table. Now that I know it doesn't match, I wish I would have bought one of the colors instead (blue, green, or red). Regardless, it is a well-built piece, so it doesn't bother me. My son is only 18 mos, and he quickly figured out how to get in and out of the tower without assistance. My 4 year old niece is also a fan. I definitely see us using this for many years.I did a lot of research before deciding to buy the learning tower over similar products. My two biggest reasons for paying the extra money to get the learing tower were that (1) it is large enough for 2 kids to stand in it at the same time and (2) it felt much sturdier than some of the collapsible versions. I highly recommend this product if you have a big kitchen. Your child will love &#34;cooking&#34; alongside you every evening.",5
1115,"I love this product.  Very sturdy, provides much needed hands free time while in the kitchen.  18  month old loves that he can stand and watch or &#34;participate&#34; in the action. Would definitely recommend!",5

1119,"I hate to be the only person who writes a poor review, but unfortunately, this mattress didn't work for my Toddler.  His two older sisters have full twins size air mattresses, and this air mattress is much smaller and lower to the ground. My Toddler was worried about being so low to the ground while sleeping, and if we all lined up, he was the lowest.  He has never actually slept in it, even though we've owned it for more than a year and a half, and we take it everywhere and blow it up.  I think the quality is great, the design is great &#8211; I love that a crib mattress fits the bed, I love that the sides are high so that  a Toddler cannot easily roll out, and I like that I comes with it's own pump.  I just wish someone in my house would use it.",4

It is not too big for packing and just the right size for our 3 year old who is 33 inches tall.  There is/was a strong chemical smell to the product, but this has dissipated a good deal since first blowing it up.  I just wish I could find a similar item that was American made and PVC free.",4

And you can't just use the inner or outer part separately, since the inner one has holes that'll leak milk and the outer one has nipple collapse issues.The brush isn't that great of quality, but it's nice that they include one. Basically it's good for storage for me and that's it. Your baby might have better luck, but mine sure had a bad experience.",2
1135,"The 2 most important things for me were reducing air swallowed and easy transition between breast and bottle. I tried Adiri and Avent bottles, but the both, even with slowest flow nipples, choked my son with too much milk. With the Breast flow he controls how much or how little he gets in his mouth. Also my son would grasp the tip of my nipple instead of my whole areola following use of either the Avent or the Adiri...ouch, which he does not do with the Breast flow bottles! The Avent would be my second choice, they are a slower flow than the Adiri and because the Adiri bottles have no lip around the nipple so when my son released the nipple milk spills all over the bottle and you have a sticky mess! plus if you don't get the bottom on just right it ends up everywhere and the valve doesn't work correctly...there are 3 pieces but it really is not that much trouble...and we don't have a dish washer...",5

1137,"Melts all over the place. Very messy.",2
1138,"Great bottle for nursing babies, it makes baby latch the nipple similar to breast so no nipple confusion later. I'm amazed!! I use this bottle for my preemie and I'm soo happy with how she latched on to the flexible nipple. The nipple is very unique as well, I'm not sure how to describe it... The milk surround the inside of the nipple so I guess it tries to mimic natural breast feeding  Love it",5
1139,"We were using this bottle exclusively when we introduced bottles to our breastfeed baby.  My only complaint is that there is a little bit of milk that gets stuck in the outer clear plastic nipple.  Going from this bottle to others doesn't seem to cause any issues with his latch with the bottles or with me.  But we did only use this bottle for the first 4-5 feedings with a bottle.  My son is now 2 months old and we introduced the bottle at 3 weeks giving him this bottle only on occasion (I was out of the house and he got hungry).",4
1140,"These are cute and match my daughter's room decor but they don't stick very well.  Several of them fell off the wall within the first day.  Many more have peeled back partially.  We have not pulled them down or reapplied them, they are in the original spot they were put up.",3
1141,"very poor quality, the color will fade",1
1142,"We've used every night since baby was 2 weeks old. Love the white noise, isn't too loud in her room, and the nightlight is perfect for middle-of-the-night diaper changes when you don't want to turn the overhead light on!",5
1143,"A 'white noise' machine is a must.  This one works well,  but could be improved.not a huge deal, but they could improve the location of controls.  When you have a baby in one hand, you love to be able to more easily turn it on and change volume and music settings.Also, the sound quality, esp the music setting is low.I would 'test' this one in the store with a baby in one hand.Also the product feels a bit flimsy and cheap, so $40 seems on the pricey side.  I'll bet it costs no more than $5 to manufacture.Lastly We have a Sonos speaker system  with a speaker inn our master bedroom.  We are considering just buying another speaker for baby's bedroom and playing white noise through that.  I'm sure we can buy some 'white noise' in iTunes Store",4
1144,"Our almost 2-year old daughter is a very light sleeper. She has a slumber buddy but it eats batteries and turns off around the 20-30 minute mark. The Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine solves both of these issues. Because it has an AC adapter, we don't have to worry about constantly changing batteries. The timer also automatically sets for 60 minutes; if you are looking for a sound machine that has more timer options, this isn't the one for you. We also like the MP3 player option, even though we haven't used it yet. The machine is small and packs easily (we have already taken it to a hotel with us) and has a nightlight option as well, which is bright, but only if you are right next to the machine.",5
1145,"We have another sound machine for my older daughter, but bought this one for our new baby since it has the night light.  This was more affordable and is perfect...I might actually get another one to replace the one we had for my oldest.",5
1146,"Have been using this for four months so far. Good variety of noises and lullaby music, stays on as long as I want it to, easy to use, night light a nice option for nighttime breastfeeding. Also nice not to have to deal with rechargeable batteries since it plugs into an outlet. I have not tried to use my own music with it nor do I plan on it, so I can't comment on that feature. The noise level can be very quiet or very loud, which is great. I use it to muffle toddler sounds during baby naptime. Husband has used it at night to help block morning traffic noise as well. My only wish is that it didn't always glow. Easily fixed by covering it with a cloth at night though. Also it's been dropped a couple times with no problems. A good purchase.",5
1147,"We are very happy with this potty.  It's a great height for our toddler (20 months) to sit on.  We keep a box of toys and books nearby and he will sit and play/read.  It's very easy to empty and clean as well.",5
1148,"We have just started potty training and have been pretty successful at home using the Fisher Price potty that &#34;flushes.&#34; We went on vacation, and rather than lugging it with us on the plane, I bought this potty at our destination for use. My daughter HATED it and refused to use it at all. It's very thin and cheap and slides all over the place. The seat is also small and precarious. If you don't want to spend much, I'd recommend just getting a seat adapter instead, otherwise I'd fork over the extra money to buy a more substantial potty seat that won't move when your toddler tries to sit on it.",1
1149,"I bought 2 of these for my girl twins and they love them.  The cuteness of the potties attracted them immediately and they rarely have accident using the froggy potty.  The potties are easy to take from room to room, empty and clean.  Overall, the froggy potty is a great value.",5
1150,"My kids like this for potty training. I'm potty training both of my boys now, so we have this potty as well as a potty that actually sits on top of the toilet. I prefer the potty that sits on top of the toilet, simply because you don't have to clean it out after each use, but this one works as well.It was great when we were traveling recently on a long car trip. We took it with us and put it in the back of our minivan and pulled over whenever one of our boys had to go and it made it much easier than going into a dirty (and scary, to them) gas station bathroom.",4
1151,"My son sat on this, and instantly I could tell that his pee would go right over the top and straight out the front.  I didn't even attempt it, as I knew it would be a mess.  When he stood up, he held onto the handles and the bucket came up - and I just thought THANK HEAVENS I didn't let him pee in it!!!!",2
1152,"Cute frog potty. I wish that the pee pee cover was taller.  I have a very tall 2yr and they don't seem to cover very well.  Other then that it was a great price and I would buy again.",5
1153,"Bought this as a back up potty - but turns out my 2 year old loves it. With the back rest and front guard on it - it makes sure that she's sitting on the right spot as to not miss. Its easy to clean - light weight and even easy for her to carry and dump into the big potty.",5
1154,"I finally found a light weight blanket to use for the summer.  I really like the way it feels.  I hope it holds it's shape after laundering.",5
1155,"Pros about this jumper:It bounces really well unlike the Sassy one I tried.The toy on the front is great and my baby likes it. I wish other jumpers had toys like this.Cons:The seat sits really low so that my 6 month old's shoulders are at the level of the tray. This makes him really upset since he likes to sit up a little higher so that he can play with the toys and hold onto the straps easier. He loved walking around in the sassy one (which I returned because it barely bounced), but he won't stay in this one for more than a couple of minutes. Because of this I'm going to have to return it even though it makes me sad because the toy on the tray is cool.",3
1156,"My son has absolutely loved his jumper since the moment he got in it at 4 & 1/2 months old.  He would bounce himself to sleep or cry when we took him out.",5
1157,"First of all, I hate pumping. It's the bane of my existence. The insurance company sent an Ameda pump and flanges that are a bit too small. I went online in search of slightly larger flanges and found these.If you need to use medium, you need to stick the medium flange into the large flange. This is two extra flanges to wash per pump (annoying). This also means the medium flange will fall out onto the floor 75% of the time you use the blasted things (blood bloodcurdling annoying).",1
1158,"This doorway jumper sits funny to one side tilting. I don't love this and wouldn't buy it if I could do it over.",2
1159,"I love the brand. They fit very well and I never worried about leaks. I will say that I prefer the snap version. It allows a little more room and they grow with your baby. I supposed they aren't as quick in a public place and the velcro but you really can't go wrong with anything from this brand.",4
1160,"Great fit and quality. These washed well. I do not like that they don't go up the tummy very high, so the insert sticks out underneath, but they are still great covers.",4
1161,"My 3.5 month old baby does not have the coordination to use his hands gently, so when this toy is positioned on the chair, he smacks his hands over it. The toy is made out of solid wood with some plastic parts, so i am sure it hurts him. He does not cry or seem to mind, but I would have had a piece of mind if it was made out of a less solid/hard material.Also, the positioning of the toy feels a bit funny. Even when the chair is its highest position, my baby is still half way leaned away from the toy. It is a bit hard for him to see the toy, even if I have it set pretty high right under the harness strap. He would tilt his head forward, but his head is too heavy for him to do that just yet, and the double chin is in a way too (LOL).Otherwise, the toy is some entertainment for him while he is chilling in the chair, so overall, it is worth the purchase.",4
1162,"Our 8 month old likes these pacifiers as the shape seems to be agreeable for him. My only complaint is the clear color once it falls on the floor is very hard to find on lighter color carpet!",4
1163,"My baby love it and he likes to play with this little thing before he goes to sleep. It's good.",4
1164,"cute, it is a typical pop up hamper. we chose this for the nursery. good price. good quality for this style of hamper.",3
1165,"When it arrived I fell in love w/ this toy because it is so cute & colorful. I think my 3 months old will love this as well.",5
1166,"Feels solid. Love that it's not a hideous color. Lots of room for baby to play. We have cats and they haven't been able to rip through mesh which was a worry. Mattress is sort and baby seems comfortable. Sheet is soft as well. Installation is easy. Only con is that it's heavy but I chalk that up to it bring so sturdy.",5
1167,"I bought this to use to make the daycare bottles for my twins... I make 8 bottles a day for daycare so this is a huge help!  I find it is a nice quality and easy to mix large amounts of formula without clumping.  It also pours really well without drips.The only issue I have is that the handle on the lid falls off and annoys me.I would definitely suggest this for any moms making large amounts of formula.",5
1168,"This pitcher has been a God-send! The plunger does a great job of mixing and the pitcher holds enough for 1 day's worth of feeding for most babies.  My only concern was that it seemed that the measurements on the side of the pitcher were off by just a little.  After some fiddling around I learned that the measurements are correct only if you leave the plunger in the pitcher.  I don't recall reading that in the instructions so I thought I would pass that along.  It really has been so helpful that I have considered buying a second so that I can always have a clean one ready to use.",5
1169,"Great product. Love its simplicity. Does the job nicely without any issues. Not seeing lumps anymore in the formula. Can make large quantities at once. For people who want to know how it works, you dont need to rotate the handle to mix. It works by pulling and pushing the handle up and down. the blades rotate when you do that motion mixing the formula nicely.",5
1170,"I bought this to mix my daughter's formula to reduce the air bubbles since she has colic and reflux. It works great! No air bubbles and much easier than shaking it to mix it.",5
1171,"Love Dr Browns line, this is no exception,  looked like a cheap little contraption but is very functional for me. Just warm water, add formula and mix. Just don't get too passionate about mixing though. I oddly got excited about the churning butter motion and a little came out of the seem. Oops. Also I wouldn't mix the full 40oz it can supposedly hold for that reason too, spillage. Like its small size and tiny spout, makes it easy to pour precise amounts.",5
1172,"But i love it! We use it daily and it really helps to have the formula premixed and ready. Good purchase!",5
1173,"Leave blade portion in, fill with desired amount of water, the scoops of formula the mix. Make sure to put blade portion in first or you will have clumps :)  LOVE it!",5
1174,"My son has gas issues so we had to make all our bottles ahead of time to let the bubbles die down, so were were spending so much time shaking each bottle! Then we found this wonderful creation which allowed us to mix up a whole days worth of formula at a time! Saved us so much time!",5
1175,"We had another formula dispenser that worked awful!  Found this and it works wonders!  We love how we can bring 4 servings of formula and it pours out of the container quite easily.  Easy to clean, and easy to use!  I would definitely give this to any new mothers for a baby shower gift!",5
1176,"Very happy with this product so far.  We've tried a few bath toy storage solutions but they were always in our way when trying to shower.  This is up on the wall and out of the way, but is nice and sturdy unlike the flimsy net products.  It's also super cute!  I love how it doubles as a scoop to gather up the toys.  My daughter even wants to help with that task now, instead of just leaving the toys all over the tub for me to clean up after!  It was also larger than I expected, which was great, and the &#34;shelf&#34; is good for small items, although I'd be afraid to put bottles of shampoo etc as that might weigh it down too much.  I have had no problem with it sticking to the wall.  I bought the suction cup mount (sold separately) because I knew I did not want to use adhesive.  The suction cups work great.  Follow the directions, clean them and the wall with alcohol, and make sure you get the cups fully on the tile not bridging any grout lines and you should be fine.",5
1177,"Our bathroom is insect d&eacute;cor for the kiddos and I have to say how much I love this product. It stays in place and has rarely just fallen off and holds the toys in really good too. Easy to scoop up toys and clean. This bug will not &#34;bug&#34; you.",5
1178,"Dr. Brown's bottles were indispensable for us.  The extra parts suck to wash but totally worth it.",5
1179,"I love these bottles.  I do not however love all the parts but it helps with my sons gassyness so it's well worth it in my eyes to take the little extra time it takes to put them together",5
1180,"My child never had any issues using these bottles. I had lots of friends try other bottles and eventually switch to these because the others made their kids gassy or drool a lot. We were satisfied from day 1.Three notes:1. You'll definitely need a dishwasher basket for all of the parts2. Always use the round stopper when taking the bottle on the go. Yes, it's a bit annoying, but you need it to prevent leaks3. We always tried to keep the bottles upright when taking it on the go to prevent leaks. That said, with the stopper, we never had leaks except once on the plane but we didn't keep the bottles upright AND I think the pressure may have contributed to the leak.",5
1181,"My daughter did not use this system I bought her for her baby shower. There is too many parts to have to clean so she is using Avent Bottles for the past 5.5 months.",1
1182,"This is a lifesaver! We go walking a lot and it's nice to avoid spraying a bunch of bug spray on my baby to keep the bugs off. I like how this wraps around the stroller snugly and it's easily stored in the small black storage bag when we aren't using it.",5
1183,"This is unacceptable. 32 days and no shipment. Terrible customer service. Each Time i initiate a chat and ask its always next week. This time the chat operator told me it will either be shipped or cancelled in a few days. This is highchair for a child who is growing, wont do me much good months later. I will be sure to tell everyone online about my experience with Wayfair.",1
1184,"Does exactly what u want it to. Clear matches all decor... Easy to clean in shower or with hose. No odors when arrived or now . Chair hasn't punctured, stretched or torn in two months of daily use. Pets avoid it, mostly. I don't think I'd let the kid play on it though. Seems dangerous and gross for many reasons...",5

1186,"Just like others have said, is basically a glorified shower curtain cut to a round shape.  Unlike the picture shows is actually quite a large mat.  Easy to clean and does the job for a reasonable price.",5
1187,"I did not realize looking at the image that the mat is clear.  It is very thin & not what I expected.  I am looking for a mat to go under my high chairs that will move with the high chairs without scratching my floor.  This mat does not satisfy that need.  The high chair easily slides on the mat, while the mat remains in the same place on the floor.  There is no cloth backing on the back to protect my floor from the feet of my high chairs.  I am returning them.",2
1188,"We got this car seat to replace a larger (up to 65 pound) car seat after a car accident.  This seat is SO MUCH SMALLER than our old one that we are LOVING it!  It takes up less space (and thus is easier to squeeze past when getting to the back seat of the van), buckles easily, and the bonus is that it will convert to a booster when we need it. Have never tried to take the cover off to wash it, but it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to do, if needed.Cons: (very minor in my opinion)The straps &#34;fold&#34; a little easier than the straps on our old seat, and I am a stickler for straps to lay flat.The recline option sounds nice, but in practice we never use it because of the way the seat fits into the car's chair.",5
1189,"It felt a little extravagant to buy a $20 comb and brush set for my newborn, but it was just too cute to pass up!  It is whimsical but not fussy and is a great addition to the nursery.  The comb and brush and high quality.  With so much to keep track of for the baby, I like that the comb and brush are always in their place.  Once my daughter is old enough to use a real brush, she could continue using this set for baby dolls.  It would make a great shower gift!",5
1190,"I just received this, it looks exactly like in the picture online and looks adorable.  The hairbrush and comb have soft bristles for baby's hair and scalp.  Overall a very good price and buy for the nursery.",5
1191,"Great idea but you need better tape to get it to stay on wood.I have a wood base around my fire place and my son is always around it. This bumper is thick and big enough but the tape doesn't like the wood and Patrick just takes it off or it just falls off.",3

1193,"I bought this for my new grandbaby. I wanted a really soft sheet but was worried about all of the comments I read about the smell. It came packaged in a cloth-like bag inside a plastic bag. There was a little odor but it was gone after using Dreft in the laundry wash cycle. This is the second sheet we have purchased from this company. The first one is two years old and is still soft and fits the pack and play mattress great. It is washed on cold in the delicate cycle bit does go in the dryer.",5
1194,"I have many many American Baby Organic sheets in different sizes and I love them all.  Super soft and fit the size mattress they are supposed to.  I wish they made other colors but this isn't bad, muted and neutral.",5
1195,"Hurray! It fit to our evenflo babysuite 300 mattress. This is so soft cotton material & I'm glad I purchased this.",5
1196,"nice and soft and snug fitting.",5
1197,"I am not a big believer in organic products but organic cotton tends to be very soft and this is no exception. It has also gotten softer with washing. We have used it for over a year and the quality has upheld well.",5
1198,"We bought two of these and they were wonderful to put under his bassinet sheets.  Great for many uses.  Stays so soft even after several washings.  We have the mattress pad too- just as wonderful.  Very absorbent.",5
1199,"To give you an idea of the size of this, it is the same size as my changing pad. In fact I am using it now as a changing pad saver. I found this to be too small to protect the crib at all, particularly with a wiggly 4 month old. I also didn't feel comfortable that it was truly safe in the crib with her. I would rather just change the sheets, even in the middle of the night than take a risk with this product.",2
1200,"I ended up returning these. they were nothing that I could use. Small, flimsy. not for me. not so say that someone else may like them i suppose.",1
1201,"I've used this for 3 years now and its held up nicely.  I bought it with my first son and now I'm using it with my second.  We haven't had many accidents but a few and the mattress is spotless so it does its job.",5
1202,"I expected something a little larger than this.  It seemed so small when I took it out of the package that I measured it.  It is NOT 14&#34; x 28&#34; as the package says (the description says 29&#34;, which is even more wrong).  It was barely 14&#34; x 27&#34; (you would have to pull it tight to get it to 27&#34;).  I had to work to get it to tie to the slats properly and I am guessing it should be tight, but it was not as easy as I expected for a standard crib.I understand the point of this--to save sheets because your little one spits up or wets the bed--but they aren't supposed to have pillows in the crib with them and this is pretty fluffy and almost like a thin pillow.  Mine sleep with a pillow as it is, so I'm not overly concerned about it, but mine are over 12 months now also.It doesn't cover much area, so if you are concerned about diaper leaks and you have a baby that is a mover, this one cover isn't going to work.  You would do much better to have a full mattress pad with a second sheet under it (a quick pull off in the night and you are set with a clean sheet).  My babies have been big movers since they were just a few months old, so I would have had a hard time figuring out where to put it when they were smaller (they are big enough now that their middles tend to be pretty close to the middle of the crib most of the time, but I still would need 2 of these to cover the whole possible area).Really, not worth the money as you are better off with an extra mattress pad and sheet (I got all my crib sheets for $2-$3 on clearance and the mattress pads were around $10).  If this small cover isn't in the &#34;leakage&#34; area, you are going to need to change the whole sheet anyway, so you might as well just be prepared.",2
1203,"This is very soft with a high loft quilt.  It is for a basinet or changing table...I use it as a changing pad.  The softness is awesome for bare baby skin!  I like it the best of all changing pads I've used across five babies.",5
1204,"I probably should have looked at the dimensions of this before selecting it, but I was extremely surprised by just how small it is. This is basically an absorbent fabric pad that you can tie to the bed corners to put it in place. I'm sure it could probably do the job it's advertised to do, but the problem is that it seems really too small to do that job consistently if you have a baby that moves at all. It's probably fine for younger infants who'll only be turning over and we've been using it as a changing pad (it's fine for that), but it's really too small to be practically used otherwise (without having to buy a second one at least).",2
1205,"I actually ordered this by accident thinking I was ordering more of an organic sheet saver I already had.  It is nice and soft but very small (my son is 6 weeks old 14lbs and barely fits on this) and useless for bed sharing because we tend to move around a lot switching sides to nurse etc.  I will find another use for it, I'm sure....but I wanted to make sure everyone knew how small this one really is.",3
1206,"I think the product's name is a little misleading, which led to confusion, which led to some bad reviews.  Those reviews wouldn't be so bad if it had been more clear what it is you are receiving.  Basically, you get a small, quilted waterproof pad.  It's a good size for a changing pad, or a bassinet but it is not crib sized.  It has ties on each corner.The fabric is very soft and absorbent.  No strange smells.  Good quality.  It's great to have these little waterproof pads on hand.  You can place it on your changing pad, in the bassinet, or just lay it under baby's head to catch drools/spit ups so you can just change these out instead of changing out the entire crib sheet.  You'd need 2 to catch drool and pee at the same time.  You should already have a waterproof mattress cover  - then you put the crib sheet on - then you put this product on where your baby's head would be and it's just to catch the spit-ups/drools.  It's waterproof so it won't leak down to the sheet.  Then instead of changing out the sheet all the time,  you change out this little pad instead.  This is better than just putting a towel down because it's waterproof, it's soft, and you can tie it in place so it doesn't move/bunch up into baby's face.  It's not a must-have, but it's nice to have for any situation where you could use a waterproof pad.  Crib sheets are a little expensive - they are not absorbent, they are thin...so it's nice to have this nicer, thicker, softer material up under their head anyways.I really like this product.  I think it is very handy and useful.  It would be nice to have an option of different sizes.",5
1207,"This was the only toddler-size pillow I could find and it is nice that they include a pillowcase, which is nice except for the fact that it's so silky that it falls off sometimes multiple times in the night. Annoying to constantly be shoving the pillow back into the case. I tried a stick-on velcro closure but of course that doesn't last through washes, which are required with potty training toddlers.",3
1208,"I have a very chubby 7 month old so I purchased the 12-24 month size. It is a bit big but we love it. It's easy to get on and not constricting. We only use them at night. I use lanolin when I need to clean them. Works perfectly!",5
1209,"I have a few of these wool diaper covers from Disana and like them very much. They are both thick and durable. These Disana covers do an excellent job as a moisture barrier for cloth diapering and feature a high waistband and leg cuffs that provide good coverage keeping messes contained. These also tend to be on the more affordable side as far as wool covers are concerned.My reason for subtracting one star is for the lack of customer service that Disana provides. I once received a damaged item from them and when I brought the issue up to the company they told me that they don't deal directly with the consumer so any issues should be dealt with through the sellers. Disana will not replace any damaged items that you receive. That being said, be sure if you do order one of their products that you order from a seller who is easily contacted and who will stand by their merchandise even if the manufacturer won't. Despite otherwise loving the product I am greatly torn as to whether or not I will purchase any more Disana products, because while I may love these covers I also would like my money to support companies who care about their customers and the quality of their products.I hope this is helpful to you.",4

I like the idea of the holding piece to help be more hands free and how small it is but that's about it. It's really hard to find the right pump and everyone Is different but I don't think that this one is even close to mimicking/stimulating the same affect as a nursing baby.",1

1220,"We have tried about 6 other types of bottles and he would not latch on at all So glade we found these because now I can comfortably leave him with his dad and he uses a bottle why I am out, they are a wide based nipple angle is nice for his small hands to grab on to overall good product",5
1221,"It seems like all the bottle with a tube in it will reduce baby colic, and this is the only bottle I have tried so far. I guess it does it is designed to do, but washing is a hassle.",4
1222,"Bummed that I bought this in a 3-pack because it only took me using one of them to realize it's crap. We didn't rinse it right after a feeding and the milk odor was so bad, we decided to run it through the dishwasher. That just about did it to the plastics. They came out a reddish tint and smelled even worse.These bottles have so many components that take forever to take apart, wash meticulously, and put back together. I'm a busy mama (the only kind of mama there is) and don't have time for all this. They may have been great bottles at their time, but nowadays there are plenty of bottles engineered with the goal of preventing air from entering a baby's tummy. We love our Comotomo and Mimijumi bottles ten times better. Heck, even the Life Factory bottles with basic nipples work better!",2
1223,"If you are going to use dr browns then the wide mouth bottles are a must! These are easy to clean because of the wide openings on the bottle and venting innards.  They fit nicely in the dr browns sterilizer too.  I have one bottle of the narrow tall regular dr browns and what a pain! I can see why people complain about the narrow ones because they are difficult to wash.  These wide mouth are the way to go.  And I think they reduced my sons sensitive tummy gassiness.  Will definitely be using for my next kid too.",5
1224,"I researched for a long time to find the best diaper bag. I originally bought a Coach bag but returned it because it just wasn't user friendly.  I bought this bag (ignoring all the bad zipper reviews) and I LOVE it! It holds everything I need and more. The stroller clips are genius and it may be my favorite part! I haven't had any zipper issues but I also realized I for zip the main part very often. You won't be dissappointed!!",5
1225,"I bought this because I thought it would be a wipes case that I could use one handed while changing diapers.  Not so much. Also, the red button doesn't click, so it doesn't really close/lock.  And then soon after it just fell off.",1
1226,"Works ok as a wipes case, but I'm sure there are better models out there, this doesn't seal completely and hence it dries wipes.",3
1227,"Save your money. This case dries out the baby wipes, and it's a bulky case. It's actually bigger than the package the wipes come in, (we use The Honest Co. wipes), so we just carry an extra pack instead of using this case.",1
1228,"Too expensive and damn it, it doesn't stay in place and it folds over badly.. is not at all effective... I put this on me for more than a month before giving up.. :(",2
1229,"This pillow is by far the best nursing pillow. It's easy to maneuver the baby and also higher so that baby is closer to the breast. The pillow is wide enough that you can rest your arms. Great for cross-cradle nursing.",5
1230,"A breast pump is definitely an investment, and you shouldn't go cheap.  I wish I had bought one of the more expensive ones.  As my son is getting older, he's sucking harder, and this just doesn't give me the power I need, even on the highest setting.",3
1231,"Just what we were looking for! Love the raised sides, now his little legs won't get stuck in the spindles of our changing table.",5
1232,"Inexpensive and it does the job.  Love the amount of cushioning and the safety strap has been secure and sufficient.  Felt the quality was excellent for the price.  I would buy again.",5
1233,"Haven't been able to use it-it's so hard to blow it up I think we need a bicycle pump to get air into it. Too much work when you have a baby!",1
1234,"My little girl loved this pillow and it was super soft.",5
1235,"The crib I had originally registered for sold out before or baby arrived. I was discouraged until I came across this crib. I took advantage of an amazon promotion that gave me the mattress for free when I purchased this crib. The quality is wonderful. I really don't have one complaint, my husband had no problem with putting it together. He was very happy with how sturdy it was as well.",5
1236,"This crib is so cute. My son loves it and it looks great. It actually surprisingly sturdy. It was a headache to put it together, but it's well worth it.",4
1237,"we have used this gate now for several months and we like it a lot. it is very sturdy and attractive. the door opens both directions which I really like and it seems like it will last for quite some time.",5
1238,"We love this gate! Was the only one we found that expanded to the length we needed without ruining our home decor! Very durable as well! And easy to use while you are holding baby!",5
1239,"I had difficulties to find a good mattress for my baby,too many mattress,too many bad or good reviews,I spent a lot of time reading the reviews and I have decided to buy this one,wasn't sure but I needed to choose one.it has been 4 months and so far so good.my baby sleeps very well ,it is not soft,not hard.i am  happy about this mattress .",5
1240,"I work in mattress sales and can tell you this is a fanTASTIC mattress. It has the firm support that growing bodies need - especially ones that can't turn their heads in the beginning. Its holding up great 4 months later (my son is now 10 months old). We've had puke, pee, poop, and everything in between on this mattress and nothing has even so much as stained it. My sheets are another story! The benefits of soybean foam core is it will last longer than traditional high density foam and it's more supportive. This mattress in an adult size would run you at least $500 for a queen size. Very high end mattress.",5
1241,"This seems like the perfect combination of soft  and firm. Our baby sleeps soundly in this crib, and I don't worry about her safety.",5
1242,"But so-so-so-SO glad I did.Omg.These are so ridiculously absorbent, I don't need anything other than this diaper and a cover at night for my 9mo' old.If he didn't poo in the mornings upon waking, it would probably take him from 8p.m. to noon the following day without: odor, leaking, rash, ANYTHING. These are so dry (absorbent) when changing. Also, he no longer gets that wretched teething-time rash with these.I make nearly minimum wage part-time, and work (very) hard for my money. Aside from the cost, I'm glad I finally found something so worth the ridiculous monetary expense.",5
1243,"I don't dislike these inserts but they aren't my first choice when stuffing my pocket diapers. They are a tad too long for my fuzzibunz one size when on my toddler and way too big to use with my infant. They are also less absorbent after a few washes than my other inserts. Cloth diapering is different for everyone, I gave them a try based on reviews but they aren't for me and I wouldn't purchase again.",3
1244,"That about sums it up - they are awesome!  My son is a pretty heavy wetter and I had to squeeze the insert to convince myself it had actually been &#34;used&#34;.  Very trim, too.  They do take an extra long time to dry, but it's so worth it!",5
1245,"Very absorbent... soft, easy to clean, and fit nicely as an overnight booster in our bummis diapers with a prefold.",5
1246,"When my little one was 0-4 months this was my go to carrier.Pro's:Small and lightweightOrganic fabricLooks like a scarf when baby is not in it. This was great for wearing out of the house and hopping in the car - then placing baby in it once we got where we were going.Many, MANY compliments and &#34;why didn't they have that in my day&#34; comments.Con's:A little too hard on the shoulders and back to wear for long periods of time. Think school backpack vs hiking backpack. This doesn't have the waist weight distribution like a moby or ergo.",5
1247,"Okay, so apparently I'm weak backed!  I see women carrying their babies in carriers all the time with no issue.  I wore my baby for 15 minutes and felt like I got hit by a truck.  It's not the wraps fault, I've tried before when my son was born, and It just kills my back to have the weight in-front.  If you don't have my problem:  This wrap seems very durable and is quite stretchy.  The best part is how easy it is to use.  There are literally 3 pictures on the directions that show how to put it on in 3 steps and you don't even need to read the directions.  One thing I figured out after making baby really mad is that it is much easier to put the baby in it laying down.  Lay on the bed, put baby on your chest (on her/his belly) and put the wrap on while she's/he's on you.  Otherwise you'll be fumbling with one hand, trying not to drop the baby, and having a hard time supporting her head, if she's newborn.  This was so much easier.  I've tried on moby wraps and all other kinds, this is definitely way easier and seems very safe.",4
1248,"Soooo easy to maneuver!  We have a 1 year old and a 3 year old. When our daughter was born, we bought a sit n stand, which was good because you could attach a car seat to it if necessary & the upper bucket seat was just the right size for a little baby once she could hold her head up a little. But now that both kids are toddlers, the sit n stand isn't what we need. I use strollers to walk to town or pace the street for nap time. With the sit n stand, the chairs barely recline and the seats are pretty small for a 3 year old, plus the tires are plastic so walking on the grass is extremely difficult and hard on the wrists.  With this big Baby Trend stroller, off-roading is easy and the seats are huge!  Plenty of room for two toddlers. AND the seats recline so far back that they are almost lying flat like a bed, making nap time very easy.  Such a good price for a double stroller, no idea why you would ever buy a more expensive one...there's no way a $400 stroller could be that much better.  Oh one more random thing, it comes with a spot to plug in your phone or iPod to listen to music, but the speaker is pretty weak so it's quiet...you are better off just listening to it through the phone itself without plugging it in....but that's not why I bought the stroller anyways, it's just an extra feature they added to look cool I guess.  Overall, great stroller, easy to put together, easy to maneuver, shade moves to block the sun, kids love it, would buy it again in a heart beat.  A+++",5
1249,"We jokingly call this the &#34;Baby Command Center.&#34;  It is a great option for a safe place to put a young child down which is entertaining for them as well.  Our daughter loved playing with and teething on the various toys.",5
1250,"I thought this was another one of the numerous gimmicky baby items that new parents feel compelled to purchase. It looked like it &#34;might&#34; be helpful, but I eventually took it off our registry. Now our baby girl is 3 mo old and has a flat spot on the right side of her head because, despite my best efforts, that's the side she likes to lay on. We've seen small improvements already, and it's only been a few days. She only uses it on her playmat...so that's change after maybe 10 hours total. It's certainly a product I will recommend to my friends as necessary now!",5
1251,"If your child has a flat spot on their head, this is the pillow for you! We purchased this one and also the one with extra neck support for the stroller. We use this one for when he is laying on the floor in his play pen doing his exercises. It is great!",5
1252,"Since our baby has Down syndrome and other health issues, we had him lying down all the time. Because of this, he started developing a major flat head. The instructions say to not use it for sleep, but we did because he couldn't turn due to low muscle tone. After only a few weeks of using this, I started noticing the difference. The proof was when we went to see his physical therapist for his first visit and she commented that I must carry him a lot because his head is nice and round! Yay for round heads!",5
1253,"I've been using this pillow for 3 months and my baby still has a flat head. I don't think any pillow is going to help.",3
1254,"I've been using this since my son was born and he is now 2 months old. He had that really round head in the back and I needed something that will give his head a nice and even shape. This did just that plus its a great size so you can put it practically anywhere, in the car seat, crib, swing. It's also very soft and I like that the material is easy to clean, just put it in with your other laundry.",5
1255,"We ordered 3 types of straw cups - these, the Nuby 2 Handle Flip n' Straw Cup, and The First Years Take & Toss Straw Cups - for our 10 month old daughter. These cups on a 5 point scale so far:Drinkability (ability of our daughter to sip through the straw): 4.5 stars. She can easily drink through the straw without needing to use excessive suction. She does keep trying to tip it up like a bottle, and since the internal straw is not weighted she will often suck air.Washability (ease of dismantling/cleaning/reassembly: 4.5 stars. There are 4 total pieces including the top. It's pretty straightforward; we managed to figure it out without the instructions. Top rack dishwasher safe, also easily cleanable by hand.Leakproof?: 4 stars so far.  Our daughter is not gentle with cups, so this one has been turned upside down and left that way for several minutes - no leaking or dripping. The only downside is that if you shake it hard (you, the adult), it will leak slightly.",4
1256,"As other reviews suggested, buy the single replacement straws from I think munchkins? and just cut the bottom on an angle so that the straw hits the bottom and you don't waste milk or water. We gave away/tossed many. I guess the nozzle sippy cups just didn't work for our lo. She loves the straw once she learned how to use it. Just reinforce to keep it down straight so the straw hits the water. The green one  with the push top by Philips Avent to release the water is cool but overpriced for what it is, not work the extra dollars. These do drip a bit through the straw but only if you leave it laying it's side for awhile.  Best to use them for water and use the Playtext soft training ones for milk. I don't find these difficult to use or put together at all!!! So simple and in the dishwasher easy to clean. I like the straw cover so the straw does not get dirty.  Worked out well for us.",5
1257,"It does what it needs to do. The instructions indicate that you don't NEED to drill it into the wall, but I found it to be very un-sturdy when I didn't. I'm a very thin person and I still think the door on this is too narrow. I constantly bang myself when walking through it. However, I will admit that after properly mounting it to the wall, this gate has withheld the trials and tribulations of of my rambunctious  toddler.",3
1258,"I love this gate! I bought this to keep my son out of our kitchen. I was a little worried about assembling it by myself, since my husband is currently deployed, but I was able to put it together and install it in the doorframe very easily. I have had to readjust it a couple times, because if you don't get it just right, it will slip. But it's a quick fix, and I love the walk-through feature, and not having to take it out and put it back in the doorway all the time.",5
1259,"Flimsy but good for the price.  Fairly easy to install.  Instructions simple.",4
1260,"Bought two of these for the top and bottom of our stairs - quick installation (and nice options, you can either pressure-set the ends, or screw the caps directly into the walls. Unlocking the gate is very 'tough' (can be done one-handed, just requires some practice) but it's definitely too spring-loaded for little fingers to open. To save our wooden railings, we pressure-set the gate at the bottom of the stairs, then used zip-ties to even more firmly secure it to the railing, instead of having to drill holes, ensuring that even if you were to lean on the gate, it won't budge.",5
1261,"Easy to install. Easy to operate. Good height. No pinch points! Keeps my son out of the kitchen and bathroom",5
1262,"This gate is easy to install and our 18 month old isn't strong enough to open the latch.  The gate is nice and tall, so she can't climb over it.  We have it at the bottom of our stairs and it works well.  The price is great.",5
1263,"I bought this gate because I thought my cat may be able to fit through the side between the gate and the wall (she can).  With the smaller insert she can fit, but the gate is really stretched to its limit.  I'm a bit concerned that eventually my son may be able to pull it over.  I did screw the anchors into the wall, but the screwss are unscrewed almost all the way out, which makes it loose, and if I try to tighten the top screws more I can't unlatch the gate.",3
1264,"I received a BRU umbrella stroller for free (came free when we ordered baby swing) and I thought it would be fine. WRONG! I Hated this thing. No 5 point harness (didnt work well for my 4 month old at the time) and the handles were way too short (I am 5'8). It was awful. I stopped using it completely. Then i was able to find this stroller (black one- prob a few years old) in amazing condition used for $20. BEST purchase ever! I Love this thing. My 14 month old is so comfy in it and and I just wish I had it when he was an infant! Rolls nicely, tall enough handles, decent bottom storage (not big enough for a diaper bag tho, but i mainly just keep this stroller in the trunk of my SUV for quick trips anyhow). It folds up easily. Yes, it is heavier than a regular umbrella stroller but not by THAT much. I love how quickly I can fold/unfold it. My son is very comfortable in it. The ability to recline it completely is amazing.  Only complaints - it steers well but obviously not as well as my jogging stroller (i know this isn't a realistic comparison, but I use the jogger 2-3x a day and that's what I had to compare it to) but it does very well. Would I buy it again at full price? Probably not (based on MY use of it)...I feel like the price is a bit high....if I used it for more than quick trips into Panera, the park, etc. then I probably could justify the higher price tag. But it lives in my car and I only use it 1-2x a week. Anyhow, I do highly recommend this stroller!",5
1265,"My 20 month old daughter loves these pacifiers. And to be honest, I haven't tried any other brands. We should be weaning her off shortly though.",5
1266,"These pacifiers works well for my baby.",5
1267,"Great crib for a good price!!! REAL WOOD!! This crib is real wood, whichs make it seem more expensive. We also got the delta universal dresser cherry expresso. Matches perfect!! The only con is that it has a paint/stain smell to it but that is starting to go away after a few weeks. highly recommend. Beautiful",5
1268,"These bottles arrived by the promised date. I love the NUK brand and these were no exception. There was a misunderstanding regarding the color and design.They quickly contacted me and have more than rectified the issue. I was pleasantly suprise and will definitely do business with them again. Shining example of customer service!",5

1270,"My nine month old son is breast fed, but since about 7 months old he has flat out refused to nurse in public or under a cover. He also refuses a bottle and will only drink from a sippy cup! When we're out he drinks a small amount of formula, but have you ever tried mixing formula in a sippy cup?? What a disaster, clumps in the valves, just not good! This makes it sooo easy. One compartment water, one compartment powdered formula, one with puffs and we're good to go. I mix the formula in the water container and then simply pour into the sippy cup! So simple. Spouts are perfect, no leaks. So impressed. Ordered a spare lid direct from Innobaby for times that I want two towers, one for cold food, the other for items that don't need to be cold.",5
1271,"Purchased the peel and sticks along with this hamper. This item is a nice size for the twins clothes. Very pretty and beautifully made. Material made to last. Highly recommend item and seller.",5
1272,"We should have listened to all the negative reviews. Seems like a great idea. Biggest problem is that is slides all over and our son was terrified he was going to fall, into the toilet! He pleaded with me to get the one we have at home. We purchased this for traveling. Since we are visiting my mom, I went to the store and bought one and we will just leave it there. We will use the Kalencomm 2 in 1 Potette Plus we also purchased, but is larger.",1
1273,"Doesn't get much closer to a real nipple than these but you could never get them completely empty (probably upwards of an ounce that just wouldn't come out) and SUCH a pain to clean. Oy. For real. Sent these back after one use... Not happy with them at all..",2
1274,"I'd give them stars, but my husband hated them. He didnt have the patience to make the milk flow back down into the bottle with the squeeze tabs.  He thought the flow was too slow, but I thought it was perfect. Again, he is a bit impatient. Make sure you align the parts properly to avoid leakage.",4
1275,"Our pediatrician recommended these bottles for our daughter who has acid reflux. She's mainly breatfed, but occasionally we will give her a bottle. These are great at eliminating air so that she doesn't get gassy. I've owned other brands and this is the best!",5
1276,"I was using the Ventaire bottles, but since the new design change, I really don't like them! I used ventaire with my son in 2011 and loved them! Since changing, I have found out that they now have a tendency to leak! I wanted to stay with the same nipples, since my daughter was taking them fairly well, so that led me to these. I had no idea how it worked, with the liners, but after a few fails I figured it out! My daughter took to them as if I never changed her bottle! Which was great! I love that it could be either straight or tilted! They fit mine and my husbands hand great! I love the liner concept! I do not have to worry about washing all the parts anymore! Just the nipple and the ring! I do wash the bottle part about 2x's a week, just for cleanly-ness! I have also found out about the Up and Up, Target, brand liners! I think they work much better with getting the air out than the Playtex brand! I found it much easier to take these in my diaper bag! I have two baggies, one with clean nipples and one for dirty nipples, and how ever many liners I will need. So much better than toting 4 bottles!I am very satisfied with these bottles! I can find nipples and liners at any store around me! They help with the gas on the tummy as well! Do not know about colic, never had a colic baby! Just very GASSY babies!So glad, I have stayed loyal to Playtex!",5
1277,"I like these trays a lot!  There's two in a package and I find I do use both sometimes and just one other times.  My only complaint is that the lid does not seal so I have to be very careful setting these in the freezer so as not to spill my milk!  Otherwise, they work great and I take the frozen milk bars and put them in plastic freezer bags that I label and put in a bigger freezer bag.  I think this is a cheaper method than buying actual milk storage bags because I get coupons for Ziploc bags, etc.",4
1278,"This was another product that I thought was completely unnecessary and did not plan on buying. However a few weeks in we realized how hard it was to remember to wet a cloth before we undressed baby (especially middle of the night)...leaving us in the dilemma of leaving the baby on the table or carrying a naked newborn to the sink. Now we always have warm wet wipes right at the table. I've had it for 4 months and haven't replaced the filter, seems fine. It holds a lot more than ten wipes if you fold them instead of roll them. It comes with some wipes but I also use GroVia cloth wipes which are much nicer.",5
1279,"This is a big hit in our house.  My daughter insists on sleeping with it every night.  I'm grateful that it is organic, because she also likes to chew/teethe on the knotted ends.  It has been holding up well to repeated washings, too.  I bought an extra one as a back-up, because I don't see her giving it up any time soon!",5
1280,"I just picked this up in a secondhand store for my six-month-old. Goodness, this thing is clever. It kept his attention&#8230;And if I'm being completely honest, I'm fascinated by it too.",5

They clean up great and are of great quality",5

1286,"I love the design of this snack cup. The fabric is soft against little hands, versus the plastic found on other snack cups. I gave this cup to my son when he was 11 months old, and he just turned 1. He occasionally gets his thumb stuck on the lip of the fabric and can't get his hand in, but most of the time he doesn't have a problem. I think sometimes he just wants me to reach in for him :)",5
1287,"The blue fabrics looks dirty after a while. It depends on what snacks you put in because they may just stick their hand in there and take a handful of cherrios out and throw them. Just deal with the mess they will make it not matter what. It took my daughter a bit to get the hang of it. I didn't use it but a handful of times. This was the only snack cup I have bought so I have nothing to compare it to. But I sure won't buy any other one again. I will just pick up after her.",2

1290,"Not wide enough past controls. My daughter can reach right beside it and grab the knobs. The screw knobs that hold it together also come loose without touching it! The holes must be too big for screw? Overall not pleased. Should be made longer and with better quality knobs to keep children safe.",1
1291,"I went with white, first mistake...1. SO hard to clean-the straps are next to impossible to get off to clean. The bottom straps require tools to get off...2. SO many nooks for things/foods to get stuck in3. The white top/tray is cheap...the logo scrapped off within 3 months.4. When I finally DID get the straps off to clean them we lost one. I have tried to get a replacement strap, but can't get anywhere with the company...Bottom line is I wouldn't buy this again.",1
1292,"I don't use this tool as much any more now that my milk supply has regulated but initially it was a great way to start saving up milk when I started breastfeeding!  I like that the case has a spot to set it once you're done with it cause often you cannot get up right away and find a place to put it.  It's easy to wash.  It's a little bulky but I only use it when I'm feeding, I don't walk around with it in my bra.  I also thought it helped to put it on my engorged side to help release milk and my engorgement while I fed my baby on the other side.  Great invention! This was recommended in my breastfeeding class.",5

1298,"We bought this last year and have been using it every since by second baby was born.  My kids are now 36 months and 10 months old.  The 3 year old enjoys sitting in the seat and it's nice to have as an option strolling through the mall, zoo or other places we go.  Usually the 3 year old prefers to walk but this is a nice option.  I totally love my uppa vista stroller, purchased way back in 2010.  Yes, these are not small strollers.  I can put the stroller folded up in my SUV trunk with the rumble seat attached but there is pretty much no room elsewhere (and it's a big trunk).  However, it takes about 3 seconds at the most to take the rumble seat off so it's easy to take on and off in the mall parking lot, etc...For people wondering about the piggy back board too-my 3 year old barely uses it.  I have a hard time walking with her standing there at my feet and the whole thing will tip if you are going up a ramp/curb/etc.If you already have the vista and need to transport 1 more child this is the way to go.",5
1299,"If you are looking for a full-size double stroller seat, this is not the stroller/seat for you. However, the Rumble Seat is a great seat for your toddler who doesn't plan on being in the stroller for extended periods of time. The seat attaches in a matter of seconds and does not take up a lot of extra space in the trunk. I have found that if you face the main seat away from you (facing out) and then attach this seat, the toddler has a better view and the ride is a little more enjoyable. It would be great if the seat could recline a little bit, in case your toddler doses off while you walk, but all in all I would recommend this seat, especially because it really does not effect the way the stroller maneuvers.",4
1300,"No grip on the bottom. Slides everywhere. Dangerous!!! I have one that has a rubber backing that is a lot safer. Buy in the store so you can see.",2
1301,"I registered for a changing pad but I saw this one and it was on crazy sale, so I bought this one instead (and removed the other from my brick-and-mortar store registry). You really can't go wrong with some of the prices Amazon offers.This worked great on the dresser we used as a changing table.",5
1302,"Does everything it should. Cleans easy. Has safety belt. Comfy for baby. I have one in the nursery and one in the trunk of my car for changes out & about.",5
1303,"We've used this product everyday for over a year and just recently is starting to get a bit of wear. It's waterproof, easy to clean, and portable. What more can you ask for?!",4
1304,"I'm a nanny and former i/tod teacher as well as mother. This is my favorite style of changing pad. You need every bit of help you can get keeping the little ones from rolling off. When they starting turning over-this gives you a little extra protection. NEVER leave a baby unattended-even strapped in. Always keep on hand on them. This is a good quality, pad. You need to buy a cover separately.",5
1305,"We purchased this before my daughter was born to be used on her changing table. It wipes clean easily, the raised sides help keep baby from trying to roll while you change her and its light weight so its easy to move. The only bummer is my daughter is getting tall enough that her feet hang off the end now (very tall little one) so we may have to retire it soon.",5
1306,"Not sure why this says summer.  This is a nice contoured changing pad, of course, useable for all seasons.  It does have straps to secure it to a dresser or whatever, which was important to me. Are there better ones out there, sure.  But this one works well, holds up well and the price is right.",4
1307,"I had originally purchased a changing table, but the minimal pad you got was horrible, so I purchased this.  I was very pleased.  My granddaughter is now 20 months, in potty training, but I still have to use the changing table occasionally.  It has lasted well over a year and has maintained it's shape and cushioning.  I was very pleased with it.",5
1308,"This toy has no age limit because it will remain relevant for it's fun noises and bright colors that children love. My boys sometimes fight over this ball and I have to show them that there are other things to play with as well.",4
1309,"Great toy, bright colors to point out.  Also makes a good noise that allows my son to follow the toy from side to side.",4
1310,"This was my sons first ball and we both love it. The big holes make it easy for him to grasp the ball and the material is soft enough that it didn't hurt his gums while he chewed on it the colors are nice and bright over all very happy with this ball",5
1311,"Baby likes it. Has many colors and rattles inside when shaken. Easy for baby to hold item and play with it.",4
1312,"This was the first ball I gave my baby girl.  I'm not crazy about it.  She likes to grab it and shake it (the smaller ball inside makes a rattle type sound), but that's what a rattle is for.  It does not roll well.  I gave it three stars because I guess it's meant to roll just a few paces away so that the baby has incentive to craw towards it, but my daughter had a hard time rolling it.  Now that she is nine months, she just throws it.  I'm grateful it's made out of plastic for that reason.",3
1313,"This is a very well made product and my kid loves it.  She has thrown it banged it eaten it and it has held up great.  My five yr old has abused it too and it has held put for him too.",5
1314,"This is hands down the absolute best stroller accessory I've ever purchased. It can hold tons of stuff and seems like it would fit any stroller. I can fold the stroller up with stuff in the bag and it doesn't fall out. I have 2, one on each side of my double stroller. I use it for my kids sunglasses, sippy cups, etc. I used these at Disney and they were awesome!",5
1315,"A no-brainer for our BumbleRide. Who doesn't want easy-access, extra storage? And at a fair price. With how small the storage is in these joggers, gotta have one.",5
1316,"Does the job well. Wish this was offered in Organic Cotton like a few of the other straps made by this brand.",4
1317,"I'm pretty sure these are actual medela tubes. Feel the same, work the same. Cheaper then getting them thru medela directly",5
1318,"I ordered this extras set of tubing simply as a backup. After hearing about women who suddenly found a tear in their tubing and had to wait a few days for a replacement, I decided to go ahead and get a backup. I did test the new tubing to make sure there wasn't a problem, and it worked fine. It is the same tubing as the original that comes with the Freestyle pump.",5
1319,"Quite a few of the reviews indicate that they did not receive a Medela brand adaptor and that the voltage was not correct.  The adaptor I received is just as expected, a Medela brand, and just like the one that originally came with my pump.  I've been using for about a month now and it is still working just as expected.  After unexpectedly losing my adaptor, being able to individually order this piece was totally convenient.",5
1320,"I really wanted these to work. I can't keep socks on my 3 month old's feet, so I gave these a try. She managed to kick these off in her car seat before we got to our destination. Now I'm back to just buying white socks since I lose at least one every time we go somewhere.",1
1321,"My son loves to feed himself.  He likes that it is almost like his wubanub, but instead... HAZZAH... he's getting milk!",5
1322,"Bought these for my daughter but it was too hard for her to suck up the milk.  I have them to my sister to use with her daughter and she too could not get enough suction.  We threw them away :(",3
1323,"I only use this for my daughter when we are out and about and she won't sit still to eat. She loves that she can eat and still look around if we are walking in the park or at the zoo. I love that its easy to use and to clean. I have one full podee bottle but often use just the straw portion on a different bottle so when I decided to get a second one (so that I had an extra for long outings) I decided to just purchase a convert a bottle kit. This works on all of the dollar store bottles that were purchased to use for a baby shower game that until now I have had no use for. This kit will NOT work on wide bottles, only standard opening bottles, just so people are clear on that!",5
1324,"This is a great change pad cover. It looks nice and it's durable. Cleans easily and doesn't shrink after washing and drying.",5
1325,"super soft, white and perfect to change my baby on. fits perfect on his pillow top changing pad. love it",5
1326,"Pros:  Fits snugly.  Has a little slit pre-cut for the changing pad seat-belt things.  Very easy to wash.Cons:  Not pretty.  Not terribly thick.  I actually DON'T like the &#34;plush&#34; material it's covered with (a very thin microfiber-like material that, to me, just never feels completely clean).Other Thoughts:  I think the problem is inherent of microfiber material in general than this specific product, really.  My mom's sofa and one of my old sofas were microfiber, but they seemed to trap every single particle of dirt that touched them, so they always felt as if they were oily and had crumbs in the fibers no matter how many times the covers were washed.",3
1327,"This highchair is easy to use & clean. We started using this when our son was 5 months old and are still using it now at 17 months. You will need to make sure to tighten all the &#34;screws&#34;, which uses a coin, often to make sure it stays steady. There are adjusters on the straps that go over the arm as well as by the legs so you can get a good fit. It is easy to clean, the hardest part is the screws that hold on the straps and that is because I have to find a screw driver :)",5
1328,"I really want to give this mattress 5 star, BUT it slopes in the center!!! I read a nearly 100 reviews all over the place and every single one said its super flat.. Very disappointed because it is not. I didn't believe my eyes and unwrapped it, got quilted topper and layed it down..... no, it is not flat. I try to lay down and I felt like I want to roll on the side! And I'm 110 lb.. No wander my 15lb baby rolled to the side. Very disappointed.But other than this is great mattress, I like that it's heavy, it makes it  feel sturdy and reliable.",2
1329,"All we needed was something simple to keep our toddler son from bashing his head on the bath tub faucet. This does the trick. My husband installed it and said it was simple; I've watched our son play with it and he hasn't been able to pry it off. Everybody wins.",5
1330,"I bought this because I was tired of covering the tap in our bath with my hand while my daughter played in the tub. For some reason she has a penchant for crawling directly under the tap, and I was always afraid she'd bump her head. This spout cover does the trick. It is not particularly soft, but it does cover the spout enough to prevent bumps. It adjusts easily to fit over a standard bathtub spout.",5
1331,"If you don't have a knob that you pull up for the shower, it will not stay on the spout. I do not have one, and it slides off constantly so I had to use command tape to get it to stay. Otherwise it looks adorable!",3
1332,"This is such a cute thing, though I don't really quite understand it's full purpose, except to spend money that isn't necessary. I thought it would be so cute, but without the special plunger on the spigot (we have a third knob for turning on the shower) it doesn't stay on and is completely useless.",1
1333,"This is cute and easy to install on a regular tub faucet. Luckily we haven't had to &#34;test&#34; it with our baby's head but I think it will do the trick if she ever does fall into it.",4
1334,"Even though it was a little stiffer than I was imagining it to be, I think it is quite functional and awesome! The fins on the side to tighten the hold on the spout is a bit hard to tighten, but as long as you have a spout with the shower changer dealy, it shouldn't be slipping off at all. And on my spout it comes down far enough that it covers the bottom of the part where the water comes off.",4
1335,"This is great for covering the spout so a) my daughter stops playing with it, b) doesn't bump her head, c) still allows perfect water flow, and d) still allows the shower selection. It's very cute. My daughter is constantly smiling when she see its, and it stays on tight.",5
1336,"We got a blue elephant cover a while back. It would not stay on. I was skeptical about buying this. I am glad I did because it fits perfectly.",5
1337,"As the father of a 15 month old giant, I would highly recommend this for any bathtub where your child takes his/her bath. This cover is durable, and most importantly, a great way to help reduce the chance of injury for a child who likes to stand in the bath tub.",5
1338,"I didn't notice that the colors may vary.  I thought I would be receiving green, blue, and orange pacifiers for my SON.  Instead, he got purple and pink pacifiers.  Lucky him!  Yes, he uses them, and yes, he's been called a girl by strangers when they see it!  I don't want to get into stereotypes, etc., really, but if you want a specific color, don't order this.",2
1339,"Wish I would have known about these sooner!  They're great. And come, on, pump manufacturer's, who is really a medium?!?!",5
1340,"Loved these for the design. Still rather uncomfortable to wear - would cut into skin around opening. Need to make out of softer, more flexible silicone without rolled edges.",3
1341,"Pros:SoftLarge holes for nipplesSufficient venting holesNo real cons, but I did find that it's really easier to just allow my nipples to be out of a bra for a few minutes after pumping. By doing so, I'm experiencing far less soreness. These shells became obsolete for me by doing this.",3
1342,"A must have if you have sore nipples. You wear them under a bra to protect your nipples from being agitated by clothes or from rubbing on clothes. Easy to use.",5
1343,"Like any other bottle air passes when baby releases them or from sides. Without the blue pipe bubbles would go through milk and does make any noticeable difference.These are kinda wide and tall, being glass naturally bit heavy. Overall difficult to hold.",1
1344,"Way too many small parts. The last thing any parent has time for is cleaning these super small pieces. More importantly it doesn't do any better of a job than the bottles we originally had- playtex ventaire. Don't waste the money on thesebottles.",1
1345,"i am a glass bottle snob. these are perfect so i really have no complaints, other than the obvious-- they are heavy once filled. duh.",5
1346,"One of the best products on the market.  If you are nursing and using bottle during work hours, you may want to buy wide opening bottles.",5
1347,"I use these to heat up milk but I make sure to keep them at room temperature so they don't go from cold to hot and break. I just keep the milk in plastic containers until I'm ready to heat. I won't be able to take these to daycare however.",5
1348,"We LOVE Dr. Brown bottles, but the plastic ones are much harder to clean and smell like sour milk. These are so much easier to clean and must faster to heat!",5
1349,"I cannot tell you how many puzzle mats that I've tried that have that awful rubber smell. These mats did not have the smell at all for me. Our 6 month old loves crawling on the surface and I like how there are not smaller puzzle pieces that they could possible choke on. I actually bought another mat that I thought was just a generic puzzle mat but then I read the instructions and it said it was for 2 year old and up. Anyways, these puzzle pieces are just large pieces so nothing to worry about them choking so I would highly recommend!",5
1350,"Works beautifully! The first time I saw a bite mark on my son's crib I started researching ways to safely stop him. The cover is very soft fleece with a waterproof backing, it ties easily and securely to the crib.",5
1351,"Bought this because my daughter would hurt her teeth trying to stand/pull up. Wanted to stop any bad habits like crip chewing, before they start.",5
1352,"Purchased this when my baby was tiny and before she had teeth.  She isn't a bitter (crossing my fingers that she won't turn into a bitter!) but everything does go into her mouth.  This went on before she could potentially even bite her crib.  Love the fleece because it makes her crib soft and protects the wood.  I love that it protects it from potential nicks on the top since her crib is convertible crib and I hope that she uses her bedroom set till at least her teenage years.  When she was learning to walk, I found her walking back and forth in her crib and she got excited when I walked into her room... she lost her balance and hit her forehead on her crib. I truly believe that if her crib didn't have the cover, she would have gotten a nasty cut instead of getting a nice bruise.",5
1353,"Bought this after trying one of the &#34;gummy&#34; rail protectors and am so glad we did! The gummy protector did a decent job of protecting the crib from kids biting them, but it started coming off after about a year and left an awful sticky residue along the entire crib rail.Decided to try this fleece rail cover and LOVE it! It covers the entire rail, ties on easily and securely (we use square knots so it's easy to take off and toss in the washer), looks nice in the nursery, and protects the crib (and our child's teeth!)The fleece on top is soft and the waterproof bottom protects the rail from drooling. Only wish we'd found this sooner!Update: June 2014We've now used this for 2 children and it still looks new! Does a great job of protecting the crib and I love how nice it looks and how easy it is to wash. We hang it to dry (or dry on low) to help keep it's shape.",5
1354,"My baby has become a chewing machine and this has worked great on his crib.  Easy to install, soft, looks great in his room and keeps him from chewing on his crib.  Would definitely recommend!",5
1355,"This was perfect to protect my little bitter from our nice crib. It went on easy and I would highly recommend once the little ones start teething.",5
1356,"It has kept my baby from chewing the crib but who wants to pay this much for a plastic backed piece of fleece that does not even cover the whole rail. I wish i could say go by xyz but everything is about the same. If you have a crib you want to keep in good shape then I would get this product and also purchase the side rails. Otherwise skip it!",3
1357,"When our kids got big enough to stand up and teeth started coming in, our crib's wood was getting chewed up.  We found these CribWraps as a way to cover the damage, protect the crib from future damage, and soften the edges of the crib in case the kids happened to bump against it.Some things we liked:- We had no problems with the kids trying to untie them from in the crib as the fabric stretches in such a way it makes it very difficult to untie- Easy to clean- Worked great for our intended purposeHighly recommended",5
1358,"The picture shows a clear case with a clear brush.  The case is actually green.  Haven't had the opportunity to use it yet, but it seems like it will work fine.",4
1359,"I had this for my daughter and ordered another for my next baby. They are easy to use and baby doesn't seem to mind. Sometimes babies get that milky residue on the tongue so the brush side helps to scrape it off if needed",5
1360,"The price was right and the toothbrush works as described.  The case sometimes breaks, but at the price, I don't mind replacing it every 6 months.",5
1361,"We have tried many sippy cups for our children over the years. These are a rare find, as they truly do what they say &#34;They do not leak/spill&#34;...Most of the cups we've tried are more marketing hype, though these are the real deal. The only time they ever leaked, I opened the cup and found the internal part was not pressed in good enough. (Our fault). Very happy with these cups, we recommend.",5
1362,"My breastfed baby took to these immediately. Wish I could get them in a two pack that didn't include pink! Oh, well. They don't leak and are easy to clean.",4
1363,"Among Amazon items I looked at, they seem to have the highest &#34;non-spill&#34; rates. And - so far - it's true. My son's been carrying one of his 4 bottles everywhere and they never spill (well, except once when I put a fizzy drink in it and he shook it very well). The only downside may be that you don't get to pick colors. I think I got two green and pink, and red and blue in the two packages I ordered.",5
1364,"it does a good job not spilling.  But my 13 month old has a hard time getting the liquid to come out the spout and I'm never sure if she's drinking enough.  I'm dropping the rating, also, because it's so bulky it doesn't fit in any cup holders, making it useless to travel with!",3
1365,"Great cups for my toddler. I take the spout pieces out because I don't need it to be spill-proof, but they do work as spill-proof if you want that. I like that the tops fit other Gerber cups because it's nice to be able to interchange them. They are durable and hold plenty of liquid, too.",5
1366,"This works excellently and a little bigger than I thought but doesn't bother me. Does it's jobs and clip real good to stroller etc.",5
1367,"These plates are so practical and i love the colors i ordered. My son is so attracted to them and i can section his food into a well balanced one. To my son, its like eating and having fun at the same time and I surely recommend this.",5
1368,"Worth every dollar!  Pops out food instantly and I used it to make baby food and to also store chicken stock.  Highly recommend this item.  I ordered 5 trays and they are used constantly.",5
1369,"Perfect! It divides the food easily and keeps it organized in the fridge. I use different colors so I know what food is in what. It is easy to get the food out as well!",5
1370,"I love this hamper. The little mesh insert makes it so easy to bring the laundry to the washer without having to carry around the whole hamper. It's adorable and matches the rest of the forest friends decor perfectly.",5
1371,"Nice hamper.  Only gave four stars because construction is a bit flimsy but it serves its purpose very well!! Good size capacity and easy to remove hamper basin to take to laundry.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a cute addition to a baby's room!",4
1372,"These are great for infants at night because they are easy for them to find in the dark. You can wash them in the washer and dry them as well.",5
1373,"My sons LOVED and LOVE these, and have since birth.  Ingenious idea and highly recommend!  My 15 month old uses at bedtime for both his pacifier and his &#34;lovie&#34;",5
1374,"I bought this paci for a few reasons. I thought the animal attached would keep it from getting knocked too far away from baby, and he could get back in his mouth easier. I also thought when he spit it out and I was holding him, it would be easier to catch that most pacis. Well, the second expectation was true, the first wasn't. the animal isn't heavy or big enough to matter when it comes to baby spitting it out. He can still get it really far away and I have to put it back in. Also, to wash the paci you have to wash it in a washing machine, which is inconvenient so I just rinse off the nipple between washes but it gets the animal wet a lot of times, and then the animal part gets really dirty since I can't wash it in the washing machine constantly. Baby loves it a lot though and loves to just hold it even when he doesn't want to suck on it, so for that I don't regret buying it at all.",3
1375,"I have bought these for all three of my boys. I liked that the nipple is similar to a real one which I felt helped with breast feeding. As the kids get older this was the one pacifier they could find on their own in the crib which meant more sleep for me. Depending on the child, and their teething, the pacifier end would last about 6 months. As for cleaning I would run the nipple under the sink with soap or put it in the washing machine with my other clothes and let air dry for a really good cleaning. When the kids are at the pint of giving up the pacifier (down to naps only) I cut off the nipple end and let them hold on to the toy. In a day or two they are done with pacifiers with little fuss.",5
1376,"We purchased this from Bed Bath & Beyond when our daughter was an infant. When my daughter was 1 she loved playing with this. But, we very seldom was it used for its intended purpose while she was an infant. For some reason it was always hard for us to position it correctly so the baby could see it.She did like the music. I thought the pictures were great and she did as well. But, it never put her to sleep. She now plays with it in the day time (She's 2).",4
1377,"I would definitely buy this again. My wife recommends it to all mothers. It makes pumping much faster, allows hands free operation. It fit great and was extremely comfortable. She is a 36DD and got the XS-M size.",5
1378,"Once I forgot to dry it after washing. And I have to hold the flanges throughout the pumping and it was painful. I realize how useful this thing is!",5
1379,"I was skeptical about this when I ordered it because it was a one size fits all, but it fits amazingly with room to grow and room to lose!  I am about a 36C and do not need the included optional zipper panel.  I read a review that said that this panel was not included, it was included in my box along with bra straps.  I am a breastfeeding mom of a 3 month old baby girl who sadly due to my flow was becoming increasingly frustrated during breastfeeding, so I am pumping to feed her breastmilk.  My days are literally filled from getting bottles prepared, her fed, and pumping which takes about an hour each feed so this was a life saver so I can actually do other things while pumping.  For the last week I have been holding both bottles to pump and just got this yesterday and am super excited!  I am a licensed massage therapist and in need of some online CE classes, I just signed up yesterday as now I am able to do my classwork while pumping!!  This is great for any mom - whether you're headed back to work and need your hands for the computer, students, or just want to scratch your nose while pumping!!",5
1380,"David's wife here...this is a must-have for any mom who pumps!  Even if you don't think you need it, you do.  I would never wear this as my everyday bra, as they suggest.  But it is perfect for hands free pumping.  The light color stains easily though.  But the adjustable sizing and washability is great.",5
1381,"I had read about this product on Lucie's List.  I didn't think I would need a hands free pumping bra for some reason.  I was wrong, instead of holding the shield and bottles or doing one handed pumping and typing I am now free to do whatever I want (within the range of my actual pump!).  I'm very pleased with it and purchased a second one for my sister who will soon be nursing and pumping.  I just purchased the AC adapter for my pump so now I can pump during my long commute to work, this would not have been possible without this bra. It fits great too!",5
1382,"I highly recommend this hands-free pumping bra - it is so soft and conveniently adjustable.  I have tried other bras (including the Medela versions) and they don't come close to the quality and feel of this bra.",5
1383,"This was a life saver. It was so annoying to have to hold up the suction cup every time I wanted to pump. I really felt like a cow, just stuck pumping, so I would do it late at night.It wasn't a perfect fit for me, but it did the trick and provided relief. I got a lot of use out of this and would definitely recommend it to family and friends. For all my breastfeeding friends, I buy this for their baby showers.",5
1384,"best bra ever, hands down (no pun intended)..just make sure you have the flanges on your boob and not caught up in the bar otherwise you'll get milk on it (I've done that before)",5
1385,"This worked great for my wife when she was primarily pumping. The only gripe she had was that the mechanism for holding the cups had two kind of opposing layers to spread in order to insert/remove the cups. This would cause her to be unable to catch any remaining milk left over before the bra snapped back into place. This just meant that we needed to wash it more often.Other than that it worked great, she could use her hands for other things (like work on the computer). If the baby near her needed to be held, she could soothe her without having to stop pumping.",5
1386,"I wish I had learned of this bra sooner! I hated the medela pumping bra that I purchased and started looking for other options. I decided to try out this pumping bra and now make sure to tell all mommies to be about it! It's great because it actually holds the pump parts to the breasts and can be adjusted to fit whatever size you are. So if you are SUPER engorged on a certain day, you can make it fit comfortably and then adjust it again once you are no longer engorged. This has enabled me to continue working while pumping and not make a mess everywhere when the pumping session is over. Can't say enough about this bra. Honestly, I would get THIS as a baby shower gift for the mama if you know she's planning on nursing her baby!",5
1387,"I didnt buy it when i bought my pump, when I started pumping I thought this isnt right, I cant make good suction. Found this on amazon, love it! JUST PERFECT!",5
1388,"This bra seems as if it could fit all sizes with the adjustable part in the back. It holds shields securely so you can pump both breasts at once- hands free. It is soft and comfortable and very sturdy. I would suggest getting two because it can get dirty pretty quickly and you'll want another one to wear while this one is being washed. One tip: make sure none of the panels catch under the flaps, it kills the suction- user error.",5
1389,"I don't think I could continue exclusively pumping if not for this piece of clothing! It makes it go so much faster and I definitely get more milk output when using it. Easy to use with the Velcro adjuster. Love it!!!",5
1390,"It really is as good as advertised. You can get the perfect fit by adjusting the Velcro back panel, and the openings in the front do a great job of holding the pump flanges in place and preventing them from shifting. Pumping would be far more cumbersome without this bra.",5
1391,"Great diaper organizer! It holds a standard wipes box, a row of diapers & still room of creams, etc.Quality construction too!",5
1392,"I bought a size large for my boys who are about 28 lbs each and almost 2 years old. We've used these a lot so far this summer and there've been 2 poops, all contained. I hope they still fit next year, I don't have a lot of room left on the velcro and my boys are pretty thin through the waist. I like being able to double knot the tie so that they can't disrobe on their own.",4
1393,"This doesn't really fit through a standard door, so you may have to assemble it in the room the baby will sleep in. Or you could take the door off the hinges and it may squeak by. We read many of the other reviews and many of them were true to the product we have in our nursery. Great crib! Sturdy, beautiful, and it's nice that it comes with the conversion rail for a toddler bed. Many do not, so it's a great buy.",5

1395,"This drying rack is uniquely shaped and this shape will serve you well if you are washing bottles with multiple parts and breast pump parts. I used MAM anti colic bottles and often pumped with my Ameda Purely Yours breast pump. I was always able to get all the flanges and parts from both sides of the pump, plus a couple of deconstructed bottles on here. It's a really fantastic drying rack - might need more than 1 if you have multiple children's worth of bottles, however.",5
1396,"I actually have the larger version of this, as well.  They're really convenient, keep things cool for quite a while, and they're well made.  I use Dr. Brown's bottles and this fits the largest bottle, with the top.  Would highly recommend.",5
1397,"We purchased a second bottle bag after realizing how much use our first was getting.  We bring our nighttime supply of bottles upstairs in this each evening and it saves us from having to run downstairs at 3am.  This has gotten a lot of use in the past 4 months and I am happy to say both the bag and the ""ice pack"" parts have held up wonderfully.",5
1398,"It was a lot of fun when it worked, but it didn't last long. My kids used it twice before the button jammed and it won't turn on. I bought a 2nd one for a friend (before mine broke), and hers had the same issue! Broken after only using it a few times. It's cheap though, so I guess you get what you pay for.",2
1399,"It's noisy for some reason.  Because it's mounted on a swivel so you can move it around, for some reason it rattles so much.  Not sure if it's just this one or what the problem is.  It vibrates and shakes while driving.  I love Munchkin products, and the mirror works just as it should.  The vibrating noise is a little wearing though.  Need to try to figure out how to &#34;fix&#34; the sound!",3

1401,"Great dresser for a good price!!! REAL WOOD!! This dresser is real wood, whichs make it seem more expensive. The draws open and close smooth, not cheap feeling at all. I see our child having this furniture for a very long time! We also got the delta canton crib expresso cherry. Matches perfect!! The only con is that it has a paint/stain smell to it but that is starting to go away after a few weeks. highly recommend. Beautiful",5

However, I've probably tried to use them 10 times and they have only stuck to the table or counter 1-2 times.  In the times they do stick, the suction cups often pop off after a while, and certainly can't hold up to our kids pulling on them.  They also have creases on each side and on the top, and the placemat often rolls in on itself while using.  The reason I even gave them two stars is that I still find it somewhat better than the disposable option and there just isn't really anything else out there that we've found.  Great idea, poor suction cups.",2
1406,"We have a marble table and it took a while after unfolding it for the first time to get it to lay and attach completely flat. It doesn't hold light weight plastic bowls in place(which I use for my two year old for cereal or oatmeal for breakfast) but heavier bowls are great as they will not move. since he has mastered how to eat while only spilling minimum this work well at catching that minimum. The stencil design makes it hard to just wipe off food. You'll really need to make sure no food particles get caught in the stenciling. Other than those things, i think it's great and durable. Could definitely last you a lifetime I'm sure because it's unbreakable, just clean and reuse,  pack and go, attachable mat. Suction cups are strategically placed so the hold is great, no toddler can rip this from the table and throw it around for sure.",4
1407,"So many things wrong with this.- It doesn't stick to any surface. Her high chair, our table, and any restaurant table I've tried it at.-It doesn't lay flat. If it just laid flat, it would at least serve some function. But it curls up and my baby immediately wants to lift it and play with it and see what's under it.- The design gets food embedded in it.Why is this ten $? The flat plastic placemats we already had work way better.",1
1408,"At first I did not like this because of the folds not flattening out.  I now like this and it did eventually flatten out.  It sticks well to the table and the thing that catches the food works great.",5

This toy actually keeps him pretty busy and I can get to near by places without screaming!  The only down side is that the musical sun didn't work, even after I replaced the batteries.  But I needed it so desperately I didn't want to send it back!",5
1414,"I bought this despite some reviewers saying it didn't fit well on their Britax carseat.  But desperate times call for desperate measures!!  My six month old son screamed every time I put him into a carsat.  I was willing to try almost anything to distract him and give us some peace.This toy bar only sort of fit on my Britax B-safe carseat.  Well enough that he could sort of play a bit, but he does put it too close to his face as he plays with it.He likes the crinkles on the lion's head.  The rattles in the parrot drive me insane in the car on the way to/from work.  I'm not a fan.  He really likes the strawberry teething ring thing.  The musical sun thing quit playing after a day or two, but that was a blessing in my mind.We have had the most fun with this using it as a distraction device on the shopping cart in the grocery store.",3
1415,"I usually try to steer clear of products that contain chemicals, so I should've gone with my first instincts and passed on the pottyPod when I read that it contains an ""antimicrobial additive.""  Although antimicrobial substances are usually added to products with the best of intentions (e.g., to kill germs and prevent odors), most of them are chemicals with very questionable toxicity and side-effects.  When I first researched the pottyPOD, I actually called the manufacturer's Customer Service line to ask what kind of plastic the soft seat is made of, and what type of antimicrobial agent is in it.  The rep was happy to inform me that the soft part of the potty seat is made of high-density polyurethane foam, but she was tight-lipped about the antimicrobial additive, stating that that info was ""proprietary.""  By that point, I'd already ordered the pottyPod, but I should've cancelled the order after my conversation with Prince Lionheart Customer Service.  Instead, I decided to wait and check out the actual item ""in person"" before deciding whether to keep it or not.As it turned out, that was not the wisest decision on my part!  As soon as I opened the box in which the pottyPOD was packed, my nose was immediately assaulted by a strong chemical smell.  It was coming from the soft part of the potty seat.  I couldn't tell whether the source of the fumes was the polyurethane foam itself, or the anti-microbial additive, but either way, I was past the point of caring.  Nothing that smelled that bad was ever getting near my preschooler's bare bum!  In addition, the so-called soft, comfortable seat is actually not that cushy.  It looks and feels almost like a gel seat made out of extremely compressed foam, which is only about 1/4-inch thick.  Honestly, I can't see it doing much to ease the discomfort if your little-one needs to sit on the potty for more than a couple of minutes.  The pottyPod is definitely being returned.  (The only reason this potty got 2 stars instead of 1 was that it's height-adjustable, which makes it good for taller/older toddlers and preschoolers).Grade: D",2

I went for the cat one which is so cute and the colors are nice and bright too. my little one saw the butterfly and didn't want to let it go, so I got it. The size a little big for her now but she can grow into it and use it for some time. It's a good size to take toys to grandma's house.",4

1421,"My daughter was a preemie and we had a really hard time finding bottles she liked besides the uber expensive ready to feed Similac bottles and nipples.  We had actually taken to using the Similac ready to feed nipples on other bottles because they were the only kind she liked. However, those nipples smell like really bad rubber and I think they are technically only recommended for one time use so we had to find something else.We tried Avent and Nuk, no dice. Then we tried these! She liked them right away. They are very small bottles, but we had a very small baby. If your baby is regular size I would probably skip right to the 4 oz bottles.  We have since moved onto 4 oz and are now on the huge 8 oz bottles. We still keep these around to hold extra formula and for &#34;snack bottles&#34;. The components really do help reduce bubbles and spitup.**I would also highly recommend you purchase the Dr. Brown's formula pitcher. It makes the formula very smooth and bubble free. My daughter only spits up now when her stomach is really upset or she is sick. She gained weight much more quickly after she stopped spitting up a good amount of her bottle due to air bubbles!",5
1422,"We've gone through a lot of gates over the years between dogs and kids and this one is by far my favorite.  Unlike a lot of gates, you can swing this one open easily and it doesn't have a bar to trip over.  All of the components are very sturdy and metal.  No plastic to break off.  Feels very secure.  It is easy for an adult to open and it can swing in either direction or you can set it to open in one or the other direction only.  We chose to have it swing both ways.  I want to replace all our other gates with this one.",5
1423,"We bought two of these gates based on reviews.  We had them professionally installed.  After we spent $200 on the install (we have a brick wall...), we discovered that one of the gates latches improperly.  One gate is easily opened (for a parent) with one hand.  The other is a pain in the rear and I have to fight with it every single time.  The latch is two pieces that you push and then lift.  One of the latch pieces sticks and I have to get it just right to get the door to lift.",3

The crib looks beautiful, but there were some cosmetic marks on the wood (shipping damage? or due to poor package cushioning?).  My husband did not want to exchange, but if it had been my choice alone, I would have.  My husband wanted to assemble this piece himself, but he quickly found he needed a second person to hold the sides while he assembled.  However, it was easy and did not take long to assemble (a two person job with the enclosed allen wrench).  Overall, pleased and recommended (although not highly).",3
1427,"I'm still on the search for the perfect stainless steel straw sippy. Straw sippy cups are better for breastfed babies as they won't alter the latch. This one is the best I've found yet. It's not as bulky as the thermos straw cups and has handles. It does leak in straw mode if tilted, so is not great for travel. I wish it came in a smaller size for younger babies. It's being used by baby number two now so it is durable.",5
1428,"We've used these sippys for about 6 months now and love them.  We haven't had any issues with them leaking at all and my son has no issues drinking from them.The only downsides are that they dent easily and the handles are starting to look like they are going to crack (the orange part at the top of each handle has a white &#34;crease&#34; showing signs that it will snap at some point) - this is due to the handles being very thin and not able to handle the weight of a full sippy.  This is the only design flaw that I see, but it needs to be addressed!",3
1429,"This is probably my LO favorite toy.  She's now 6 months but she's like it since ~3 months.  The only bad thing about this was she would suck/chew on the foot parts of the toy and the stitching came apart and all the stuffing came out; I had to re-sew it.

At first she just stared at the mat but now that she is older she scoots herself close to the pole parts to try to grab the animals or she kicks the pole parts to make noise.  This is definitely a baby purchase that your baby will get months worth of use out of-something I have learned is a rarity among baby purchases.",5

We have a hardwood floor so it's a necessity for my creaky old knees.  I also do light yoga on this thing (with my yoga mat on top so I don't mess with the alphabet.)  It's nice. It feels really solid and can handle my downward dog with ease.As others have said, the letters do come out like puzzle pieces.  This isn't an issue for us.  When it comes time to build an epic fort, the letters will make nice port windows from which to shoot at ninjas, pirates, and other denizens of the playtime underworld.  For the kids, of course.  &#60;___&#60;You know what bugs me about this mat?  The letters have a particular color scheme except for three.  The K, L, and 7 are wrong.  I have them arranged on the floor in alphabetical and numerical order and the resulting pattern is nice.  I like things in order.  The K should be purple.  The 7 should be green.  And the L ought to be orange on a purple field.  The fact that these 3 and only these 3 tiles are off drives me absolutely up the wall.Other things I found worth mentioning is that the mat doesn't smell.  Some foam stinks.  This does not.  The puzzle pieces and assorted letters/numbers fit nice and tight in their respective slots.  The thing springs back well after being walked on.  It does show marks from heavier things, like the swing, but the foam didn't cut or tear.  Strong stuff.  Fort worthy stuff.  :-)",4
1450,"We are very pleased with this product and believe that our son has got the absolutely got the best educational value out of these tiles. At 18 months, he knew his ABCs and 1 through 10, and will always try to take the letters and numbers out from the tiles while playing. It works well not only for the alphabets and numbers, but is also useful to teach colors and spatial cognitive capabilities at an early age by moving the numbers around to put them in their respective slots.You can also be creative and create 6 sided enclosed cubes with several letters and teach spellings as they grow up. I think it is a great value for money for any toddler.",5
1451,"The letters are too loose inside the squares and if I move the individual squares the letters just fall out. I don't know if this is defective or normal, but it's just too much of a hassle. I'd rather have pieces that don't fall apart like this.",2

Each placemat has a cute design on it- with animals, plants, etc in bright colors. The designs are not commercial (ie: Disney, TV show, etc) which appealed to us as we try to limit her exposure to these things.  They are thin pieces of plastic that have 4 tabs on the bottom that you pull off. The tabs run the length of the 4 sides of the placemat. They are sticky enough to stick to a table yet easy to remove. We never had issues w our daughter pulling the sheet off. You can also do light cutting of food on it as the plastic is somewhat sturdy. They ar absolutely perfect and necessary for eating out w a young child",5

It does take two hands to put on the table though.  My husband has to hold the baby while I put one of these down.  I'm not sure how you could do it if you had to hold a baby too.",5

I love them for mall food courts and restaurants, not only because they keep the food clean but also because they make clean up a bit easier.  I haven't had any problems with them sticking too much or too little and my 1 year old hasn't tried to peel them off yet, although that may just be a matter of time.  We even used on on our kitchen table for a number of weeks while we used a clip-on booster seat. We changed it every few days and were able to wipe it down with soap and water between meals with no damage to the wood beneath.",5
1462,"This product is really convenient to keep in the diaper bag and use and throw away if we dine out.  The only thing that would improve on the design is if the sticker around the edge would be covered by one continuous strip.

The mirror is clear and the materials are good quality. The reason I love this mirror over stationary ones is because I can move it from room to room. In the mornings we play with it upstairs. Then in the afternoon it sits by her bouncy seat and during dinner it goes to her highchair! Its great! It could be a little more stable in the tripod position but works none the less.",5
1483,"An instant favorite of seven-month-old mirror-fascinated boy. Reflected image is true; mirror is lightweight so easily manipulated by him. Although the fabric stand aspect is not stable, the mirror is easily propped against anything nearby, and could be attached to a crib or other object if stationary position is preferred.",5
1484,"There is a lot that I like about this item. The mirror is not a fun house mirror.  The fabric seems sturdy. I strap it to the rungs on her crib but it doesn't look like it would stand up on it's own.",5
1485,"this is such a great inexpensive mirror...so wonderful for tummy time or back time. You can also use it in the crib, too.",5
1486,"If this thing sat up for more than two seconds it would be wonderful. The velcro doesn't hold it closed tight enough to hang from his pack and play either.",2
1487,"My daughter loves this.  The mirror is not perfectly clear b/c it's made out of plastic but a baby can see her reflection so it does the trick. It comes with ties so you can attach it to a crib which is where I have ours.",5
1488,"My daughter loves this mirror.  The only issue I have with it is that the velcro looses it's stickiness over time.  Maybe snap buttons would be a better option.",4
1489,"Our 7 month old likes the toy itself and the spinning motion, but we can't get this to stay attached to her highchair tray for long, which is why we bought it.",3
1490,"This toy is great!  It sticks and stays stuck!  I take it everywhere, stick it on everything, and my Grandson always enjoys it!  it's weighted well and so spins easily with lots of things to watch and play with.",5
1491,"We keep this on baby's high chair to keep him entertained and he loves it. I just wish it was BPA free because he likes to put it in his mouth",4
1492,"Our 7 month old has played with this since she was 5 months. Great distraction while I prepare meals. We also attach other small toys and teethers with plastic links.",5
1493,"We had other stations so we decided to get this one. My daughter has no interest in it really because it's kind of boring. The ones with sounds are much better. This would be better if the light was brighter or if it had different color lights. You really wouldn't notice the light on the ball in a well lit room.",3
1494,"It's okay.  It doesn't stay stuck down at all.  I also don't like that it's weighted unevenly.  The round ball that is supposed to light up, and does so only very occasionally, is heavier and so always swings to the bottom.  I hung it from some plastic chain and my Grandson likes it okay.  It's too heavy for him to hold and play with, and as I said, it doesn't stay stuck down to anything for even a second so hanging it from the plastic chain is about the only option.",3
1495,"Baby just plays with sometimes. It is really sturdy and I love the popping balls. It has a rubber ring on the wheels which makes it drive easily on any surface. It is also smaller than expected.",4
1496,"This is one of my son's favorites. He's been playing with it since 6 months of age and is still enjoying it at 12 months. Highly recommend!",5
1497,"Popping is weak and subtle; wish it was more vibrant. Winding of the back wheels is a nice feature to the toy. My toddler is hard on toys but this toy has remained in good condition so far.",4
1498,"My son had this since birth.. But really got interested in it around 6m and by 8m could crawl around pushing it. His love of cars started early.",5
1499,"My daughter had these in 6-12 month size and they were awesome! She wore them to the indoor and outdoor pool until she outgrew them at about 18 months old. I got the 18-24 month size and she wore through them much more quickly now that she is more mobile. They got a hole in the bottom of both shoes in just a couple of months. Maybe for sandy, beach only use they would have lasted longer, but not on the grating pool deck. Good for little feet but older runners need something tougher.",4
1500,"This is the perfect size for little hands. My kids never really cared for pacifiers but bought this for car rides and she loved it. This one is so soft. Easily washed and dried with no problems. A cute shower gift.",5
1501,"I kept two in the house (one upstairs, one down) and one in the diaper bag.  A great infant toy.",5
1502,"The price could be better. But they are waterproof so if your baby pees you can save whatever they are on if your fast. They don't absorb. So be careful. They are long enough though so using in public changing room they are great",4
1503,"This works for me when I'm in disgusting places and I don't want my regular changing pad to touch the surface.  I can lay this down and then put my changing pad on top.  It wide enough to give good coverage.  i love that you just throw it away when you are finished.  I always keep one in my diaper bag.  It is not padded, so that is why I still use my changing pad on top of it for a little cushion.",5
1504,"I bought these thinking they would save me room in the diaper bag and they are fantastic. I keep one in the diaper bag and unless it is a poopy diaper I fold it back up and reuse it. (I keep in a zip lock bag so it doesn't contaminate other things)",5
1505,"I like the holes in the bottom (fun in the bath), but my son lost interest pretty quick. Also I have learned to hate toys with more than a few pieces because after about 30 minutes things roll under furniture never to be found again",3
1506,"My 9 month old loves them! Colors are cute. It has different designs on the bottom too. I like that the set has so many cups.",5
1507,"First time breastfeeders - invest in these!!!  If you think birth was bad wait until your nips feel like they are being rubbed with sandpaper everytime baby nursed!  OMG - these are wonderful and worth every penny.",5
1508,"The first few weeks of breastfeeding suck...no matter what anyone tells you, it just does!  I was ready to give up multiple times but then I found these and they helped!  It really helped me got to week three when it got easier for me and I no longer needed them.  So get these to help you stick it out and good luck!",5
1509,"I packed these in my hospital bag before giving birth to my daughter and was thankful for that! My baby had trouble latching on at first, making my nipples sore and cracked. These gel pads were a HUGE help in those early days - if I hadn't had some kind of relief, I might have given up breastfeeding. Not only did these help with my sore nipples, but they were also great when my milk came in and I was engorged. And they're even better if you cool them in the fridge first! Just make sure to gently wash them after each use - if you're nipples have open cracks or sores, you can risk infection by trapping the bacteria between the pad and your breast, only prolonging the healing process. I don't use the pads much anymore now that my daughter and I have established good breastfeeding techniques, but I always keep these on hand just in case!",5
1510,"I was to the point that it was painful to wear a shirt. These definitely cushioned thd blow and made me more comfortable.",5
1511,"This Mobil is cuter than I expected. So colorful, bright and fairly large size. Moves so quietly in the breeze, no batteries needed, no noise and no tacky designs. My little guy loves it and so do I. Highly recommended !!! Price is great as well, super cute as a gift for any child or baby shower present.",5
1512,"I didn't think about this before I bought it, but now I see my baby can't grab the handle because there are rings on it.  The rings are tight enough to the handle that it's tough to just grab those instead.  She likes the spinning mirror part though.",2
1513,"This toy is nothing fancy but for the price it is a nice toy to entertain a little one. The thin middle part makes it easy for a baby to hold. There are also several development appropriate features that make it entertaining for a little one including contrasting colors, a shiny mirror, noise, and texture.",5
1514,"It's incredible how many baby toys are just not made for small babies' hands. This product got it right. My baby holds it well. He doesn't love it, but it serves its purpose of teaching him to reach out and grab things.",5
1515,"I wiped the toy clean as per previous review but it seems that baby's drool may have leaked inside. one side looked a bit wet inside.",2
1516,"My 6 month old daughter got them 2 months ago, and LOVES them. She is putting everything in her mouth - because she is teething. She really enjoys the different textures on each ring. My best friend's daughter is 2 days younger and bought the same set after seeing our 2 girls together.",5
1517,"Who knew that my daughter would choose these rings as her favorite toy. We have to make sure always have at least 2 rings with us no matter where we go. When she was just learning to bring things to her mouth, these were perfect because they are light and small and easy to hold. These were the best beginning chew toys!",5
1518,"My 4 month old loves to grasp & jiggle these. I have them hanging above the changing table. When she's older we'll play letter learning games with them for sure.",5
1519,"I initally purchased these as teethers, but the plastic part is too hard for my son to chew at this point. These are a good size for him to hold and swing around.",4
1520,"Best toy for small babies who are staring to grab toys. Inexpensive, cute color and design and easy to clean. My baby loves it",5
1521,"Baby liked the rattle but it does not have anything in the football parts to make it rattle like traditional rattles. What makes noise are the rings and some small balls in the handle.",4
1522,"Love this toy because if offers a variety of activities for my grandson to do. He can push panels and it makes noises like counting, abc's , and sings music. All the things he loves.",5
1523,"This is a great invention. Better than classic swaddling, which my son got out of anyway. I didn't want to use regular blankets when I was sleeping and even when we did during the day he kicked them off completely in his sleep. The sleep sack kept him warm safely. The option for arms in or out was also helpful as my son preferred his arms out. The chocolate color is very nice and rich also. I have since bought multiple sizes, colors, and types of this product. I also bought extra to keep at Grandma's so blankets are never used when we are not around.",5
1524,"I was looking for another sensory toy and found this at pottery barn.  Was way cheaper on Amazon and my son really likes it.  I put it around his wrist or ankle and he shakes or kicks it.",5
1525,"Not much to them and they do the job.Small enough for a baby's face and body, they could be a little plusher.The cloths are okay but eventually look a bit ragged around the edges.  I do not place ours in the dryer.For the price however and a short term use projected,  they are appropriate choices.",3
1526,"These are a nice quality. They go very well with my daughters chosen choice of color pallet that she had picked. The print is not too bright but nice. The washcloths are very soft.",5
1527,"I am a little disappointed ,it is very very small.i use it to clean my baby's face.soft but too small",3
1528,"These wash clothes are Not as soft as I hoped, they feel a bit scratchy for washing a newborn baby.",2
1529,"These are really soft and got my lil babes clean. I will say the synthetic fabric blend holds the soap a bit more than I would like. (You know how you rinse a towel to get the soap out? These didn't seem to ever really get all the soap out. I would have to launder them to reset. I don't think I over soaped, it's just how they are. Oddly, for more grimes clean ups (post chocolate or dirty feet cleaning) they didn't clean as well as I would have liked, but. I think that's just how kids towels w this material react. They stain. :(Overall, they did what they needed to but I wouldn't use them for tough clean ups or grimes baths.",3
1530,"Got a couple packages of these to use as cloth wipes.  They have a super soft side and a &#34;scrubbing&#34; side.  Good buy!  Definitely recommend as an affordable solution for cloth wipes.",4
1531,"Soft and easy to wash. I use it to wipe my baby's face and during baths all the time. Good buy.",5
1532,"This a generous cover with nice fabric and a little pocket in the front, perfect to hold a paci, your breast pads, or a nipple shield.  I initially used it when my baby was nursing, and it covered her well and I could still see her thru the top.  I now use it when pumping, and it's big enough to cover all the parts required for pumping, including giving me side coverage.  Very pleased.  The bag it comes in is also nice, and it washes well in the washer.",5
1533,"I love this product. We are an outgoing family and this amazing stylish product has enabled us to enjoy our adventures, dragging the baby everywhere to public places. If you are sitting behind a table it is even hard to say one is nursing a baby, it looks like a very fashionable loose top. Great purchase.",5
1534,"Worth it. Super easy to use. Saves a boatload of time and helps keep things clean and sterile. Ample capacity and good reusability. Great value.",5
1535,"I have officially switched fromthe Medela sterilizing bags to the Munchkin brand.  Overall the functionality is the exact same but the Munchkin actually has a few advanced features like the &#34;cool grip&#34; which is nice when grabbing the bag from the microwave.  The only thing I don't like (and the reason I only gave it 4 stars) is the pour spout.  The way the pour spout was designed the water pours out extremely slow and it doesn't get all the water out.  This is minor.  Overall the Munchkin bags are much more cost effective for working Mom's who will be pumping quite a few times a day!",4
1536,"This is one of the best ways to clean bottles and know that they are clean. They are easy to use and they work.",5
1537,"we are using this every day and we love it. it fits perfectly to our tub and the kids love taking baths in it.",5
1538,"My daughter absolutely loves this jumper... and, I do too.  It makes her happy and gives me a few minutes to get the laundry or do some dishes without worrying about my little girl being bored or crawling and finding something she shouldn't!  She's 7 months, but we've been using this for about two months and it never seems to grow old... she just adores it.",4
1539,"My son slept in this when he was an itty bitty! They say it's not the best and that babies should sleep laying flat unless Rhett have acid reflux which my son didn't. However between the vibrating and the rocking my exhausted baby did not stand a chance of fighting sleep. We used this during the day when he needed to nap.",5
1540,"Tough to rate something like this, so I will just say that my baby is alive and well and it could be thanks to this cover, although chances are it's not...? Better to be safe than sorry :)It's not extremely &#34;crinkly&#34; sounding so that's cool.",5
1541,"After reading a new zeland study, about how the fumes and gas coming from the matress may play a roll in SIDS, I didn't think twice in getting one for my 3 weeks old baby. Easy to put, it doesn't feel like you have a plastic beneath the sheets at all.",5
1542,"I was hoping there was some kind of backing on these to help them from sliding around in the bra so much.  I have found myself to be leaking through my bra and realized that the pads had slid out of place.  I have other pads that I bought many years ago with my first son that have a lace back and help them from moving around.  Otherwise, I like these because they are soft on sore nipples.",3
1543,"These are awesome nursing pads - super comfortable. But during the first month or so they tended to get soaked through - especially in the middle of the night. They were great for my sore nipples and sensitive skin but I wish they'd have been better at preventing wetness when I was leaking the most.",4
1544,"I bought these with my first child and wasn't very happy with them. You get three pairs in the 6 pack which if you had a heavy flow like I did you would easily go through all three pairs quickly. Each feeding and these were soaked-- there is no protective backing to prevent leakage. Wake up in the middle of the night and these were soaked. Hear my baby cry and these were soaked. This was frustrating and to top it off you are supposed to hand wash (who has time for that?) and let them air dry. They hold up well to washings and dryings but they do become a bit smaller and oval shaped which led to them not fitting quite right without constantly adjusting. I don't have time for that and I'm certainly not going to invest in many order when I can easily buy disposables and avoid the headache and possible infection from a soaked pad. On the positive side the material is soft on the tits.",2
1545,"Theses breast pads are super soft and wash very well they stay in place well also. They have so far held up to multiple washing's without pilling and adsorb well.",5
1546,"Wow - at this price these could be the best ORGANIC pads. Sadly as I have a really heavy let down these did not protect me from leaks on the opposite side from where baby was nursing. Bummer.",3
1547,"These work just fine, but they're a little flat and don't tend to mold well under the bra. They can sometimes bunch up a little on the edges to account for curves of the breast. They wash well, but don't dry completely when tumble dry low. I usually need to put them out for a few hours afterward for complete dryness, but it's easy enough to do.",3
1548,"These look thick and nice in the package, but they shrink down to a weird oval shape and a much smaller size.  They barely hold any leaks, too.",1
1549,"These are great, soft, absorbent. I love them. I do wish they were a tad thinner, because sometimes they can look lumpy in a bra with a fitted shirt. But overall  love these the best. Reasonably priced, washes well and hold up over time.",5
1550,"I liked this item because it was org cotton and didn't have the lace that most of these have (i.e. will not show through a tank top).  But the pads are thin and lack any type of waterproofing, so it will take all of 10 mins to soak right through this if you are leaking.  Good for aesthetics, but functionally is lacking.",3
1551,"These are much softer and absorbent than the Medela ones I purchased. They are also a much better price. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because one pad is oval and the rest are still round. Otherwise, they are great.",4
1552,"I have two of those and hang my purse and bags all the time!!! Even my older child holds it when we are in crowded place!",5
1553,"I had the Mommy hook on my stroller for the last 3 years... two kids later, I was sick of the Mommy hook always sliding to the side of my stroller. These hooks solve that problem! So easy to install, amazingly easy to use, this is one of my new &#34;musts&#34; for any new mommy! They hold my ever-so-heavy diaper bag, shopping bags, and whatever else needs hanging!No complaints, simply praise after praise for these wonderful hooks. LOVE them!",5
1554,"I used to have the mommy hook but that thing kept getting in the way of my Joovy folding and it finally broke off.  These Buggy hooks work great and I like them more than the mommy hook.  Simple to put on, I like that they're adjustable and come in a pair.  Can use for shopping bags or for the diaper bag.  I highly recommend!",5
1555,"Meh. To be honest I haven't found a stroller hook I like yet from any company, so maybe I'm just looking for something that doesn't existing- but regardless, this was a flop for me.",1
1556,"Fits on any stroller, is super stable, extremely useful, and inexpensive. I have recommended these to every single friend with a baby. Best thing I ever got to put on a stroller.",5
1557,"I don't always use bibs but when I do, I only use these. They are the best bibs ever. The large size and over-the-shoulder design keep messy little eaters relatively clean. They also wash well and true to the manufacturer's claims, get softer with repeated washings. They also stay cute even as they fade. I have never used them as burp cloths but as bibs they more than suffice.",5
1558,"Baby girl looks so pretty in this bib! It is soft and thick and gives excellent coverage. regular bibs just kind of sit there and flip up and are so annoying, The only downside with this is when she is fidgety and puts her arms up, this covers her face. And, you don't want to put them down in a crib with this on (OBVIOUSLY). My husband did just that and I walked in to find baby asleep with this over her face. Sigh. But, it's really great and I will probably purchase a few more.",4
1559,"For a spring or summer baby these are a must. Very soft, nice big size. Great gift. Make sure you buy this version and not the made for Target version as those are smaller and harder to swaddle with.",5
1560,"Amazing quality and love that it's multi-use. Someone gave one similar to this to me as a gift, when I had my son, and I still use it to this day as a bib now that he's one. I gave this one as a gift to my cousin and she loves it just as much!",5
1561,"This item was torn to shreds after one run through the washing machine.  None of my other blankets by this brand have had this problem.  Amazon accepted the return easily, but I will be buying Halo sleep sacks exclusively from now on.Also, the wrong pattern was shipped to me - I ordered a gender neutral pattern and received one for boys.",1
1562,"Great quality and perfect for the warm summer months.  Would have a ton of these if I didn't live in the mountains where it eventually turns cold.  Excellent buy.",5
1563,"I love this sleep sack-- I actually like it more than the Halo ones which I believe started the sleep sack thing.  It's so soft and comfy and especially light for summer!  Very pretty also!",5
1564,"Nice, very light weight for the warm summer months.  I love that the sack zips to the bottom so there isn't anything poking the baby by her face.  Only slight complaint, is that it is really long.  A little cumbersome.",4
1565,"I wanted something light for the summer. This one is very light, too light. It's thin like cheesecloth fabric. I'll still use it, but had to buy a different brand too.",4
1566,"These sleep bags are great, especially for a spring/summer baby or someone who lives in a warm climate. They're super soft and comfy for baby too - No itchy tags or seams. We have a ton of aden & anais in our house and they're our favorite products by far!",5
1567,"Super light sleeping bag is perfect for summer time. The size large gives my 13 month old plenty of room to move around in while still being safe. It has held up well over many many washes.",5
1568,"Be aware, these sleep sacks are not thick like their burpy bibs (a family favorite) but thin like their swaddle blankets. Even in the summer, we have found that our baby needs something more substantial. However, for people without air conditioning they might be helpful.",3
1569,"Great for summer months when I don't want to use the heavier cotton ones.  These are much longer than other brands so be sure to look at the sizing, my little one wears the medium in Aden + Anais but is a large in all the other brands we have.",5
1570,"My son doesn't sleep well with out a sleep sack and this is the perfect weight for really hot nights when he doesn't need his warmer fleece or cotton sleep sack.  Washes and dries really well.  We've had them in every size and they get washed and dried 1-2 times per week.",5
1571,"I work from home and still answered e-mails or take phone calls while I pump. A pumping mom's best friend -buy it !",5
1572,"Thicker better quality silicone than the Dr. Browns nipples. Only drawback is the hold seems to stretch out faster. Now that my baby is older these seem to be his favorite nipples.",5
1573,"It's very narrow, which is great for a smaller car, but when the child falls asleep, he is bold upright, making his head sag forward. It does fold, but it is VERY heavy, making it unwieldy and awkward on a flight or just to install in one's own car. I'm sure there are better and lighter options now. When we size up, we'll get something more comfortable.",2
1574,"We really liked this chair, its great for infants all the way up to toddlers. In my opinion there are better options, but this one held up well.",3
1575,"I love this bouncer and my youngest daughter prefers it to her vastly more expensive Baby Bjorn bouncer. A must have that also matches our high chairs.",5
1576,"I honestly love this bouncer, my feet can tell you otherwise... It definetly will not flop over because of the wide base. I've tripped many times with the base of it since it really sticks out. Other than some jammed toes, my daughter really seems to enjoy it, I would recommend buying! It's easy to assemble and the material can be quickly removed for a wash.",4
1577,"Pros (many, and that's what saved this high chair from a one-star rating):- Comfortable- Adjustable- Safe and steady- Solid construction- Compact enough- Cover wipes clean easily and is also removable/washable- Pretty (I bought the Mocha Butterfly)Cons (only one, but HUGE):- Only 2 out of 7 straps are removable/washable.After several months of use, I've developed an effective but exhausting cleaning routing that consists in spraying the straps with heavy-duty, suffocating stain remover, rubbing them like a madwoman with sponge, then holding the seat above the sink with one arm while rinsing the strap in super hot water with the other, bending like a contortionist not to soak the whole thing.Seriously, no one should have to go through that for cleaning straps! At least the top 5 straps (the ones you're LO chews on and drops food on) should be removable!Without the pros above, this would be a one-star review. So be warned... and be ready for serious cleaning ingenuity...",4
1578,"This is really the best high chair. So versatile. It reclines for newborns, so they can be close while you're in the kitchen. It sits up when they're ready to eat, and turns into a booster when they're a toddler. Cover is washable and after using it with two kids who have had it covered with about everything you can imagine it's still stain-free, I even take the safety straps and put them in a delicates bag and run them through the wash, too. I always hang-dry both cover and straps.",5
1579,"We now own 2 of these chairs as couldn't think of anything better for our second daughter. Our kitchen table has bar height chairs so a regular high chair isn't high enough for them to be at the correct level. The tray is easy to clip on and remove while also being easy to wipe clean. Other reviewers have complained that it does not fit in their dishwasher. We have not experienced this problem but as our girls aren't particularly messy, we usually wipe clean with an antibacterial cloth. The adjustable straps are excellent, the 5 point harness is very secure and the seat is very solid.",5
1580,"At first I was unsure of this high chair I really wanted a standing one, but after having it for several months and now going onto over year I am really glad that this is the one that I have.Pros:- Fits on any dining chair and has straps around the back and bottom to keep it tight- Travels easily, we have taken this chair on trips with us and doesn't take up much space- Easy to clean up- Multiple positions. You can recline the back and then change it to a booster seat as they get older- Washable fabric- Unescapable; my mother in law has a standing high chair and my little one is able to climb out of it; with this one she is unable to escape from the high chair.- Removable bucklesCons:- The tray washes very easily; but I found that if you are eating pasta and have a red sauce it stains the tray. It takes several washings for it to come completely out. At first I worried that I would have a stained tray but eventually it would go back to the white.- Don't always realize that food gets into the buckle holes and when you go to wash it (I am always throwing it into the wash) that there is food stuck to the bottom.Overall this is a wonderful high chair, it is easy to move around and my little one loves sitting in it. Even though the pasta sauce does stain it, it eventually comes out and I can overlook that aspect of it. If you are looking for a high chair that doesn't take up a lot of space this would be a very good option for you.",5
1581,"My little guy was a preemie and at 9 months is only 15 lbs 25.5 inches long.  This chair fits him very well and has for several months.  I love that it has three reclining positions.  It's a good quality high chair.",5
1582,"We have a Davinci alfa portable rocking crib. This works perfectly, fits exactly as it should. Prevented baby from getting his arms and legs stuck and protected his head. The mesh is totally breathable and it's surprisingly padded!",4
1583,"These are great.  My granddaughter loves them.  I just wish my puppy didn't like them so much.  I'm making MAM rich.",5
1584,"I got this for Grandma on mother's day and she loved it. Proclaimed it the best gift of the day even above the Michael Korr purse she asked for :) Just make sure to do it when baby is sleeping. Although it is easy to redo if you mess up by adding a little water and re-rolling the clay. Having 2 people really helps.",5
1585,"I originally purchased this as a gift and loved it so much I bought myself one. Easy to do and the more it dries the better it looks. Try to do it when the baby's asleep if you are using it during the first few months when the baby keeps his fist tightly closed. Having 2 people, patience, and a little water will help.",5
1586,"This was the most helpful product at reducing my son's cradle cap. We would gently scrub with this using the special shampoo and I found it really help break up flakes.",5
1587,"Well, I can't speak to it's cradle cap-busting abilities because my daughter never had cradle cap, but I used this brush religiously when I shampooed her hair and hey, maybe that's why she never had it?  It did seem to remove dead skin well and though she was left with some dandruff the first 24 hrs after a bath, she never got he cap.  And who knows if that was just the fact that she was getting shampooed.This brush is sturdy and well built.  The bristles stand up well and don't matt.  They even hold up to my daughter's teething from time to time.  I don't use the cap to it but that's nice for travel and for not getting dog hair in it... hey, maybe I should use it after all.  This would be a great registry idea or baby shower idea.  I've nannied toddlers whom their mother still use this brush for their hair so it's not just for infancy.",5
1588,"My son had a moderate case of cradle cap and I'd tried all of the traditional remedies with oil and baking soda, etc...so I decided to buy a brush. I used this one time in conjunction with coconut oil and every particle and every flake is gone! So worth the $5 lol.",5
1589,"This toy seems to be decent quality offering several developmentally appropriate features that may interest your baby. The contrasting colors, sound, and different textures are all interesting to babies. Its small and easily portable for entertainment on the go. My 4 month old seems to enjoy it :-)",5
1590,"My 3-month old son is drawn to the vivid colors/contrasts of this rattle. We use the rattle to exercise his eye movement, to draw his focus during tummy time, and to teach him how to use his little hands to grasp and hold onto an object. We like that the rattle also introduces babies to differenct textures and shapes.",5
1591,"They're cute but why would anyone make a burp cloth with a side that's non-absorbent? The absorbent side isn't THAT absorbent, either! I use these for ship, the cheap white cotton ones are still my go to.",2
1592,"These are a necessity, I recommend these for any newborn. They are very nice with a great print, will handle lots of use",5
1593,"My nine month old loves this. I like that it's free of BPA, phthalates, and all that. It's nice that you can pop it in the freezer to chill it for teething babies. Also, the peel handles make it easy for baby to hold or to throw a pacifier strap around to clip to baby's shirt, since there's nothing she loves more than dropping all of her toys on the floor.",5
1594,"This brush seems to work fine. Our baby enjoys holding on to the banana peel handles when we're not using it. The bristles and the banana are a nice soft rubber.",4
1595,"This was a wonderful toothbrush when they first start getting teeth.  I would use again, but you will need to switch as they start getting a mouthful of teeth.  Great for them to chew on too.",5
1596,"Ohh if your son is teething this piece is the right thing to buy... I started brushing gently,, he loved it... he opened his mouth wider and was smiling.. he definitely thinks this is some kind of game and was amused by it.What better review can you have than a 9 mo old smile with joy after using a product... Love it!!",5
1597,"Our baby LOVES this. Even before she could &#34;work&#34; most teething aids, she could use this one. The handles are the perfect shape, size - and apparently consistency for independent chewing and relief. Very happy with our purchase and have also bought these now for friends. Oh - and seriously they are hilarious.",5
1598,"I received a completely different product with packaging that say made in Hong Kong! And the banana was only yellow. Not white and yellow like the photo.",1
1599,"Very rubbery.  Not as big as it looks in the picture on Amazon (which is a good thing).  My granddaughter loves it.",5
1600,"My son loves it when I &#34;brush&#34; his two little teeth with this training toothbrush. Why the 3 stars then? Because the item is not as shown in the picture. The one they sent me is not white and yellow like you see in the picture. The one that came is all one yellow color. It isn't as cute as the one in the picture. It is still a great little training brush but it just bugs the crap out of me when these sellers don't accurately portray their products. How hard is it to post an accurate picture?",3
1601,"The bristles are soft, so it doesn't hurt my daughter's already swollen gums from teething. the banana peels aren't just for decoration. they prevent the &#34;One who Swallows All Things&#34; from sticking the toothbrush further into her mouth than she should. The peels spread out wide enough to make it safe from accidental insertion.",5
1602,"My baby loves this teether and has loved it for months now.  The soft rubber bristles feel good on her gums and sometimes she chews on the &#34;peel&#34; as well.  Easy to wash and have around.  I also sometimes clip it to her baby rings to keep it convenient on her carseat.  All in all, cute teether that's very functional.  Great baby gift!",5
1603,"We broke these out when my son got his first 2 teeth.  For a good month or 2, woe was us if we went anywhere without one.  He still loves them for teething.  We haven't tried real brushing yet.",5
1604,"Very soft, it is a suitable for baby toothbrush, although there is no use, but believe that he will like it",5
1605,"Babies love it!",5
1606,"This is a great toothbrush and teether.  I like the handles for baby to grasp, large but not too large.  The teether portion is about the right size for baby to gnaw on when cutting teeth without gagging themselves (you know how they shove anything into their mouths, only to find out they'll gag.) This works pretty well.",5
1607,"No idea why babies like it so much, but mine LOVES it. Small enough to grab, fun to chew, and adorable to watch. Win!",5
1608,"Now that my son has six teeth, we use a regular toothbrush twice a day.  However, he LOVES this one and it is his toy he gets to chew on during diaper changes.",5
1609,"We have a very narrow staircase (22&#34;) so had to go with a retractable gate.  This was a little harder to install than i'd hoped (came with many more pieces than required, which added confusion). We ended up using a piece of 2X4 tied to our banister to make it work. It's not pretty, but it's functional.  We're using it at the bottom of the stairs to prevent our 14 month old from climbing up.  Takes some practice to open it one-handed.",3
1610,"I loved the look and the quality is fine but this is not safe to use. I bought a variety of stools because I have twins and three bathrooms. This has a smaller width and length than other stools so it tips easily. They may not slide off of it but the whole darn thing is going to tip over at the drop of a hat. We have been lucky they have not hurt themselves significantly. I have it on a flat non carpeted surface so it isn't due to uneven surfaces. I would not recommend this one bit. I am not even going to sell it at a garage sale because I would not want to endanger another child.",1
1611,"These are great bibs to use while eating out or on-the-go. We used to bring our bibs and then pack them in ziplock to take home. These fit the bill perfectly. The backing is touch and go but for the most part it stays. The food catcher is decent so no complaints.",3
1612,"We bought these to use for our 7 month old when we went on vacation last month.  They were pretty much useless to us.  The baby was able to rip them right off her neck as soon as we put them on her.  Now we have a box of worthless, half used bibs sitting in our closet.",1
1613,"these r great for travelling with your messy little 1 they r easy to store n soft so they don't take up space in baby bags.they attach with a sticky tape around the neck so easy to put on n take off. n they come in handy. n the best part u just throw them away when your done no worrying about stains afterwards.",4
1614,"This is a really great little product. We travel often and finding a rest stop, let alone a clean rest stop is not always easy. We have a little one who is potty training and this is a great solution. It folds up so it fits right up front on the floor. Pops open real easy, and best of all... You don't have to purchase their bags. Any gallon size fits perfect. We like the side storage for wet wipes and extra bags. A friend borrowed it for a trip. She has a little boy. Previous comment state you have to make sure to tuck. She confirmed, tuck or there will be a mess. I have a girl so haven't had any issues. Keep in mind it is not a full size potty. It is small for easy travel. We had no leaking, missing, or messes made. We love it.",5
1615,"I'm usually happy with Fisher Price but this chair definitely needs some changes - after I used it for some period of time I'd say I'd buy one which would have some place for the tray - I really do not know where to put it (usually on the table, chair, floor..) when I take the baby out of the chair - you can take the baby out WITH the tray - but you know kids.. they are shouting and do not like to be fixed there. The same story is when you put the kid inside- it's easier WITHOUT that tray. And, THE STORY WITH LEGS.. I don't understand - if the seat is adjustable- WHY that thing for legs doesn't move, offffffff. it's a pity.The good things are: it's washable, it's bright and really looks and feels safe. ;))",4
1616,"We got this chair as a baby registry item. Glad I did. First started using when my daughter was around 5-6 months old. I like that we can adjust the height, but we actually don't use that feature too much. The recline is perhaps the feature I used the least amount. I thought I would have used it more when my daughter was not yet on solids, but I didn't. I like that it's on wheels and that feature is used actually a lot. We wheel it to the kitchen when I am cooking and need to watch my daughter, we occupy her with some toys or coloring books or books to read. Once we are ready for dinner, we want her to be part of the dinner table. We use this chair for breakfast, lunch and dinner, along with both snack times. It allows her to focus on her meal. I don't think the cleaning is too bad. We also have a chicco hook on chair which hooks onto a table which good, but found that this high chair is more comfortable and secure for my daughter. We use the hook on when we go out, eat at a friend's or family member's home. I am glad I received  this but do believe that there may be others on the market that could do the job for a lower price. My daughter is 22 months old and I expect to use this until she grows out of it.",4
1617,"I bought two of these for my kid's toys they were so easy to put together total ten minutes for both, color is not deep brown but it still looks very cute not very big but it can hold a lot. Can have multiple uses of storage from arts and crafts, sewing to a cute side table at your bed for a newborn dresser the possibilities are endless I will defiantly be purchasing more.",5
1618,"These really work for our baby-no leaks and last straight through most nights. Can hold a lot of urine.",5
1619,"I needed something to help get my daughters's stuffed animals organized. It was easy to install using a hook and the stuffed animals have stayed on with no issues. It looks cute too.",4
1620,"This is a great size that is easy for me to hold and use, and for baby, also.  The bristles are soft, and it's nice that it comes with a comb, too.  Great product and price.",5
1621,"Very good item for it's cheap price.I like using the brush on my 8 month old. Sometimes she cries when I brush her hair, but I don't think it's because of the brush. The brush is pretty soft. Didn't try the comb yet.",4
1622,"We needed a few more nipples after buying the starter kit!  This made it easier to sanitize and have enough for feedings",5
1623,"These nipples work great for breastmilk but that's about it! The nipple hole is too small to handle formula or anything with rice cereal added because it gets clogged. We switched the the medium flow to prevent this and they flow too fast...dr browns work better.",3
1624,"but that's probably why it does such a good job.  Oh well, they won't be crawling, pulling up and toppling forever.  I would buy again.",4
1625,"These are excellent for protecting your little one from sharp corners. They are super easy to install (stick them on) and they stay put.",5
1626,"We bought these when our daughter started to walk at 9.5 months and have found two issues.1. Stickiness - our daughter has repeatedly been able to pull these off the table corners and window sill corners. We also tried some stronger 3M double sided tape however our daughter has managed to figure out how to pull them off. Unless we use some superglue then we're unable to keep these attached.2. The foam is soft enough for our daughter to chew bits off. Even if non-toxic that is not ideal.A good idea, however it doesn't work in our situation with our daughter. Others may have better luck, it may also depend on the surface to which you are trying to attach them.",2
1627,"stick pretty well, fits well, would seem to protect any injury if someone were to fall against the corners. definitely recommend",5
1628,"Loved turning my bottles into jars for pumping right into them.This thing is making me type more and I have nothing else more to say. Stupid.",5
1629,"This is a good travel stroller, I'm very happy with the weight and ease of folding and unfolding.  The wheels are a little cheap and won't last me too long (I live in Europe where the sidewalks aren't always great).  I'm hoping I can buy new wheels once these ones break.",4
1630,"Perfect for daily light use stroller. Love the tray for toddler and cup holder for parents. Very light easy to open and fold it.",5
1631,"Great stroller for the money.  The only problem is that you can;t adjust the back of the seat to have the babies straight up.  Other than that, a good stroller.  Easy to open and close.",4
1632,"So I have been using this bag for some time now and it is still holding up good despite the amount of stuff I ram into it. In the front (cooler section) I carry 6 small (3 scoops each) formula containers and 2 bottles. In the main section of the bag it holds 3 sets of clothing (bodysuit, pants and vest), 3 burp cloths, I small blanket, 6 diapers, small bottle of baby powder, 3 sets of small take along toys, 2 changing pads (the one that came with the bag and one I made) and on beach outings it also holds another blanket and a medium sized baby towel. There are 3 small elasticated pockets inside the main section in which I carry 3 pairs of socks, 4 folded paper towels and small baby wash and cream. In the back pocket I carry the baby wipes. In the side pockets I carry an umbrella and hand soap, hand sanitizer and hand cream. It is easy to carry. Would definitely recommend.",5
1633,"I couldn't believe I was spending so much money on friggin spoons...but wow were they worth the money! The silicone is super soft so it feels good on baby gums, and the handle is long and is so comfortable for the feeder. I thought I was crazy for liking a spoon so much, but everyone who uses them (nanny, grandparents, etc.) makes a comment about how nice they are!",5
1634,"This is my second order of these and although they are pricey they are seriously worth it.  We love that the silicone is safer for LO and he loves them too!  He uses them as tethers when he isn't eating with them.  They are the only spoon we use now.  I wish Id gotten these from the start!",5
1635,"Purchased as a gift, very soft and thick. Very good quality we will be gifting more of these in the future.",5
1636,"My baby has bad reflux and spits up constantly. I have about 8 of these burpy bibs and love how LARGE they are-they cover my entire shoulder! when used as a bib, it looks kind of ridiculous on my 4 month old baby because it looks like a cape, but it also provides great protection from drool and spit up BECAUSE it is so large!I also have a ton of the snap bibs by Aden + Anais, and love those as well, but I have no clue why everyone keeps saying that these muslin bibs get &#34;softer with every wash.&#34; Mine aren't exactly soft (not rough, but not super soft either), and I don't know if it's because I don't dry them with dryer sheets.",4
1637,"I really can't rave about these enough. We adore these so much that we purchased more of them. If they weren't so expensive, they would be the only burp rags I would use. My little one spit up like crazy when he was really little and these did a better job than anything else of catching it. They are thick enough that he could spit up over and over again and it would still absorb the spit up.The other great feature is that they snap around the neck. Whenever we needed baby to stay clean and dry, we would snap one of these around his neck when we put him in his car seat and he would stay clean until the bib was either drenched or we took it off of him.Great baby shower gift. They have become my go to gift. Really so amazing. They seem expensive but they are a great investment. Super versatile and, when you factor in how much they absorb, they're worth it. I would go through 4-5 of any other burp rag in the same amount of time I would use just 1 of these. I have loved every product I have purchased from aden + anais.",5
1638,"True to Aden + Anais form, these are super soft bibs, that work well as burp cloths (as the snap is small and does not get in the way of burp cloth functionality).We purchased them mainly for the bib function.  They would not worked well for my first son, who is Mr. Messy when he eats and needs the &#34;catcher&#34; feature to grab the spills.  Son #2 is a little cleaner and just needs something with coverage ( he doesn't drop food as often).  I highly recommend!",5
1639,"Really love them, they are very nice, i love them, they are big so they are better than any other snap bib. thanks",5
1640,"I have been using these as burp rags for my youngest. Formula washes off them effortlessly. Now as we've started to transition to food, they are great bibs. They offer wonderful coverage. Even orange stains from carrots and squash and green stains from veggies wash out without leaving anything behind. The fabric has become a little wrinkly over time, but I expected that. They are still incredibly soft.",5
1641,"The quality of these aden + anais products are great. I do not like baby washcloths that are so soft and thin that they are just flimsy to try use. These are amazing!",5
1642,"Reading through the description of this product and its various reviews led me to believe these earmuffs would work well for infants. I purchased this for my 5 1/2 month old for when we attend the fireworks at the 4th of July.  They're big on his head, but cover his ears well and seem to stay put. Even though the fit isn't perfect, they'll get the job done. They squish his cheeks in slightly, but not so much that he is uncomfortable. (It's also kind of adorable, so I can't complain there!) The package itself states they're designed for children ages 2 to 10. I think this is a great product, but I wish the sizing information was clearly stated in the product description. That is the reason I knocked off a star for my review.I also purchased a second pair in a different color for my daughter. She is a couple months shy of turning 2. They fit her much better. The snug fit was still maintained on her larger head, which my husband and I appreciate because it means she still needs help to take them off. This will keep her from fiddling with them during the fireworks. After trying them on her I know they block sound well. She was having fun exploring sounds that were coming through muffled, which is different from how she normally hears them. The excited faces she made let us know she was comfortable and happy with her new earmuffs.",4
1643,"Love the color the ease of storage, and the noise protection my son gets. Bought to use so he could cut the grass with his daddy. Will be great for the fourth of July or any loud event. Fit my 21month old with room to grow.",5
1644,"I want to love this but I find that the plastic is kind of cheap for the price it is selling at.  The bulb portion is awkward to twist open to clean, I am afraid I will break it because it is so thin.  The mesh carrying sac is great but it doesn't keep the mouthpiece clean so I am not sure why it would be useful.  If they made it sturdier with a rubberized bulb grip that would make things so much easier.It would be worth it if it was priced at $5.",3
1645,"ordered this after a friend told me that the regular nasal aspirators get filled with mold on the insides because they can't be cleaned well.  Gross!  This to me was a good option because you use a clean tissue as the &#34;filter&#34; (unlike the Nose Frida, where you have to buy additional filters).  This thing works WAY better than the regular nose aspirator I had from the hospital!  I love it.  Easy to clean, easy to use, baby doesn't seem to mind it as much and actually laughs when I use it.  Very, very good product.  Would definitely recommend.",5
1646,"This is a great product to keep my tv secured to the wall to prevent my twins and my kitty from knocking it over, however as many others have noted, the screws are no where near long enough for my Samsung LED TV.  I figured that since it was a new TV, that it would be a standard dimension and work with the included screws, but I was wrong.",3
1647,"We have our TV stand and Large screen tv gated off however we installed the straps as a precautionary for our twins. They were easy to install",4
1648,"Cribs such as this from the parent company Million Dollar Baby supposedly don't have off-gassing of VOC's like some other cribs, but is still reasonably priced (I found it for $140 on sale). That is what initially attracted me to this model. We have now had it for 6 months and have been very happy with it so far. It was extremely easy to put together, is sturdy and well-made, and quite attractive. In fact, I think it looks better in person than online.",5
1649,"Hurray for reading while I pump 3x day, 5 days a week! Nice fit, comfy, love that it goes over the bra I'm already wearing.",5
1650,"I tried to use these they just kept slipping down or bunching up in the cloth diaper bought two boxes one for me ad a friend neither one of us liked or even finished the box",2
1651,"Purchased as a gift, seems to be well made and it is a great price for a baby mobile for a boy or girl.",5
1652,"I was hoping this would clip onto the side of my pack and play but every time I attached the mobile it would fall over. Needless to say I returned this product.",2
1653,"I love the bright white color and non-scratching design but I was disappointed that it wouldn't hold the mobile I bought.  It wouldn't hold it at all.  Unless you're buying a very light weight mobile I would skip this mobile arm and buy a more expensive one.",3
1654,"Not sure why people are complaining about the arm being too shirt. I have mine attached to the side of the crib with the mattress at the highest setting and my 2-month-old can't reach it. Sometimes he can reach it with his feet if he kicks up really high but that's about it.  One review mentioned that it's too low for the changing table - that's true, but this is being advertised specifically as a crib mobile and it does what it says.",5
1655,"The concept was great, and I love the fact that they are not potential projectiile risks in an accident (like the suction cup sunshades)....however, they do NOT stay on your windshield at all, especially in weather warmer than 75 degrees. I live in Southern California where it is always sunny and needed to shade my daughter when the sun hits the back windshield at a certain time during the day. THey work well when they actually stay on the windshield, but they inevitably start to peel off, which is incredibly annoying. What is more annoying is that it is also very difficult to apply this onto your windshield in a smooth fashion-there are bubbles that I can't avoid, and unless i had anothe rperson helping me, I don't see myself being able to attach this thing without bubbles and smoothing it out on my own. I wish they would make it so that it clings to your windshield better, but I guess that's why the price is so low....you kinda get what you pay for.",2
1656,"They became malformed and wonky after the first use. Closer inspection revealed these &#34;bath toys&#34; come with a tag noting they can't be submerged in water. Ridiculous.",1
1657,"I always have to throw these out after a few months because the water never really empties out to become moldy inside so the price is good enough for me to throw out after a couple months",5
1658,"This fits well on our &#34;pub&#34; height chairs and still goes under the matching table. This wipes clean easily, plastic doesn't stain. I only wish the straps were grey or beige to hide stains better. It's possible to remove and wash them, but it's kind of tedious.",4
1659,"Really like this booster seat.  The main pluses are the adjustable back, low front to go under my table edge, and the wide seat pan.  Holds firm in place with back and bottom chair strap.  Front buckle can be finicky but still pretty easy to use.",5
1660,"This is nearly the perfect booster seat for my 3 year old.  He loves his &#34;big boy&#34; seat at the kitchen table and I like the adjustable back.  My *only* reason that it was not a 5 star is because we have cushioned seats and it really leaves a dent in the cushion.  I'd recommend putting card board or some sort of protection to save your kitchen chairs.",4
1661,"We bought this as a base for a second car.  Fit our Safety 1st onBoard 35 Air car seat perfectly.",5
1662,"This fit our OnBoard 35 car seat great. It's easy to install and move from car to car if needed. We got it for our second car and for when grandparents babysit - so far after 6 weeks of use we've have no problems!",5
1663,"The sheet is gorgeous and fits the theme of my nursery but it's just too small. After one wash, it causes the pack n play mattress to buckle drastically. I actually like it now because my little guy can't lay flat after eating without regurgitating,but it's provoking when hubby puts him in upside down or trying to change his diaper because it's not a straight incline, there are ridges and lumps everywhere! For the money, I'dve expected a bit more stretch but I guess this goes to show that one size does not necessarily, always, fit all...",3
1664,"I really like this fitted sheet for our graco pack n play.  It is very soft and seems durable.",5
1665,"This is the perfect addition to our little guys room. It ended up matching perfectly to our bedding we had got for him - the Carter's Forest Friends. Nice and soft too",5
1666,"Love these. They are absorbant, truely waterproof and wash up well! I think these are a must have for all parents! I have them in different sizes too. I have some for the crib, the play pen and the bassinet!",5
1667,"These work well to keep my child's mattress dry when they have middle of the night accidents and pee the bed. These are a mattress saver! I use them on twin-sized mattresses and a toddler bed.",5
1668,"The amazon description and reviews weren't very clear about this product.  I was very confused when purchasing because I wasn't sure if this was truly a &#34;crib&#34; pad that it covered the entire crib mattress.  The title is very misleading.  It is actually much smaller than a crib mattress.  It is about the size of a changing pad.  I used it to cover my changing pad.",3
1669,"I just received this pad, which sounded too good to be true, and IT IS! Of course 100% flannel would not be waterproof. There is a vinyl liner between the flannel layers. So this is NOT 100% cotton! The box says ""fabric: 100% cotton"" but does not mention anything about the plastic liner, which is entirely meant to mislead.Here is the note from manufacturer upon my inquiry: ""If it is a waterproof pad, it will have a vinyl liner in the middle, covered by 100% cotton so that the cotton is the only material coming into contact with your child.""So this will outgas.On another note, the retailer was grand and gave me a refund on the item without any hassle at all. However, I am reviewing the item here, not the retailer.",1
1670,"These definitely do the job of keeping things dry.  We've only had to switch out our changing pad cover once when the baby spit up on it because we didn't have a pad under her head, just her butt.  These also wash well if you follow the directions on the tags.",5
1671,"I just received these lap pads. I have not had a chance to use them, but I have washed and dried them and can say that worked out well. They are much smaller than I expected. I probably should have looked at the measurements. I wanted to use them on top of the changing pad, but I am not quite sure they will be big enough. I will try that and use them as shoulder burp cloths as well. I will update in the future as to the results.",4
1672,"I have 4 of the bassinet size, 8 of the smaller lap pad size, and 2 of the full crib size. Honestly, I could use twice that many so I'd have some on each level of my home and in the car. Put them down on everything before baby!My sister gave me her used Toys R Us brand pads and I absolutely prefer the Carter's.  The few nights before I had my son I slept on the crib size pads just in case my water broke, the Carter's pad was barely noticeable while the Toys pad made me sweaty/sticky/itchy just like sleeping on plain plastic would. I'm sure baby would be uncomfortable too, but not with the Carter's pads.",5
1673,"I was preparing for my first baby and this was on one of those &#34;lists&#34; other moms make to tell you what you will need. I must say that it is a super necessity! I bought 5 and still can use more. Diapers leak (even the best of the best) and accidents happen during changes.I use them:- inbetween the crib sheets and mattress- inbetween the changing pad and changing pad cover- inbetween my bed and bedsheets (if I know I will have baby on my bed)- travel pad to sit her on other folks and my own furniture or laps- and other surfaces as a germ barrier or for liquid spills or spit upsThey haven't leaked through for urine or bottle formula spills and are super washable. The texture is soft, too. I will buy these for shower gifts for any future friends/family I know that are expecting!!",5
1674,"what can you say, its a pad and so far it seems to work . fits the bassinet just right.",5
1675,"I use this in a wipes warmer with my wipes. Has a nice smell to it and works really great with my wipes/warmer.",5
1676,"Wish I had known about these awesome bags when my son was new born. I cringe when I think of how many ziplock bags and other plastic bags I used carting soiled clothes home in! This is such a great idea whether you cloth diaper or not. Now that my son is a bit older, his clothes aren't ruined quite as often, so we use this to pack his wet bathing suit home. On the rare occasion that he does mess up his clothes, it's so easy to pack them in this bag and toss the bag into the diaper bag. Can see using this often during the potty training phase as well.",5
1677,"I love planet wise products, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is I really don't like how the liner and outer cover aren't sewn together and you have to stuff it back in when it dries. This seems like a minor annoyance but it takes some fiddling around to make it even and straight. Overall though, it is the best wet bag I own and I love that it has two separate sections. Sometimes I just use it as my entire diaper bag on short trips.",4
1678,"Friends warned me against purchasing this product, and as a new mom, I didn't listen.  I am glad it wasn't very expensive, because after a few failed attempts to use it to suction my new baby's nose, I tossed it in the trash can.",1
1679,"I have no problem recommending it to other buyers as it is a very good product, and helps to transport drinking water",5
1680,"I would have bought Klean Kanteen but wanted a straw option for my still nursing toddler. This was a great travel option. Does not leak, doesn't dent when thrown, keeps drinks cold for hours. It is on the heavier side. I have since bought more in the funtainer model because this one doesn't fit in stroller cup holders.",4
1681,"Bought this to use as an insulated straw cup for milk for my baby.  It works well, you can use the handles from the foogo sippy cup on it, and the straw is easy to use but unless the cap is clicked down, milk leaks out the straw.  I'm keeping it because it's the only insulated stainless steel straw cup I could find, but wish it wouldn't leak out the straw if the cap isn't closed.",3
1682,"I was impressed of how this bottle keeps the heat. I bought this for my daughter to bring to her daycare center. I am amazed that the bottle retains the heat for at least 6 hours!However, the design of this boring.

1683,"I love that the lid closes and keeps the straw clean. My daughter is almost two and we have moved away from sippy cups, but didn't have a more grown up option in place yet. She really loves this. I hope it holds up! If it does, we'll be buying more.",4
1684,"We bought this thermos for our 16 month old toddler so she could have cold milk while we traveled at airports, or just whenever we were out of the house for hours at a time. It's proven to be an essential in our diaper bag, and has worked well without any spills or other complaints thereof. The quality of the thermos is great.The only downsides are having to clean the straw, and possibly having to replace the entire thermos down the road because of wear and tear on the straw. Do clean the straw with a pipe cleaner of some sort to avoid any buildup, especially if this thermos is used for anything other than water. Also, be watch fil of your tot -- mine tends to have a bit of a chew on the straw after she's done sipping, and that obviously wears down the material faster than we'd like!",4
1685,"The straw bottle is very good. Easy clean, easy to use, keep fresh for a long time. And it is a little heavier than regular straw bottle, so I just use it to serve water, not for milk.",5

1687,"Oh those first couple weeks- the leaking!  No nursing pad was helping!  I finally ordered these and wish I had before the baby was born!  There is a learning curve with them (keep the little hole up top and watch out if you bend over!) but they were awesome for wearing around the house.  I collected quite a bit of milk.  I only used them for about 3 1/2 weeks while my body regulated milk production.  They were awesome and I would get them again in a second!",5
1688,"My nipples are rather large. For reference, I use the 30mm flanges with my breast pump. The holes on this product are too small for my nipples and actually cause more hurt, espeically because the plastic is so hard. Additionally, there is only one venting hole, so I kept getting condensation inside the cup, which seems to conducive to breeding bacteria.",1
1689,"I actually ended up buying this booster seat again for my husbands car thats how much we loved it!We have 3 kids and a full size sedan, All three of our kids are in some sort of a booster seat or infant car seat. Needless to say we needed to make sure that all our child safety seats could fit. THis booster was the smallest in width that I was able to find and one of the few booster seats without a cup holder! I never realized how hard it could be to find a seat with out one now a days.Its a little funny how you install it but as long as you follow the instructions your good. FYI if your car does not a latch at the top of the headrest you will not be able to use this car seat!",5
1690,"These are not just great for swaddling but for placing on car seat or swing, keeps the new baby nice and cool.No sign of wear after scores of washes.",5
1691,"I love these swaddling wraps. They are so nice because you can use it as a blankie/swaddle, as a nursing cover, a car seat/stroller cover, and as a burp rag. They have cute prints too. I have them for my newborn but my two year old loves then too. He had them when he was little but now he has the stroller blanket that has two layers.",5
1692,"I love these blankets. In the beginning we used them to swaddle our son--they are the perfect size and material for that.  Now we use them as regular blankets in the crib and stroller.  Because they are light, they are great for the summer",5
1693,"These blankets were an excellent size and were extremely useful for swaddling as the little one as he continues to grow bigger and bigger. They are a great weight and very breathable, so the little ones don't get too hot when swaddled up.",5
1694,"As a first time mother, I thought I didn't need to purchase these swaddlers - I had so many blankets and the price seemed high for four blankets, so I chose not to purchase these when I closed out my registry.  Shortly after having my baby I went back and purchased these.  We swaddle our baby every night and she's a great sleeper as a result.  These swaddlers are large enough that I know I'll be able to continue to use them as she grows.  They are high quality and the material is extremely breathable while still being warm.  I highly recommend.  Pass on the $12 useless pack of receiving blankets and purchase these instead.",5
1695,"These are wonderful blankets. My son does not love to be swaddled but these are great summer blankets for multiple purposes.",5
1696,"Very nice, i love them, they are perfect, i will buy more of this ones! thanks for all! Buy them",5
1697,"These are perfect for warm weather places. Used them for my daughter when she was little as a swaddle and now use them as a light blanket in the car and airplane.",5
1698,"We loved these swaddling blankets for our son. He had horrible colic for months when he was born. One of the only times he'd moderately calm down and stop screaming (other than when eating or asleep) was with a really tight swaddle from these blankets. if we have another baby, this is a guaranteed purchase.",4
1699,"I loved these swaddling blankets when my son was younger and they have many uses as your child continues to grow! The quality is great and they're a nice size to pack and bring with you on the go.",5
1700,"I really wanted to love this.  But I can't.  It comes rolled up which I get, but then won't lay flat.  I've left it flat with books on top of it for a few days and it seems to help.  THEN you have the issues where the suction cups don't actually work on any surface that isn't completely smooth.  We have a wood table and it just doesn't stick well.  Which renders it useless with a 10 month old who flaps around a lot!",1
1701,"These are the best bottles!  I cannot say enough about them and how helpful they are for baby's tummy!  My little boy has used since 6 months after EBF and he had no problems at all!  Love MAM",5
1702,"My daughter loves this toothbrush. She is one and can grip it well on her own. She reaches for it all the time.",5
1703,"Used this as a teether for my son. Once his teeth broke through we worked on brushing our teeth and the little brush head was perfect for his tiny teeth, while the gummy end was great for soothing his gums. I got blue, but would not have cared what color I received.",5
1704,"No leaks so far and I've probably used about 75 bags.  Note that the ounce measurements are NOT accurate, which is why it got 4 stars from me.  I use the measurement from the pump bottle and then write it on the bag.  I think you'd probably get this with any bag since it's shaped differently than a bottle and it holds air differently.",4
1705,"These bags are very good. Convenient, durable, well made and don't leak. Love the double zipper. I also used the Lansinoh bags and these are far better. I definitely recommend them.",5
1706,"These are great bags, they don't bend over when I'm pouring even when I'm pouring heavy handed and they stand up almost even with unfrozen milk in them. I haven't had any issues with leakage in my freezer and they are totally easy to label (even if you forget and label them AFTER the milk's in the bag!). My MIL says they thaw easily and even if the bag tips over in the bowl, no water penetrates. Great buy!",5
1707,"Bags stores milk well, doesn't seem to leak much. However, it does not have the white prining so I can write with pens, it does write well with sharpies.  Also, it doesn't seem to freeze as flat as the lansinoh bags but the bags itself are thicker.",4
1708,"I have to say that I found no leaking at all for the 50 bags. But they have very funky smell when first opened. I guess that's the common problem for plastic bags. So I took them all and hang on the clothes racks for a couple of days. Still smells bad, but better.",3
1709,"We have found that these bags are the best value for the price. They also work really well. They seal great and freeze and defrost really easily. They are very durable and I have never had an issue with leakage.",5
1710,"Great product but my son wasn't into them. I think we introduced them too late but it mimics breastfeeding very well. Best pacifier I've seen out there.",4
1711,"These sometimes sprayed my daughter when the suction got caught (or something happened??) I know some people that like them but I wasn't a huge fan.",3
1712,"great for toddlers learning to feed themselves with utensils. My 17 month old daughter won't eat dinner wont eat a meal without a fork and/or spoon now :)",5
1713,"after we had our first baby we tried every single utensil out there once he was interested, we landed on these as our favorites (the Oxo Tots are wonderful as well and run a very close second, our favorite for spoons though)now that we have 2 kids using little utensils they both favor these so we've had to buy a bunch more so we can use them at every meal. it's even better how affordable these are.highly recommend them if you have little ones just starting to use utensils all the way through the toddler years.",5
1714,"These weren't what i expected....The moment they arrived i knew i would return them as they were too big for my son to use and i find them not toddler friendly with all that shiny metal at the tip. I might as well as give him an adult fork to feed himself.",3
1715,"I bought this to wear my fourth child, since I knew I would need my hands free to tend to my other kids much of the time. It has not disappointed!  It is comfortable for me to wear, and my baby is so comfy in it.I think that many people are scared off by the moby wrap because it is one very long piece of fabric that you have to wrap yourself, as opposed to some other baby carriers that are already pre- shaped for you and you just take on and off. The moby looks really complicated but it is actually very simple. I watched a couple of YouTube videos online before I tried to do it myself and found it very simple to actually use.  I practiced a few times before actually putting my baby in. I tried some other wraps in the store but I liked the moby best.  I think those other wraps were attempting to give a &#34;pre-wrapped&#34; moby, but when you wrap yourself the fit is perfect and the support is fantastic, as opposed to some of those others pre wrapped wraps.Some advice - I was starting by putting the first part of the wrap around my hips and then wrapping. It worked, but I didn't feel so secure. Now I put the first part around my waist. The baby sits higher that way and the wrap is really secure.As far as looks, I got the born free slate, which I find to be very attractive. The color is nice and the butterfly is simple but adds an extra little something. I love that when you are wearing this wrap it kind of looks like you're wearing a tshirt with a baby inside!  The baby is so comfortable and falls asleep almost every time. It is so cuddly to snuggle up like that!The biggest con of this wrap is that even when you get good at it it still takes me 2-3 minutes to put the wrap on and put the baby in. So if I put her in and she is still fussy (because she's hungry or something) I feel kind of bad having to take it off right away after the effort of putting it on.  Some other carriers go on and off quicker.  The other thing that bothers me a little is that the fabric is so long that I cannot put the wrap in without having it drag on the floor as I am putting it on. In my house it's not such a big deal but I don't love the idea of the wrap touching the ground when I am out and about. The good news is that it's the ends that touch the ground, and not the part that touches the baby.All in all, as a first time baby wearer, I highly recommend the moby!  I know people are scared off but it's really not hard to learn!",5
1716,"This diaper pail was shorter than I expected and I was worried I would be going through a lot of bags but I was pleasantly surprised at how much this pail holds. It also holds the stink in VERY well I've used this pail for a year now and I've never had an issue with odors seeping out into my sons room.",5
1717,"I have 4 different kinds of cloth diaper kits these are bulky the biggest ones we own hardly use, least favorite but they never leaked or any surprises out the sides. Good diaper just bulky",3

1719,"My 6 month old loves this activity station.  The keyboard with the pages that flip and create different sounds is her favorite part.  The fact that she has more freedom in it than a regular exersaucer keeps her happier.  I considered getting a walker, but I didn't want to worry about her wondering off too far out of site.  This Bright Starts station keeps her in place and still allows her to move around.It takes up a larger amount of space, but it's well worth it.",5
1720,"We bought this for my mom's house (our daughter's grandmother) and boy does she absolutely love this thing!  The moment she realized she could walk all the way around was hilarious-- she had a huge smile on her face!  I'm not sure how long it will be interesting to her-- we will see!Putting it together was kind of annoying-- it required a magnetic screwdriver (which my mom did not have), so we had to put part of the thing together upside-down utilizing gravity instead of magnets.  I would suggest having a magnetic philips head screwdriver available to put this thing together.",5
1721,"Sturdy and entertaining.  Safe place for baby to play.  Works well for a baby who can sit up but can't yet cruise on his own",5
1722,"So soft and comfortable. My daughter LOVED this and it kept her calm enough to fall asleep. The vibrations are nice, and the music.",5
1723,"I bought this new board to use with my bugaboo cameleon3 and I am really glad I did. I think the reviews on here can be misleading because bugaboo redesigned the board a few years back, and it sounds like some of the reviews are from the old board.  I had the old board too and it was a real pain. This one is much better.1. People complain that you have to walk to the side a little or you will otherwise bump into the board. This is generally true of any buggy board. I don't find it to be too bad with this one, as the newer board is much shorter than the old one so it sticks out less. Also, when I am using the board i extend the handle of the stroller so that I can stand a little further back and push.2. The best improvement about this board is that it is easy to attach and detach whenever you may want. With the old board you needed to turn the stroller upside down to detach it, so you certainly couldn't do that while a child was inside, and it was a real pain to do even without a child inside. This board has two little latches that you can use to simply detach it. I find that it doesn't fold up very well with the bassinet option because the bassinet is so long. So instead i just detach it after I drop my older child off at school and put it in the basket underneath. Then I can walk the rest of the way without bumping into the board!I have used a few different boards for different strollers and I definitely like this one the best.  And when you read reviews please keep in mind that the product changed a while back (I don't know when exactly) so make sure you are reading about the newest model.",5
1724,"We bought two of these to switch out every other day while I washed diapers.  They were wonderful at first, but after a year or so all the lining came out.  I still used them, but they didn't hold in the urine.  A bit pricey for something you might have to buy two or more of every year.",4
1725,"We bought a 13 gallon garbage can with a lip to use as our diaper pail and this fits perfectly! The elastic top clings to the inner rim so that it never falls in and the elastic isn't too bulky so the lid that has a clasp in the front stays closed. We bought another one with a drawstring that has a plastic end to close the bag but the lid of the garbage can never stays closed. Really, there is no need to have the bag close because we take the load from the pail and put it right into the washing machine.This has also been fully waterproof. No leaks for us. Also no residual smell at all and we have been using it for 6 weeks now. Would highly recommend it, especially for the price.",5
1726,"Perfect size, cute print, easily washed and dried. Not a single bad thing to say about it. Does a fantastic job of holding in the smell and keeping the pail itself from getting musty. Very pleased.",5
1727,"I got this for our new baby, my son has one for his diaper and it has worked great for over 2 years. We love the color and it fits in regular trash cans and works great for trips too.",5

1732,"I was super excited to get these for my 15 month old.  I adore cloth diapering and heard good things about these flats.  I was unimpressed with them when they shrunk after washing and drying them the first time out of the package!  I would not recommend them at all.  My flower sack towels from Target work better.  They didn't shrink.",2
1733,"This hat is so cute, and I wanted something for an infant.  Most of the hats are just too big, but this one, while a bit big, still works.  Plus, the soft brim allows him to lay down and still wear it when we're out in the car seat!",4

1735,"My 6 month old daughter loves her mermaid. She got her 2 months ago on Easter and instantly fell in love. She talks and babbles to her whole we ride down the road. She chews on her - the teether fish & the mirror. She loves feeling her hair. I love the crinkling sound in the tail and the rattle in the star fish because I know she is awake while I am driving (I have a severe anxiety about SIDS happening in her car seat or crib). I love that the toy has many bright colors and detaches from the car seat handle easily - not for a baby, I just mean I don't have to wrestle or pry it off. Lamaze wins again!",5
1736,"honestly. this and the giraffe from bright starts. these two car toys and you don't need any of the taggies or the boring kids toys that will ultimately end up wasting your money (totally wasted a few bucks on uninteresting toys, can't you tell?) stick with these two and i promise you, you'll have a happy baby.",5
1737,"My LO loves Captain Calamari.  He smiles and stares at the Captain's face and eagerly chews on each of his legs.  We take the captain everywhere with us because it keeps baby entertained.",5
1738,"I love Lamaze toys in general. I think this company makes high quality and well designed toys and offers them at fair prices. This is how my little one entered the world of toys. We have dee-dee dragon, captan calamari, octopus and various other small soft toys from lamaze. We put them close to my son's bed a few weeks after he was born. You can also attach them to the crib or the stroller using the top white circle which is a plus.It took a month or so for my son to show interest to these colorful toys. This is probably because of the fact that newborns can only see, black-white and red properly until they get a few months old. But after that he really enjoyed playing with this one and the other lamaze toys. There are many different colors and each part feels different to touch (rough, smooth, squeaky or fluffy...) Besides it has a rattle (the purple ball like thing it holds). So it offers audiovisual plus tactile stimulation.For proper brain development, experts recommend offering as many age-appropriate stimulus as you can and that helps smooth integration to the surrounding world too. Apart from the rattle bit and the white circular bit, which is rounded,  there is no hard plastic, so it is very unlikely that a baby can hurt himself while playing with that.It is easy to clean and it should be cleaned often. I have tried surface rubbing with vinegar for routine cleaning and besides that every once in a few months I put it in washing machine (inside a T-shirt or sweater) and I have not experienced any damages at all (I have High efficency machine).There are toys, one would like to keep it as memorabilia of his/her baby's first days, this one can be a good candidate for that spot.",5
1739,"I love this gender neutral print and it works great. I also like that this folds into a bag when you are not using it.",5
1740,"I LOVE this cover. I take it with me everywhere I go with my son. I was given an Eddie Bauer cover for my shower but it didn't work at all! This one will fit al shopping carts including target and publix. It's also really really great for putting over high chairs. It's not complicated AT ALL. Highly recommended.  Best on the market. Worth the extra money.",5
1741,"Haven't put this to use yet, but I'm already getting ready to put all useful things in our car for our new addition, considering how many germs are out there and how many people never washes their hands that touch the carts we shop with...this is a NO brainer!!",4

1746,"I don't have the same problems as others with feet hitting the wheels, but I do hate how small the umbrella on this is. Don't get me wrong, I knew that when I bought it, but I didn't realize just how USELESS it is. I ended up just taking it off. It does not cover any bit of my LO from the sun. My little one is better off with sunblock and a hat on. I also don't find it easy to put ANYTHING in the basket, the bars that crisscross take up so much room. Overall I still like it though.",4
1747,"Excellent value for price. It's an umbrella stroller that works and is sturdy for super cheap. Don't expect the moon and you will not be disappointed.  This one lives at Grandma's for occasional use and is worth every penny.",5

1749,"the perfect umbrella stroller. handles are a nice height (not too short for my 6'2&#34; husband). it's lightweight, good looking, and has places for toys, snacks... so glad we got this for our beach trip. big bang for your buck.",5
1750,"Very happy with this stroller. It folds to almost the size of an umbrella stroller. The only thing I don't like is that there is no cup holder for my son to use. I bought the BRICA Deluxe Snack Pod Stroller Drink and Snack Holder and it works perfectly.",5
1751,"I absolutely love this stroller.  Good compartment size for a lightweight, safe and easily adjustable straps.  Easily steered and my daughter always seems comfortable in it.  Folds very easily, which is great for travel or places like amusement parks where you might have to fold/unfold quickly.  This went to Disney with us and performed beautifully!",5
1752,"I opted to get this one among all others because it said it was lightweight, well, it is! and I like the fact the frame itself is thick and sturdy unlike your traditional umbrella stroller that after a few uses you have to get rid of. Overall we love it and the price was very good too.",5
1753,"I can't say enough about how much I love this stroller.  i love it more than my over $100 stroller.  It folds up nice and small its comfy for my son.  The handles are high enough for my 6'6 husband to push comfortably, unlike those cheap umbrella strollers.  It rolls nicely just like the expensive ones.  I recommend this stroller",5
1754,"I've had this stroller for a couple of years now...it's the last stroller in my house.  Easy to push, even with one hand.  I could use another 3 inches on the back support! LOL!  My 3 yr old loves to nap in this stroller!",5
1755,"light, good quality, sturdy. AWESOME for the subway and those older tots transitioning out of a stroller. Get the $59 one and you'll be happy. the umbrella is quite nice for the price too. The little parent caddy thing on the top is awesome! (esp since you can't get to the basket) and both myself (5 foot 1 and my husband, 5 10"") can push it comfortably without kicking.3 negatives;1. the basket is useless as it's almost impossible to get to.2. the ""recline"" feature is like... 3 inches. (almost nothing.)3. both brakes broke at 6 months of occasional use.",4
1756,"I ordered this stroller based on a recommendation from my friend. It's definitely easy to push and manuever but I somehow expected it to be lighter. It's light but not as light as I thought it would be. One plus for this stroller is the cupholder which makes it very convenient for us or my baby. However, I wish there was 2 holders so that it can hold at least 2 cups, one for the parent and one for the child. The one complaint I have for this stroller is the shade. The shade doesn't really cover my baby from the sun regardless how i maneuver his sitting position. It's sort of flimsy. I expected better coverage from the sun. Despite having the shade out, the sun is still in my son's face. I hope they can make the shade bigger so it can provide more protection against the sun,",4

1759,"Our DK Innovations stroller lost a wheel and it appears they don't make them anymore.  We were heartbroken as 6' and 6'1 parents with shorter 5'7&#34; and 5'6&#34; grandparents. We had lugged that light stroller everywhere with its adjustable handles and light weight.We were facing a trip to Chicago so read reviews (thank you, members!) and decided to plunk down cash for the Minnie Mouse version of this stroller for our size of a 4 year old daughter (who is 2 1/2), thinking it would encourage her to sit in it.I don't have much experience with strollers.  We had the DK which was the go to stroller...and we have a BOB Stoller Strides running stroller, which is like a piece of well oiled machinery but is totally far too heavy, wide, bulky to, say, go to the mall or take on a plane...not to mention much harder for your child to see anything in as they sit more reclined, back further.  But for running, that stroller is amazing.Enter this one.  It was undoubtedly, as many reviewers stated, not a lightweight umbrella stroller as you think of them.  It probably would have been easier lugging this around being the model beneath this one, a few pounds lighter...but we chose this one because of the reclining back, which was used about 10 times in a 4 day trip, and the attaching sun cover, which we needed almost constantly.This stroller is pretty heavy duty-much more well built than I expected based off our DK stroller.  The handles do sit high on it but because of their shape, it's easy for my parents to push her too.The seat base of the stroller doesn't sink around and cup her butt like a normal umbrella stroller--it's much wider and more constructed and looks like it will hold her for many, many years going forward.  Or in the case of my daughter, maybe until she's 4 and 5 feet tall. ;).While not super easy to reach, the storage compartment was a lifesaver at the Lincoln Park Zoo to hold her blankie, snacks, etc. and the beverage tray was a great lifesaver for our water.The one complaint I have about the stroller is where the wheels are positioned, when my daughter fell asleep her feet would fall off the footrest and dangle and catch the wheels.  We would have to &#34;pop a wheelie&#34; with the stroller to get her shoes not to rub against the wheels.  Strangers would spot this, horrified, before we noticed.  On the bright side, apparently it's really comfortable for her to sleep in otherwise!",5
1760,"I needed a stroller that would fit in my trunk, but it also had to be something I could push comfortably (I'm 6' tall).  After a lot of googling and reading reviews, I gave this one a shot because it was one of the few that didn't cost upwards of $200 and seemed like it could accommodate tall babies as well as tall parents.It's all right.  My son doesn't seem to have any complaints, but then again, he doesn't have many words yet.  I have a few minor gripes about it though:- The canopy is not very effective at keeping sun off child.- The mechanism to adjust the recline is annoying (it's pretty much just a drawstring).- Handles are not *quite* tall enough to push comfortably.- There's a cupholder for grownups, but it's flimsy and shallow.- Assembly instructions for putting the wheels on are not the clearest -- make sure you don't put them on upside down, since they're kind of a bitch to remove and put on right-side-up. :&#60;It would also be really nice to have a cupholder for the passenger.  The manual says that &#34;not all models include a cupholder,&#34; which implies that there are some models that DO include a cupholder, but it seems to be a well-kept secret as to which models those are...All in all, it's not a bad little stroller for under $80.",4
1761,"This is a nice umbrella stroller. Nice for traveling and quick trips. Folds up easy and let's a toddler sit more upright.",5
1762,"The First Years Ignite Stroller is a perfect light weight TRAVEL stroller! We purchased this for our baby's first international trip, and have used it for every outing since then. The umbrella covers just enough of the sunrays and it's easy to maneuver. The cup holder and fanny pack are so convenient. I can store my car keys and wallet safely. The undercarriage is not big enough to hold a diaper bag, but it is convenient for quick trips. We usually store small items like, pampers, baby's essentials, an umbrella, etc. under there. I wouldn't recommend this stroller for rocky terrain (FYI). But, if you need a lightweight stroller with style and sleek lines, for travel and everyday maneuvering, this is it!",5
1763,"When I was ready to downsize to a more 'travel friendly' stroller for my toddler I just went with one of the $20 specials at the store.  It folded up easy, was lightweight and the cost couldn't be beat.  But now I know that I shouldn't have gone so cheap.  This stroller was only $50 and it is worlds better!  It still folds up very easy, takes up only a little more space in my trunk and not only is the seat more comfortable for my little one, but I actually have area to store things AND a cupholder for my coffee.  Lesson learned for sure.",5
1764,"I got this before my baby was born and used it until he was several months old (maybe 9 months) and hanging over. He loved this just as much as we did. It is the perfect little spot to place your baby while in the living room. He would sleep, drink and just hang out in this lounger. Great product!",5
1765,"This product helped me so much in getting my breastfeeding established.  The first time I used it was when meeting with my lactation consultant.  It helped me build the confidence I needed to continue trying to breastfeed.  This product is pretty firm, much like a baby mattress is, and the cover is very soft.  I like that it has a sort of snap closure so if your baby is was like mine and would doze off while nursing, I could take it off pretty quietly and lay him in bed without using the velcro.  My only concern would be if your baby is prone to spit up, you might want to make sure to keep a cloth handy or something because the fabric isn't waterproof and it would soak into the &#34;pillow&#34; underneath.  The professional model has a waterproof cover.  It does have a decent size little pocket where you can keep a little cloth or something. In hindsight, i feel like this was a splurge.  After about a month I had the positioning down and really didn't need the pillow anymore, especially since the little man was growing.",4
1766,"I love this nursing pillow. I had a boppy pillow (which I like to use for my little man especially when's he's bigger and can sit up) but it didn't work at all for me. I had to add like 10 extra pillows just to make it kind of work. This nursing pillow is perfect. I can use it without any additional pillows (sometimes just a blanket to help create a bit of an incline). I take it with me everywhere - parents house, friends house, out shopping. It is great. So far has held up through severa washigs. My only concern is if to much milk gets on the pillow itself if it will get ruined but so far no problems.",5
1767,"Overall I really like these stainless steel bottles. I wanted something that was completely free of plastics, and this one fit the bill.The main drawback is that you cannot microwave these, so you have to heat water for formula first and then make the bottle. (I know they say you shouldn't microwave formula anyway, but please. Sometimes when baby is screaming for a bottle you have to do what is fastest). Or, with these, you can use warm water from the tap, but that is not recommended either.At any rate, I've ended up using these bottles more to offer my daughter a bit of water or watered down juice with her meals. I like that they stay cool, and they convert to sippy cups with a spout you can buy.The paint on the outside makes these look cute, but it does chip. Sometimes my daughter tries to gnaw on the bottle now that she is teething, so I really have to watch her with these.Overall, these are good bottles but I prefer Lifefactory glass bottles with the silicon sleeve, for the reasons indicated above.",4
1768,"Great sippy cup. Goes from a bottle to a sippy cup.  It is easy to clean and doesn't leak.  I get comments on these only time.The paint does come off of the stainless steel, so I do prefer the stainless steel ones.",5
1769,"I've bought a few sets of these Cushy Straps for our grand baby. I added them to his baby stroller, car seat and his infant swing straps. The Straps are very soft and give some support to their little necks.",5
1770,"A friend of mine recommended this movement monitor for me, and we love it! It alerts you if baby were to stop breathing and moving. Unfortunately, it has gone off several times when the baby was just fine, but I would much rather have that happen and be on the safe side! It gives me a peace of mind at night when we are sleeping. Very easy to use and the alert is very loud. Unless my 11 month old is very wiggly it stays in place just fine. I've only had to change the battery once, but we use it every night.",5
1771,"We love this seat!. I drive a Nissan Versa and have had my now 30lb 16 month old sitting backwards behind the drivers seat (with head extension on) for ~ 8 months. I'm comfortable and he's comfortable and safe! It is much easier to adjust when backwards if its not in the center of the back seat. A curved back seat makes it easier to adjust than a flat bench seat but its still doable. My husband drives a Saturn Vue (very flat backseat back) and he has no problem adjusting it, I think its much harder to adjust than in my car.",5
1772,"This is a roomy carseat and it fits my extra tall infant nicely.  He is comfortable in it.  My only gripe is that the straps are a little bit of a pain to adjust.  Not as smooth as the chicco straps/buckles.",4
1773,"I was hoping it would get more attention from my son... unfortunately he is just not fascinated but it. Not worth the price, IMHO",1
1774,"I like it more than my son does. He was 9 months when I got it, is 10 months now, and has never showed much interest in it. He likes his other book toys, peekaboo by Lamaze is his favorite!",2
1775,"We have this in the girly edition. I hate it. The padded ring has issues and flops around making it a total LEAKER! And if sat on for too long the darn thing comes off on your childs bottom (it gets stuck to the child). Again making a huge mess. The lid falls off constantly. Its rather short in stature and not made for taller toddlers learning to use the potty. We found the Fisher Price $12 potty to be a HUGE hit and so much easier to use!!",2
1776,"This monitor worked great for just over the 2 years we've had it. Liked the &#34;walky-talky&#34; function, and the normal monitor function worked fine for listening to my daughter when sleeping. Right before the two year mark of using it, one of the receivers/parent unit quit working. It acted like it was trying to connect, but no sound came through. I still used the other unit for her naps so I could do yardwork and be able to hear if she was awake, but now the second unit has gone kaput! This time all the lights light up but no sound or anything. We've taken it apart, detached the battery, and still neither one work.The base unit has a blue night light feature, which is helpful when needing to see in the dark, and my daughter now likes it as a night light for under her bed. It was too bright to have out in the open though, would keep her awake when she was a baby.Bummed this did not last longer. Good monitor if not planning on long-term use!",3
1777,"Our little guy loves this teether.  He has been able to hold onto it since about five months and has been happily gnawing away at it ever since.  Super easy to wash, no strange plasticy odor, soft enough to chew but firm enough to be helpful.",5
1778,"It is Okay.  I have not been able to find a good teething toy that our baby really likes to chew on for very long.",4
1779,"honestly, everything is great about this stroller EXCEPT&#8230;the storage! i jog with a pouch of emergency baby food, a blanket, and my wallet. my jacket, if i get too warm, i toss in the undercarriage, which is fine. but the pouch on the back of the baby seat was not well thought-out. i fold up my stroller and carry it into my condo, and every time all my baby's things fall out. baby jogger should've thought about a more practical closure. behind the mesh pouch, there is a ridiculously tight slot of a pocket held together by a velcro square, but it's also inconvenient having to jam my hand into it to scrounge around for whatever i need. and it's too tight of a fit for the baby blanket, not to mention if you tossed a small item in there you'd probably forget about it and never know it was in there because it's as tight as a mouse trap. other than that, great stroller.",4
1780,"I bought this for my daughter, but we could hardly use it, the straps sat so low they cut into her thighs and we couldn't adjust it to make it comfortable.",2
1781,"Great lightweight portable baby booster for home and eating out.  Easy to clean and take on and off the chair.",5
1782,"I was travelling to South Asia and wanted to get a booster seat that I can tie to a regular chair. Very compact and I packed this in my suitecase. Was easy to assemble and clean as well. I used the garden hose to clean it and hanged it outside to dry. Now this stays in my car. When we go to friends' houses, we use this at their dinner table. I highly recommend this product.",4
1783,"i got two of these (when the start was the bonus toy) my daughter loves to chew on the toy while we bath her, it also helps keep  her from wiggling around when we change her.",5
1784,"I use these for cloth wipes. They are thin and that works. Because they were rolled for packaging, they're still a bit curled at the ends.",5
1785,"The wash cloths are baby wash cloths nothing fancy or special but that fish is the most exciting bath toy ever.  Especially when he is teething.",5
1786,"My son (1 year old) likes to throw things from the high chair all the time.  This strap fits nicely around his metal insulated straw cup we use for water at meal times.  The cup doesn't have any sort of &#34;waist&#34; or skinny part to it to fit the strap around, but still the rubbery/grippy stuff on this strap holds it tight.  Great buy and I've already ordered another one!",5
1787,"I know others have written about buying smaller, but here is a note for the well-endowed.I was a 34 H before pregnancy and jumped to a 42I. I'm probably now around a 38I. But even at this size, the goddess was still way too big. I'm happy with the large. Also note that it stretches out each time you use it. So unless you plan on washing it between each shower, you might want to get more than one.I'd also like to add that my use for it changed. At first when I was super sensitive, it was was great for in the shower.Once that passed, I'd put it on after the shower to prevent leaking while I was getting ready.Now... it's kinda great for sex to avoid leaking mid-fun :)",5
1788,"I got this because everyone said it would be painful to shower after delivery but honestly this was a waste of money and not needed for me.  With that being said, it was a nice soft material and I would assume it would be helpful if needed.",3
1789,"Picture shows a bottle but description says without bottle.  It does NOT include a bottle.  For the price, it's not a full kit, and that's disappointing.  I am a pediatrician and lactation consultant, so I keep these on hand for desperate families.  The rest of the set up is fine, just not ready to use out of the package.",3
1790,"These are the best brand for switching from bottles. Small mouth piece makes it easy for little ones. Leak proof. Dishwasher safe. Very durable. Highly recommend.",5
1791,"I bought these extra wide shades for my 2014 VW JettaWagon and they fit beautifully! (they do not fit over the little triangle part of the window!) The only issue I had was to get them to initially stick- I bought them in the winter when the temps where in the teens and the suction cups just wouldn't stick.  Fortunately, once the temps warmed up to around 35-40 the shades stuck fine.  I've had them up for about 5 months now and they haven't fallen down once.  However, I am afraid that if I take them down on my own then I might not get them to stick again just based on all the reviews.  The bottom suction cup does occasionally pop off but it is not that big of a problem for me.  My daughter will play with the shade when this happens but the shade still stays on the window- I guess my 2 year old isn't strong enough to pull it off yet.",4
1792,"These scissors are seriously a lifesaver - there's no guess work with what you're trimming or where. My son doesn't even flinch when I cut his nails. I cut them when he's drowsy or asleep and I get them trimmed short and neat. LOVE these!!! I buy them for all of my new mom friends now.",5
1793,"I love that the scissor part is so small...i have no fear as I cut my daughter's nails as she sleeps....I tired the nail files but they never worked .....",5
1794,"I had purchased a different baby nail scissor before and it was too big and bulky. I was afraid to cut the baby by accident, and after a while the blades were dull from use.  This nail cutter is small and easy to use. Would recommend to new parents for nail cutters.",5
1795,"My baby was 10 lbs when born and this snuggle sack was just too tight across the shoulders.  She hated it.  We wore it once in the hospital and didn't fit again.  I'm not buying the size up.",3
1796,"We love the Woombie!!!! We were using the miracle blanket but when my daughter was 10 weeks she was getting out of it. I was afraid she was going to cover her face with the blanket when she undid the swaddle so I had to find something else. I bought the Woombie and absolutely love it! It gives her the opportunity to move around inside but my little Houdini could not get out of it. The first night I put her in it she loved it. The only problem I found was they run small. You should buy a size bigger than what you need because they will shrink after being washed. Other than that love it!",5
1797,"I was really excited to try this since our newborn loves to be swaddled and sometimes trying to swaddle her in the middle of the night results in a less than tight swaddle that she'll wiggle out of.  This was really cute and I liked the materials - it was soft and surprisingly stretchy.  Unfortunately, she could get her arms out of the top and the snap section flipped up over her face so I had to return it.  I wish we had kept it to try out now that she's bigger because I really did like it and I was excited for the convenience of this.  We bought it when she was about a month old and she was about 6 lbs at the time, and she's a skinny kid, so maybe it was just her.",3
1798,"This was one of the many things I tried to get my newborn sleep through the night. This one in particular is pretty tight but it does allow some stretch room if the baby wants to move his/her arms. My baby did not like it much...he'd get frustrated and cried. Nice fabric and all...",3
1799,"These blankets are such great snuggle blankets!  We take them everywhere.  Even now that it is warmer, since we are in the summer months, we take them along.  They are light enough weight that your baby won't be too hot underneath.  And they are huge, so they are great for swaddling as well!  The bamboo material is super soft!",5
1800,"Softest blankets ever! However these aren't good to swaddle with because they are so soft they don't hold well. But they're amazing to use as just a blanket.",5
1801,"It is a splurge that I am glad I made.  I began using this when my little one was 6 months old as a transition out of the polar fleece bags I used all winter.  I have been using it nightly for 2.5 months with a minimum of once a week washings and have had no issues with the zipper.  Be aware that it does require extra drying time, but I find that if I turn it inside out halfway through the dry cycle that it dries more quickly.  I also always wash and dry it with the zipper closed, so I am not sure if that helps with the zipper issue that others are having or not.",5
1802,"This is hands-down the best item we bought for our little guy.  He used it all winter and part of the Spring.  It is so safe, and will fit him for a while.  The fabric is warm, but breathable, and easy to take on and off.  You won't have to worry about any danger from blankets, and you'll know he/she is warm enough.  I would recommend getting a lighter one for the warmer months if you keep your house cool with the A/C.  The grey is also nice for a boy or girl if you are trying to purchase for either gender.  My husband and I both love this thing!!!",5
1803,"We love this chair. My baby just sits and has fun in the center of attention. We can put it anywhere. It's light and portable. She loves to sit on the counter or the table. But parents, please don't leave your baby unattended. Even though there is a seatbelt, the little ones are wiggly. Even if it's on the floor, it can topple over so be careful! We haven't had any problems, but others should pay attention. The only complaint is that they couldn't ship it to my APO overseas.",5
1804,"The product itself is good, so I hate to give it a less than stellar star rating but I want to advise this mattress doesn't fit the graco pack n play on the go portable crib like I had seen noted in some reviews. Maybe if you're fine with sticking a towel in between the gap you could get away with it, but it's about 2 inches too short width and length. I went with a little larger dream on me product. As I stated earlier, still a good product just didn't work for my graco portable crib like advertised.",2
1805,"I understand its a safety thing but it is a little to firm (picture the top of a padded metal chair seat), my son would not sleep on it. I put a half inch of foam on top and that did the trick.",4
1806,"The plastic clips don't clip on at the ... front or the back. One of those.but it's still better than nothing.maybe just a piece of plastic with a rubber band would have been better, though.",3
1807,"Eh. The BJ Rain Canopy is difficult to attach so it just kind of gets forgotten as yet another accessory.",3
1808,"We have 3 of these, that's how much I like them.Pros: -Clear container is good so that I can see liquid levels-My daughter can open and close this easilyCons: -You do have to be careful not to tighten the lid too tightly as the stopper/seal will move away if it's over tightened, causingit to leak-As with all sippy cups, make sure to take everything apart to clean and dry to avoid any molding issues...fortunately theparts are easy to clean",5
1809,"Can't go wrong with a thermos leakproof water container. This is what they specialize in. The color purchased was cheaper than some of the other colors too. Worked out since our LO is a toddler girl.",5
1810,"This is one of the best zippy cups around, (that aren't plastic).  I only wish it came with a cap, as it does leak a little in my bag or son's lunch bag when turned sideways or upside down.  Not enough that I wouldn't re-purchase, but something I hope they change in future cups.  The spout is not plastic, it's silicone and the body is stainless steel.  My son drinks from it easily.",5
1811,"I have bought two of these now.  They are very sturdy but the inside parts need to be sterilized in the dishwasher regularly and the straw gets nasty so you may need replacements and the straw cleaner.",4
1812,"Probably my favorite bags. I really don't have a quality preference just because I've literally never had one break before. Of any brand. These are a great price though and the company is so accommodating. I usually get some type of freebie in my box. Plus these are &#34;prettier&#34; than other bags. LOL.",5
1813,"I have ordered these bags before and not had a problem, but in the most recent box that I got, nearly ALL of the bags leaked when I was defrosting my milk in the refrigerator. I lost several ounces of milk. Pretty big bummer for as expensive as these bags are, and how hard we work to provide and store milk for our babies!",2
1814,"These have done the job perfectly and I haven't had one leak like I have had with different brands.  I also love not worrying about buying more, I have all that I need.",5
1815,"Liked it just 2 out of 25 leaked...way better than others in the market. Ni ce pro duct it is",5

1817,"It's just as good as it has to be. Can't complain about anything. We cut of the legs and made beautiful montessori floor bed with just enough freedom and security",5
1818,"We purchased this bed for our son to transition from his crib. It is well made, and was easy to assemble. Although they state the weight limit is 50 lbs, I am able to squeeze into it with him on occassion without issue (140 lbs.). The side bars are great, but still allow him space to crawl in and out on his own. The crib mattress that we already had fit fine, as did the sheets. We opted for this style of bed versus the &#34;character&#34; options to help him focus on sleeping, rather than looking at Elmo or Mickey on his headboard. For us, that was an important factor for a successful transition.",5
1819,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas 2013; it matches her room perfectly, she loves it AND it stands up to toddler punishment. We don't allow her to jump on it, BUT being a toddler, it has happened haha. Bed is in great shape so far. Simple to put together, although allow at least an hour. I also LOVE that is has guard rails on BOTH sides so I am not limited in my placement of it in her room.If your looking for something sturdy but also simple and modern and adorable this is the right bed. We don't care for too many frills or tacky character beds. This bed fits into any decor.We are currently considering buying the same brand (different color) for our son who is about to graduate to a toddler bed.",5
1820,"These are handy if pins make you nervous.  They do tend to snag the fabric of my flats if my toddler is being grab-happy during a diaper change, which is precisely why I can't use pins.  We use the size 1 on our 26 pound 23-month-old.  They work just fine and I don't feel the need to buy size 2.",4
1821,"my daughter has found these very helpful for teething. i only suggest that you limit her accessibility to them when they are not walking. i think it could cause great harm if she fell face first while this was in her mouth. that's why i give her the frozen wash clothes when she's walking around and this when she is in my arms, car seat, etc.",5
1822,"My 16m daughter loves these and has been using them for a few months, ever since she started getting molars.  She can hold it herself very easily and the hole on the bottom means I can attach it to a tether (the kind meant for pacifiers).",5
1823,"Great for the back molars. My 18 month old chomps down on these often. Save the tears with these teethers.",4
1824,"Love this for my baby.  It is easy for him to hand onto, and the wide part prevents him from pushing it to far down his throat and gagging.  rubber part at the end has bumps that he likes.  Would make a great gift.",5
1825,"I'm not sure why but my twins would rather chew on a spoon over this.  It is smaller than the picture and not much for them to chew on.",1
1826,"This has been perfect for my 2 year old who is getting her back molars. So many tethers are round and can't get back there",5
1827,"We used these to teach my daughter to use straw cups. They have been a great success. She's never used a sippy cup, but started with these and then transitioned easily to a straw cup and regular cup.",5
1828,"We've used the smaller Zo-li and now got the bigger size too. It's very clever design and the straw end stays in liquid no matter how you tilt and turn it. My problem is that the outer straw is made of cheap and thin materials and it cannot withstand toddlers biting, chewing, twisting or turning. We've had this only for less than a month and I've to look for replacement straws already. This was the same exact problem with the smaller bottle too. The bottle also is thin and flimsy made with cheap plastic which probably costs nothing.For the price they charge ($10-15), they've got to make it with better materials!5 stars for the design, 1 star for materials and manufacturing.",3
1829,"Zoli has great customer service! And these cups are great! I have 2 each for my 1 year old twins and they have used them since they were 8 months old.  They don't leak very much. When really cold beverage goes in them, they seem to leak more but a lukewarm beverage doesn't leak hardly at all.  I think any sippy cup is going to leak to some extent and this one is one of the best by far!  It also has very few parts and is easy to put together which is nice. The straw isn't too hard to clean but does need to be changed regularly... Mine had mold growing in it (I didn't change for a few months... My bad) using the brush for the straw helps and I think is a must.  That is the only bad part, the straw is so thin it will never dry completely inside.",5
1830,"I really like this glider.  It was super easy to put together.  (I was able to easily assemble it on my own while 7 months pregnant.)  Overall, it's super comfy.  Actually, for me at now 9 months pregnant, it's the most comfortable place in the house.  My only complaint is it's loud squeaking.  However, two liberal sprays of WD-40 on all of the joints seems to have fixed the issue for now.  Also, the back is on the shorter side.  However, it's the perfect fit for my husband and I.(Posting under my husband's account.)",4
1831,"I got the brown puppy Wubbanub at a store while we were doing our 4D ultrasound months ago and after how much baby loved it, I ordered three more!  Thank goodness I did because our real puppy decided that he wanted the original one as his chew toy. :/  Our baby although only a newborn likes to hold on to these and I love how they lay on her chest perfectly so you don't have to keep fixing it when it falls out.  She loves staring at them even when she's not sucking on them and likes to hold one of the arms as she falls asleep for a nap.  I am so thrilled with these that I suggest them to all my mommy friends.",5
1832,"These are a godsend. We tuck them into the baby's swaddle & car seat straps and they stay put. Nurse at the hospital introduced us to these. So cute too!",5
1833,"So cute, so soft but this one does not stay in like the ducky! My baby started on soothes but soon had to transfer because they wouldn't stay in.",3
1834,"It really depends if your baby will take to this specific paci. My daughter did not care for it too much, she like the Nuk Brand ones. I wish Wubbanub would make these with a removable paci for easier cleaning or choosing your own paci. This is the only reason why i give it 4 stars.",4
1835,"I LOVE the idea of this stroller. My son actually refused to take naps unless it was in the toddler seat and he goes crazy over the side kick (as well as everyone who sees it). I only wish the handle didn't break while I was trying to leave Disneyland. I don't have an SUV or van so you could imagine my panic when I couldn't remove the toddler seat from the base. I went with my toddler and newborn and my husband wasn't with me. I almost had to leave this $2000 + travel system in the parking lot. Luckily I was able to fold it closed with the seat still attached and fit it in my back seat, yes with my two kids. My husband was able to drill out the rivets and replace the broken cord with bicycle cord, but a short time later the other side broke. I only wish they would do a recall on this seat and stop ignoring the faulty design. I also got this stroller as a gift but purchased all of the attachments..... literally all of them...down to the little sun shade for the toddler car seat. I recently bought the g3 seat to replace the g2 and I will let you all know if they have changed it :)",3
1836,"Exactly what we wanted/needed for our toddler.  For use on airplanes as well as your automobile.  Super comfortable, easy to install and it even comes with a detachable cup holder.  Classy.  Lol!",5
1837,"Great gift for a friend who just had a baby.",5
1838,"My only complaint with this is that its not 2ftx1ft.  Its small and fits on the counter great and helps dry all of the different parts of a pump and bottle set.",5
1839,"We use Dr. Browns bottles with all the little pieces. This innovative drying rack makes getting everything dry a breeze! It's small footprint doesn't take up much space on your counter. It holds a lot.  If you want something larger, check out Boon Yard! I didn't know that was available when I bought this. And it just looks mod and adorable. High Quality. Buy it!",5
1840,"use this for all my bottle parts as well as baby spoons, and it is so cute! i don't mind seeing it on my counter next to the kitchen sink :)",5
1841,"It looks nicer than the regular plastic drying racks and more sanitary.  Won't be used forever, but it will do the job for the time being.",4
1842,"I had high hopes for this dryer! However, it didn't take long before those hopes were dashed. When you're feeding your child every 2-4 hours you run through a lot of bottles, you are constantly washing and drying.  This drying rack is far to small to hold the amount of bottles one goes through on a regular basis, and with that, bottles don't really fit very well on it. Then when you add all of the other things you must wash and dry, breast pump accessories and bottle accessories (nipples, rings, bases, etc.) it falls far short of any expectations. We ended up donating ours to charity and buying the Playtex SmartSpace Drying Rack which is a far better option and holds so much more. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this drying rack.",1
1843,"I had always thought I didn't need something like this until I finally gave it a try and I LOVE it!  The sippy cups dry so much faster on this and all the little parts like straws, medicine syringes, and intricate cup tops are easily stored and dry here too.  I really love how much this thing fits and how it doesn't take up much space on my counter.  Initially I thought it wouldn't hold much but it typically holds about five sippy cups, including the tops, the straws, and the occasional formula divider too.",5
1844,"I bought the smaller one because of our counter space. I use Dr Brown Bottles, those of you who do know all the parts can be a pain. I can fit 15 bottles (9- 8.5oz & 6- 4oz), all 15 blue vent reservoirs and all 15 of the brown vent inserts. I paired this with a drying mat from TRS that I keep folded under it when not in use and I can dry all the nipples and collars with it. If you have space I'd get the larger size",5
1845,"We love our 'grass' and use it daily, even though my son is well past the bottle stage. You can fit SO MUCH on this tray because of the design, we didn't even need to buy any of the twig attachments. Cleans easily, the grass lifts out of the white base. The only issue I had was with the base itself - it sits flush on your countertop, and while most of the water is going to fall through the grass into the base, some will inevitable end up going under the base itself without you realizing until you lift the whole thing up. I just put some plastic bumpers (like the stick-on ones for cabinet doors) underneath to act as legs, allowing air to get under the base to allow the runoff to dry.",5
1846,"don't expect it to hold bottles perfectly. good for you only if you are using 3-4 bottles with nipples, after that its loaded and cannot hold more. i purchased the other brand listed here for holding more bottles",3
1847,"Going through the letters, she's not so much into that now, but we put 6 together to make her name and a cube and she loves stacking these.  Eventually she'll listen to the sounds...",5
1848,"Works pretty good. I just cant seem to get it adjusted small enough around my belly. I end up with a huge gap. I just use a throw pillow to fill the gap. This is the only way to tandem nurse, but for nursing one at a time, I've found a regular pillow works better.",4
1849,"These tubes cause WAY more condensation to form inside them than the official Medela ones. I have to keep my pump running for minutes on end after I'm done just to get rid of that condensation and make sure no mold grows in them. I don't quite understand how the different material can cause more condensation, but it does. Next time I'll get official Medela tubes.",2
1850,"I bought this set to replace the tubing that came with the pump because the old tubes had developed mold.  Sure enough, mold collected inside the tubes within the first week of usage.",2
1851,"The tubing matched up with with my Medela pump. There were not any compatibility issues (since it is not Medela brand).",4
1852,"I had to purchase new hoses and these are exactly the same hoses that came with my Medela Pump in Style Advance.",5
1853,"I have gotten the medela replacement tubing and this off brand. The connecters are shaped a little differently but both worked equally well. Save your money and get these.I would also suggest everyone get a back up set of tubing. My original tubing became moldy over night. I had to dump my milk for two days until my medela replacement came for fear of mold spores in the milk. Who wants to feel their baby mold. Get a back up set of tubes now before the mold forms.",5
1854,"Great replacement, fits perfectly with my Pump In Style Medela Pump. Have ordered one more set as the first set I ordered I didn't force the condensation out and they got a little moldy - my fault :(",5
1855,"We can't get enough of Haba toys and this one is no exception.  My infant daughter loved twisting and pulling it.",5
1856,"Unless you get this for really cheap, I would stick to the JJ cole bundleme. This one is very thin!! Not great for the harsh winters that's we've been getting",2
1857,"This is good to have if you have a diaper bag to go with it. It lets bag hang instead of having to drag on ground here and there.",5
1858,"I use this for pumping at work and it's great. I previously was using the Playtex Fridge To Go, but found that I either needed to use two 8oz bottles or awkwardly try and stack 4 4-5oz bottles. So I got this instead, and it easily holds 5 4-5 oz bottles (even though it comes with 6). It keeps my milk cold until I get home (about 10 hours total). I also use my Medela bottles with this since I sometimes leave the milk in the bottle in the fridge. The lids could use some improving. I don't think that they screw on as tightly as they should. But I haven't had a problem with leakage, although that could be because I never tip the bag. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is pumping away from home for more than a few hours.",5
1859,"Actually have a medela pump and wanted another cooler to store bottles. The ameda bottles are a decent fit to the medela. Not the best fit but I can fudge. The cooler is great. Can fit 5 medela bottles or the 6 ameda bottles it comes with",5
1860,"Nice milk storage bag. Loved the removable freezer packs that fit in nicely and don't move around while transported. Bottles fit right in. Used it for pumping at work and bringing milk home and had no problems with it.",5
1861,"I had bought this for a portable crib that came with this very thin mattress.  The reviews were good, and I can't complain.  My granddaughter is now 20 months old, so just about ready to give up the porta-crib, but this mattress has lasted well and I have no complaints.",5
1862,"This has saved my baby from bumping his head on numerous occasions.  Goes well with our frog themed bathroom",5
1863,"These work great! We installed them for the 'knife' drawer and the lazy susan cabinet. Follow the directions and you'll be good to go!",5
1864,"I bought these to put on doors in our apartment to keep my toddler daughter out of certain rooms. These work great. With practice we can even open the strap with one hand. We havnt yet tried to remove these from the doors, I hope they come off easy when the time comes to move.",5
1865,"These do their job, which is to keep my son from using his dresser drawers as steps.  BUT!!- They will peel off/remove/damage the finish on your furniture.  But being that I want to refinish my son's dresser anyways, I don't think it's that big of a deal.  I just think that other parents should know.  They are pretty easy to use,  hard for a child to use.  Very good at keeping drawers shut.",3
1866,"These are great! We've reordered three times. Perfect for baby gift thank yous as well as for my two year old son. Love them!",5
1867,"This is great to quickly mark milestones for baby. I don't always have time to write in baby book so I use this as a reminder for things I want to record at a later date. Super cute.",5
1868,"I LOVE this mat! It's big, soft, colorful and my son loves it. Unlike the infant mats with gyms attached, this is just a big mat with some padding. It's not super pillowy... if he tips over, he feels the ground (we put it on a rug), but I LIKE that because it is portable. HIGHLY recommend if you're looking for a large mat.",5
1869,"This is a great mat. Its really comfy, soft, sturdy. Easy to just throw in the wash. My son used it when he was having tummy time and not so mobile. Its also light and easy to travel with. So when I would have a family member watch him, I would bring it knowing he was on the floor on something clean.This is the one item I decided to hold on to and not give away in case we decide on another baby.",5
1870,"Newborn babies can see, red-white and black better  in their firs few months. Therefore it is recommended that those colors should be used as much as possible for better visual stimulation. However after that time, the growing child can enjoy other colors as well that is why I waited until my son grew 6 months before purchasing this item.Beforehands, we were using a same size mat which ad black and white figures on. He was deeply interested in that when he was younger but we wanted something more colorful as he grew up and became more active.This mat has everything one can imagine: A good built quality, lots of well painted figures, many many attractions ( a detachable mirror for him to get used to his self image, some squeaky attachment for both tactile and hearing stimulation, different textured areas again for tactile stimulation etc).My son spends 30 minutes without break on it moving from one corner to the other all the time. He is interested in every detail and I can say this has contributed his mobility and fine motor skills. We put the previous one side by side with this one but he does not fancy the previous mat anymore. He spends the entire time on this shiny mat. So I wholeheartedly recommend this product even if you have a mat like in my case...5 stars...",5
1871,"Washes great. Lighweight. Only wish I had one as big as living room floor since now shes crawling everywhere and doesnt stay on mat now.",5
1872,"We can't get enough of Haba toys and this one is no exception.  My infant daughter loved shaking and clacking it.",5
1873,"Holds about 8 to 10 dirty cloth diapers. Haven't noticed any smell when the bag is zipped shut. Seems to contain all the moisture inside and haven't experienced any leaks. Great wet bag!",5
1874,"We use this bag mostly while traveling. It holds more diapers than we need - we use flats while traveling -  and doesn't release any smells at all. We've had a maximum of 7 flats in the bag and there was space for several more. We are very happy with our purchase!",5
1875,"I've only used the bag once so far and have not washed it yet so I'm not sure how it holds up in the washer or dryer. So far we have used it to change a poopy diaper. The waterproof inside lining kept it from leaking through, but it is definitely not stink proof. While it holds in the smell better than a plastic bag, it was still too stinky to put it back into my diaper bag to be carried around the rest of the shopping trip. I'm not sure if I would buy another one or recommend this one just yet.. I guess I'll have to use it more.",3
1876,"I purchased this small bag to transport my Milkies Milk Saver (a MUST own if you are breastfeeding), as well as a coldpack and container for the saved milk.  This way, I can save my milk even when I'm nursing out.  This bag is adorable and high quality.  It would also fit 2 cloth diapers if I were to use it for that.  I opted for the Medium size for my diapers.",5
1877,"I now have 3 of these bags, so I can bring a fresh one to day care each day, and also have one to use at home. The large size (with handle) works great hanging off one of the changing table knobs. These really do a great job of keeping odors in.  My only complaint is that the waterproof liner is (understandably) sensitive to heat, so the manufacture recommends low dryer settings, or air drying away from hot sun.  Both of these methods take quite a long time to dry.  I either dry my cloth diaper pads on high heat or sun them in the bright sun, and it would be nice to be able to dry everything together for time and simplicity's sake.  But, still a great product!",4
1878,"Love this bag. First when I viewed this bag online I didn't think anything of it but a typical bag. So after I had purchased and it arrived, I was very surprised at how huge this bag really is. It's great for my daughters dirty clothes for on the go. I will definitely purchase another one in a different size.",5
1879,"The bag seems pretty good, for the most part. I have a similarly sized bag from Itzy Ritzy, and the quality of the Planet Wise bag is definitely lesser, though the bag is slightly roomier. The fabric is lightweight and thin, and it makes me anxious about tearing. The bag does well at containing wetness and smell. I'm able to comfortably fit about three pocket diapers in the medium bag, which is plenty for a full morning of shopping with a toddler. I like the fun print, and am glad to have it, overall. It is disappointing to me that the wash instructions don't allow for it to be washed in hot with the diapers, but I can just throw it in a cold load with another day's laundry. It's sufficient, but probably not my first choice in the future.",4
1880,"I love this wet bag! I originally ordered pail liners for the bedroom, but I use this more than anything. I just hang it off of the door handle by my changing table, and it works great!",5
1881,"LO grew so fast that we used it only once or twice. Not really worth getting if you plan to stay home a lot but I can see it being safe for infants that travel more",5
1882,"These do the job, but the lavendar scent is sickening, especially when masking gross things like garbage, cat litter, or diapers. Sort of defeats the purpose . . . .",3
1883,"I bought these to put around the diaper can in my baby's room and they didn't work at all.  I then decided to put all of them in my car which doesn't smell, but I didn't want to waste them and even having all 5 in my car, I would open the door and not even smell a hint of them being there.  Unless you are sniffing these things with your nose plastered up against, them, they are completely useless.  Don't waste your money.",1
1884,"Great concept to have it small and more portable. However it is not as odor neutralizing as the good old fashion arm & hammer in an orange box.",3
1885,"After looking at some of the other reviews I'm wondering if there was something I did wrong, because I could not tell that these fresheners worked at all! I put them in the trashcan in my baby's room, and I never could tell a difference.",2
1886,"Baby has not really played with it yet but he has started to mouth the hands, which are kind of rubbery. The rattle sound is very soft and the material feels really nice. Seems to be very sturdy.",4
1887,"we received the crib before the date arrival that was quoted. the crib is wonderful, sturdy feeling and fairly easy to assemble...only problem:our box was a little damaged, but the crib was fine and all pieces were in it.",5
1888,"This is great for the grandparents' house, but my daughter got her arm and leg stuck three times before I finally decided to go out and get a breathable bumper to block the slats. But then you have a problem that the breathable bumpers are made for full cribs, so you end up wrapping it twice. Just a total pain an extra money to be spend. Don't forget that you'll need a mini-crib sheet as regular crib sheets will be way too big. I did end up ordering a thicker mattress (another $25) as the one that comes with it is like paper.The good side, it's easy to fold up, has wheels so it can move around, and she sleeps just fine in it.The bad side, mattress it comes with is way too thin to be comfortable and the slats allow for the baby's appendages to get stuck.",3
1889,"This crib is just as described.  Easy to assemble and sturdy.  Our grandson is only two months old and slept his first month in a bassinet until we moved him into this crib.  Loves it.  Mobile hooks on any side.  Love that it has three levels.  We would recommend it to anyone who needs the space.  I just wish it was a bit longer so we could use it longer.  Hope to keep him in it for many months to come.  We would buy this item again. It arrived in good condition and on time.",5
1890,"Literally couldn't be happier with these, I have two for my twins. I thought they were broken when I first got them because I filled the reservoir to the top (not excessively)... apparently you shouldn't do that. They work pretty fast too. As per mold, no sign yet, I only use bottles with tightly fitted travel caps in it, not the nipple etc attached which seems to prevent formula from mixing with the steamer water. Also... you can use it to sterilize small stuff like pacifiers and bottle nipples etc. It is exactly what I was looking for...",5
1891,"This product did not work when I took it out of the box. Not sure if I just got a faulty one or what.",1
1892,"I recall kind of laughing at the idea of having a bottle warmer, thinking it was one of those dumb things people buy when they're expecting a baby and it's not that useful. I WAS TREMENDOUSLY WRONG. Before we got this bottle warmer, we were warming every bottle by hand under hot water, or letting it sit in a pot of warm water for anywhere from 5-8 minutes. When you have a tiny baby on your hands who is screaming for food, you not only don't have the extra hand to hold the bottle under hot water but you don't have the time to spare.We got this bottle warmer, and it changed everything for us. Prep the bottle, drop it in, press go, and then tend to your baby while the bottle is warming. This thing is so super easy to use, I'm mad at myself that it took us as many weeks as it did to get one! We loved it so much, we actually got a second one as we live in a 3-story house: one upstairs for overnight bottles and one in the kitchen for every other portion of the day. For the price and service this provides, this thing is great. Also wonderful for sanitizing new items like bottles and pacifiers.I recall reading about the stinky water situation, and people were right about that. You just have to be mindful to make sure that no milk or formula gets on the outside of the bottle before you put it in the warmer. You should also change the water in the side container if it ever gets murky. Keep those things in mind, and you'll avoid any issue with this thing.",5
1893,"Got these when my Dr. Browns microwave steamer didn't fit in my microwave. Great price and value, each bag gets 20 uses, (bags also have little check boxes to keep track of the uses) comes with 5 bags and steaming is only really needed one a week as maintenance.",5
1894,"Work just the same as Medela bags but are cheaper. I will purchase these again! Great product at a great price.",5
1895,"We have the regular steam/sterilizer as well.  This is just quicker with less parts to clean and put away after. Would recommend and buy again.",5
1896,"I have used the &#34;other&#34; brand of sanitizing bags for a long time and found these bags as a cheaper alternative.  Having now used both I don't really see any difference other than the plastic on these feels a little thinner, which in no way affects the functionality.If you have pacifiers and bottle parts to sanitize, these are great.",5
1897,"This is a little high speed for this type of door lock. I was excited about it because of the versatility. Mainly that it did everything the Door Monkey did but allowed you to shut the door which was important for what we needed it for. It just does not hold the door shut. My 2 yr old is able to get it to slip with only a little effort. I did read that it was not effective on certain door jams so I was not going to ding it too hard just because it did not work for my particular situation except...the Door Monkey we got with this works perfectly on all the doors that this one does not. That, to me, implies a design flaw. It is obviously possible for it to work...but it does not, so 2 stars. I did want to give it credit for its versatility, options, and the fact that it probably works fine in very specific circumsatnces.",2
1898,"bought this for my moms house who only has a shower but no tub. Daughter fit in there just fine but I did buy a mat to fit on the inside after reading reviews and she never slipped. Just be careful if the child is able to get up and stand. I always made my daughter stay seated. Its a good size tub. She hasn't taken a bath in the tub for a while but when she was about 2 yrs she still fit in there. We got it when she was about 1 and it was great option if you have no tub.",5
1899,"These bottles worked for me. I love the size they are compact for travel, easy to clean, don't leak, and the lids fit my medela bottles. They are marked to 3oz or 90 ml, but hold 4oz when filled to the neck for freezing.  They fit on my Medela pump in style advanced On-the-Go Tote, I have pumped directly into them and they work just fine. When attached to the pump the yellow valves of the breastshield protrude down into the bottle leaving less space to pump a full 4 oz into the bottle. I primarily used my medela bottles (I had 5 bottles) to pump. Any milk not used by the end of the day, was frozen in these bottles (I had 15 simplisse bottles).I do not feed my LO from these bottles so can't comment of feeding. These bottles are stamped Made in USA. I recommend these bottlesI have also used 5oz First Essentials bottles from target for pumping, very affordable (3 bottles for 2.50). They don't come with lids but these lids, Dr Brown's lids, and medela lids fit them. Also great for BM storage. These bottles are also stamped Made in the USA.I recommend these bottles.",5
1900,"I bought this for my 7 month old.  We had previously purchased the Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cups.  For me, those cups leaked everywhere, but were very easy for my son to drink from, and he seemed to like them a lot.These cups don't leak (yay), but are much harder for my son to drink from (boo).  I assume he'll eventually figure it out, but for training, the Dr. Brown cups aren't as good as the Playtex cups, I think.  The Dr. Brown cups are much easier to wash though.  They come apart pretty easily and ride though the dishwasher with no problems.  I had trouble getting the Playtex cups apart and back together to run through the dishwasher.",4
1901,"after trying so many formula caddy's this one is the best. A tirck when pouring is dont try to dump it and hit it, dump it turn and dump agian until all the formula is out",5
1902,"Enough room to store 4 scoops (an 8 ounce bottles worth) of formula in each portion of the container. The funnel top is nice, but you'll still need to knock it around a little to get it all out. The lid and snap are both snug, so I'm not worried about any formula spilling in the diaper bag. Very pleased with my purchase!",5
1903,"Received this item last week and we're already using it.  It works as it is supposed to and easy to wash in the dishwasher.  We're definitely saving money now that we are not purchasing the travel formula packs.",5
1904,"I got this to help protect my seats from all of the various things my baby will &#34;loose&#34; while riding in the car.  While I like the cover and I like that it has pockets you can put stuff in there are some downsides.  When the cover is in the folded position for when the seat faces backwards it can interfere with loading and unloading the seat.  Sometimes you have to push it back so that the seat will set in the base.  It does not seem like a safety concern, just an annoyance.",3
1905,"This is a great mat for under car seats. Especially if your kids have a habit of putting their feet on the seat even when you tell them not too Keep those dirty foot prints off the seats",5
1906,"We have leather seats and we didn't want the car seat doing any damage to the leather.  We ended up buy two (one for each vehicle) and have been very pleased with the product.",5
1907,"I bought one for each of my kids. They all fit in the backseat of my mdx perfect! My older daughter uses a backless booster. And sometimes the top folds down. But thats not an issue. I with there was a strap to attach the top piece from falling. But it still works wonders and keeps my seats shoe print free.",5
1908,"It is a nice mat for under my Britax B-Safe car seat. It has a little pouch in the front of it to put things in and it folds down for I fat seat use. Only wish it were a little wider. Read some leather reviews - I am not using this on leather seats so I can't comment on that. It also made my car seat more level so that was an unexpected plus.",4
1909,"I chose this diaper bag after looking at many diaper bags - I wanted something that didn't look like a diaper bag (so no ugly florals or quilting or specific baby designs) and that was large enough to hold all baby and my essentials. When it arrived I was pleased at the size and the accessories and all the pockets etc however the bag itself is rather heavy. Wasn't thrilled with the stroller straps but the bag fits nicely in the basket of our stroller. We used it well (nearly every day, a few airplane trips etc) for over a year (purchased in March 2013 and it's now June 2014 as I write this review) and I was aware of other reviews I'd read regarding the quality. The bag wore well and aside from some of the color wearing on the edges on the outside, I didn't have any problems with it until the other week (over a year from purchase) when the inner lining tore away from the side panel of the bag, I guess the adhesive had disintegrated and the backing on the lining was also starting to fall apart. This was very disappointing as I'd hoped this bag would last longer. Especially considering that it was a gift.When this happened I got in touch with the Timi and Leslie customer service and they were very helpful. They do have a one year warranty on their bags but as things go, this bag tore a little outside that timeframe. They were kind enough to send a replacement bag. I'm hoping that the adhesive issues have been improved and that it will last enough to make it worth the original price I paid for the bag.It's a fashionable, practical bag and I'm glad I could give a positive review due to excellent customer service despite the issues I had with it.",3
1910,"So far so good!It is huge! *I don't think it's fair to mark the item down for it's size when the dimensions are clearly listed* The size is as described. We cloth diaper & I love the space, pockets, style!Originally I wanted the Rachel bag & couldn't find it anywhere, now I'm glad!The stroller straps are great. I love the color & all the accessories!",5
1911,"super cute bag. not as big as I thought it was going to be, but fits pretty much everything you need...for now anyway!",5
1912,"I purchased this bag hoping to find a functional diaper bag that also had the look of a fashionable purse. As far as the looks go, I am very pleased. The bag looks very nice. As far as the functionality of the bag, I am less impressed. There is no real ability to organize baby stuff. The bag is also very deep, as mentioned in previous reviews, it becomes like a black pit.  I also cloth diaper and this bag just cannot hold everything I need.",3
1913,"I adore our quarter moon light. I love how portable it is and that it's not so bright that it keeps me awake too if I'm in the room. We've been using ours for almost 5 years and it's still going strong, it still holds a charge for almost 12 hours too. I can't recommend it enough.",5

1915,"These sheets are a great addition to our little mans room. We love them and have had no problems with them so far.",5
1916,"I thought this had the option to stick shade up by rolling it in window but it doesn't. I hate suction cups because they usually do not work. They didn't work on this the first time I put it up. Second time it has stayed up so far for a couple of weeks. No complaints. Only reason I gave it three stars is because either I can't read or it wasn't clear about if it had suction cups and I terribly dislike suction cups. :) It's on the window opposite of the youngin' so I can't tell you about durability.",3
1917,"The cups are sturdy, a bit hard to tighten and therefore hard to loosen. I got the green/orange and yellow/red. At first they leaked but I removed the nipple part and put it back in following the instructions that comes with the cups.",4
1918,"This is a bit pricey but thought it would be worth it. The spout collapses into the rubber lid making it very difficult to drink from. I have to keep pulling the spout out. I'd pass on this one. The plus side is that it doesn't leak and teethers might like to chew on the spout.",2
1919,"Great product. Better than new thick wipes bc has less chemicals, use about the same amount per wipe. It can take a couple more for heavy duty messes, using two at once for solid waste seems to be effective. they seem less ""wet"" than many other wipes, probably in part to cloth like material. I don't love the smell of 7th gen cleansers, across the brand, but it's a result of plant based resins. Glad they offer these again. Also good for adult and pet use.",5

1921,"They are so dry!  There is hardly any moisture at all on these wipes.  I find I need to really scrub to clean up poop messes, which makes my son miserable.  We're going to try out other brands...",3
1922,"This product gets 5 stars from me, but the package gets 3: it has a peel-back sticker top that when trying to open and close when you are changing a squirmming baby gets to be a bit of a hassle (you need two hands to do it).  Also, when you replace the sticker to close it, it is difficult to get it to lay flat again, which leaves little folds that allow air in to dry the wipes out.  This would be best placed inside a hard case for wipes, with an easy-open-close lid: just peel the sticker top off and put it inside a hard case, and they will be great!",4
1923,"Not bad.  Thick wipes and not soapy like Earth's Best.",4
1924,"These are great wipes. They feel very clean and non-filmy on your hands, and they do a great job cleaning up any mess our little guy throws at us.We use the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer, and these fit well and pop out nicely (though they do come easier out of the newer pop-up lid version of the wipes warmer, and they sometimes take a little bit more tugging in the other, flip-open lid version). (Incidentally, if you use the Prince Lionheart, Pampers and this Seventh Generation are the best brands in my experience; Huggies and genetic brands always ripped coming through the opening.)We were using Pampers Sensitive Skin, which was nice enough, but I prefer this Seventh Generation option now. Pampers has a more lotion-y feel and smell, which isn't bad, but I prefer how clean and just water-like these Seventh Gen wipes feel. Both do a great job cleaning up any baby messes, but I feel like Seventh Gen stays intact better; the Pampers wipes always seemed to be shedding like fuzzy/linty bits, which weren't necessarily bad, but also aren't helpful.(Our baby is 3mos old and exclusively breastfed, if it matters)",5
1925,"This thing is incredible.  It's simple to put together and use.  It has directions on the box but you really don't need them.  I mean, it's one of those common sense kind of deals.My baby doesn't complain about this as much as the bulb syringe.  It has much better control.  With the bulb you're limited to... well, the bulb capacity.  With the Nosefrida I control the strength and duration of suckage (to a point.)I don't agree with the advice I've seen on plugging the second nostril.  I'd not want to damage my baby's sinus cavities (if that's even possible.)  I'd want to ask a doctor about that before taking the advice.  This thing sucks plenty when used as directed.Though I'll admit, after using this thing I was a little light-headed.",5
1926,"A must-have for all parents!",5
1927,"My baby moved too much. I honestly couldn't hold her still long enough to get the mouth piecein and put it to her nose. I couldnt hold both at the same time (her and nosefrida). Its not for everyone. My baby hates getting her nose cleaned so much. She needs to be held down because she moves so much. So this itemwas not practical for us. Nasal bulb is quicker and more effective.",3
1928,"This works great. But my daughter hated it just as much as she did the nasal bulb. And she is an easygoing baby for sure, so for her to have a conniption is a once in a blue moon event. I guess she was anxious about an unfamiliar hose and pen-like contraption coming toward her face because the would fight, cry, and flail when we tried to use it. When my husband & I started acting like it was a &#34;fun&#34; game - smiling, laughing at the sound, and taking deep breaths and letting out sighs of &#34;refreshment&#34; - my daughter relaxed & smiled, realizing the process was helping her breathe better rather than a punishment. Just don't give up on it the first few uses.",5
1929,"it works wonders! Say good bye to traditional aspirators, dont even waste your time with them. Just buy nosefrida. I know its a little pricey but worth the investment for all your babies. I have had mine for 2 year and I have never had to change the filter, but i know that if i have to , i have plenty of back up. You baby may not like the sensation, but its fast and effective. I will use this for baby #2 when the time comes. Dont hesitate, buy now!",5
1930,"My 7 week old son is a regurgitator and throws up if he's put flat on his back too soon after eating and/or without a very good burp. That said, he is congested quite frequently. Both of us hate the aspirator bulb as I can't tell if it's working so I just keep at it. Maybe it's a gross mom thing, but I LOVE being able to SEE what's coming out of his nose so I know whether or not &#34;I got it&#34; lol...I think this is by far the best little known baby product I've purchased. I use it at least once a day and when I use it with saline drops, I'm able to clean his nose in under 30 seconds...with the aspirator bulb it takes me that long to keep him from moving his head. He cries, but stops immediately when his nose is clear! It's a must-have for any nursery. I'm getting a 2nd for my diaper bag!!!",5
1931,"First, it's not any where near as gross as I thought it would be.  It's great for those stubborn boogies.  My son thinks I'm trying to pull his eyes out through his nostrils.  We've only used this for basic boogies.  Since my son hasn't been sick yet, I haven't put it to the &#34;real&#34; test yet.  However, so far it's performed very well.  Very easy to clean.",5
1932,"I needed a bag to send to daycare for my baby's cloth diapers. The Kanga Care Diaper Wet bag turned out to be the better option for that usecase, it is smaller, has a handle that opens and snaps close. This bag is too big, has handles that don't open and snap so you'd have to tie it on somehow. It would be great for taking when we go swimming or to the beach, will hold the whole family's swim clothes. Just not right for what I intended it for.On the other hand, if you use it at home it will hold many more diapers than the Kanga and you can find a permanent spot and mechanism to tie it down. It's not as easy to open as the Kanga, however.",4
1933,"Love the pattern - so Portlandia&#8230; &#34;put a bird on it&#34;!In all seriousness, the bag works great for cloth diapers, and everything nursing related to minimize odors throughout the day. At the end of the day simply empty the bag and place it along with the contents in the wash and you're done. Simple and less wasteful than a lot of other nursery options.",5
1934,"I got a large one and it's perfect!  We took baby for a weekend away and stored the diapers in here and it held the stink in.  I also like the smaller zippered pocket on the outside too.  I can store her cloth wipes in there, or whatever else.  Great large bag.  We'll be using it for daycare when she goes.",5
1935,"Was hesitant if it would keep the smell contained and that it would eventually get really stinky.  We've been CD for 3 weeks now with our 3 week old baby and have yet to smell anything stinky!  The bag looks cute in the bathroom and nobody knows what it is even for until they see us toss a diaper in.  Washes really well.",5
1936,"Just an incredibly designed product and worth every penny.  We live above a restaurant, so there are only certain days we can put our trash outside (NYC) - so sometimes I'll empty the diaper pail, tie up these bags and the bag will sit in our hallway for 24 hours and there is ZERO odor.Now, when the bag is full in the diaper dekor itself - you'll smell diapers when you open and close the lid - that can't be prevented. But these bags, once tied, are odor proof.",5
1937,"I like the diaper pail itself, although as I stated in my review on the item, it is not very good for #2 diapers as the kids get older and their #2's start to stink. It doesn't keep the stink in as well as other diaper pails.That said, the refills are very easy to use. The instructions are printed on a paper band around the plastic, it has a step by step on how to install and even tells you when it's okay to rip the paper off and continue the instructions. Easy install, and they last me quite awhile as I only use this pail for #1 diapers in the upstairs area of our house, where we don't often change diapers. It's still quite cheap compared to other diaper systems though, and I think it's very easy to use.",5
1938,"But the actual system is so awful that I wouldn't consider ever getting it again.  The diaper dekor has broken after a year and a half of use.  I expect to get multiple years/children out of something like this but the little piece to cut the ends of the bag was first to go (it is just a razor blade that is affixed to inside of the pail but it was useful when we needed to change the bag).  Then the inner lid went.  On top of all of this the system is really not great, and doesn't contain the smell of pee only diapers well.  I would never again purchase this system.  But the refills work fine.",4
1939,"I don't know if I should have forked out the money for a full sized Sophie to experience the magic but this little guy does nothing for my son.",1
1940,"The product is the sophie teether, so it's exactly what you expect it to be, and my son loves it.  I couldn't get my first kid to use a teether, but my second really loves sophie.I didn't need 2, but ordered 2 because it was only a few dollars more.  The good news is that it shipped in two separate packages, so now I have a spare sophie to use for an upcoming shower gift.",5
1941,"This is definitely one of my baby's favorite teethers.  As soon as he could hold things this was a go to.  Has excellent handles and he loves chewing on every part of this giraffe.",5
1942,"These are super cute and super soft. Not very long though. The bear(?) heads add a nice little cushion for my LO to lean on when he is sleeping on car rides. He tugs on them and chews them and they stay attached so the velcro part is very strong. Love these.",5
1943,"I've ordered sets for my car seat. I was so glad I had a set with me when I traveled to the east coast last month.  I rented a car seat from Hertz (will never ever ever do that again), and put these on so the baby's face wasn't touching the straps of the car seat.  He also loves chewing on the little ears:).",5
1944,"Love this to support the babies heads and keep her more comfortable in her baby trend original car seat. It's really helpful.",5
1945,"No spill valve redesign in Spring 2014:  My baby has been using one of these OXO sippy cups for about two months now.  I got this one to save on washing.  Lo and behold, the no spill valves are different and redesigned between the two sippy cups.  The old style had a single rubber piece that fits in the lid and has a one way valve in it.  This new one has a very complicated piece that fits into the lid.Pros of the new valve:  The new valve allows almost free flow of liquid, while the old one was super low flow and took effort to drink from.  I tried drinking out of both.  With the old style, I had to suck hard.  With the new style, I only had to suck a little.  For the old style valve, the idea is that you start the baby with the valve in, and then transition to no valve as soon as baby is coordinated enough not to dump it on himself, and then eventually transition to no lid at all so baby is drinking from a cup.  I think that with this one, you keep the valve in. The new valve really is no spill, and didn't leak when I left the cup on it's side for a few minutes.  They also changed the way the valve attaches to the lid, so that it snaps into place.  With the old style, the valve would fall off randomly leaving a non spill proof cup to dump on baby.  This one the valve hasn't come off.Cons of the new valve:  It just doesn't seem as if I will be able to clean it well.  I am only going to use water with this sippy cup - no formula or juice because of the valve looking hard to clean and me not being able to get to all parts of it.  Another con is that lids and valves are not compatible between the old and new style.  So, the inside of the lid has a different connector to snap it to the valve.  Honestly, this fixes a problem with the old style where the valve fell into the water randomly.  But, if you already have old and new style sippy cups together, then you are going to have to keep the old valve with the old lid, and new valve with new lid.  So, that adds some complexity.General notes on the sippy cup:  Both valves went through the dishwasher (as instructions that came with the cups said they would).  I wash top rack only in a Munchkin dishwasher basket.  The handle part snaps off the cup part.  This takes enough force to get on and off that I don't think the baby will be able to do it for a while.  The handles are secure enough for him to use them to lift the cup and take a drink.",5
1946,"Going on a trip with a 10 month old means planning and trying to bring only what we need. Our baby is moving from the bottle and sees her older sister using a cup so is excited to have her own.. Now I an excited she has her own as well as the cup doesn't leak and keeps her water cold. Really a life saver on a long plane ride followed by a car trip.  Good size, she holds it well.",5
1947,"I really liked the look and feel, but just pay a little more and get the stainless thermos foogo. My son has thrown that one out a car window and its still like new, this one is okay but plastic is just not the same, it makes water smell and if you leave milk in it (I never did my kid refuses milk) the smell will never come out.",3
1948,"This cup has good quality materials and construction. It doesn't leak and it looks like it's going to last a long time. I took off one star because it does not seem to be shaped for little hands as much as some other sippy cup brands. It is a little wide to hold. But in general I would recommend. It is also dishwasher safe but not microwave safe, just FYI.",4
1949,"This cup is one of our top two favorites right now.  Here are some thoughts from our experience:- Flexible straw is easy to drink from for a slightly older baby.  Not a great first cup because the drink can flow too fast up the straw, but once they have the hang of drinking from a straw, it's great.- Shape of the cup is easy for baby to hold.- When the lid is twisted closed, it doesn't really leak at all.- At first, I was concerned about how difficult it would be to keep the lid clean (we're mainly using it for growth milk shakes for our tiny baby), but it's pretty easy to keep clean with a straw brush.Overall, highly recommended for a baby 14 months and up.",5
1950,"Pros: My daughter has loved drinking out of these cups since she was about 12 months old (now 16).  They are light, have clear markings/measurements, look good, open/close easily, and the straw comes apart nicely for cleaning.  With a little tweaking, they could be the perfect cup, but...Cons: They can leak a little, but they are a straw cup, not a sippy, so that is to be expected, and I don't want her to learn to dump her cup upside down anyway, so minor consequences for that action are okay with me.  That's the least of the cons, however.  Worse is that the blue rubber parts on the sides and top of the lid get really grungy and discolored-looking pretty quickly.  I've had the same issue with the bottoms of the OXO tot bowls.  There isn't enough grip-benefit to make grunginess acceptable to me.  Hard plastic would be better.  Worst of all, as mentioned by previous reviewers, is the fact that the lid does not come apart completely for cleaning.  This is a pricey cup, not something you are going to throw away after a few uses, and you should be able to clean it thoroughly.  I like how it works, but I just don't feel okay with not knowing whether there is bacteria/mold growing in there or not.",3
1951,"Bought this for my 10 month old to transition from bottle - took him a few tries but finally got the hang of sipping through straw now he's drinking TONS of water.",5
1952,"I love everything about it.  It was ALMOST perfect. But when our toddler turns it upside down and starts making puddles with the straw -- which is an awesome game, don't you know -- well, that's what make me switch to a Nubi, which really is spill-proof.",4
1953,"We tried many different cups and this is the one my son loves, it's great easy to clean and all that good stuff. However, I have had to replace so many of these cups because they crack when dropped. I wish they were made out of a stronger material.",3
1954,"We've used many many sippy cups. This one leaks everywhere. I would definitely not recommend it and will not be buying more.",2
1955,"We followed the advice of Kenneth M. Saltzman to double-baffle the cup for a slower flow, but it was still too fast. Besides, we had a difficult time getting both baffles to click on properly. Ultimately, we ended up getting aReflo Smart Cup, a Smart Alternative to ""Sippy Cups"" (Clear - 2 Pack)instead, which has a much slower flow.But to be fair, our baby (6-months-old) has an oral aversion, so he doesn't drink or eat like typical babies. We are trying to use a cup for him upon the suggestion of his occupational therapist. Because of health issues, he didn't have the energy to suck and and swallow his milk from a bottle. And when his health issues were resolved, we realized that he actually lost the ability and desire to use the bottle altogether, which is why we're where we are... trying to get him to drink from a cup.So, anyway, my review about the flow being too much may not be fair because of our baby's special circumstance. Be sure to take this into account when making your purchasing choice. We are still going to keep our cups in hopes of being able to use them when Baby gets older and hopefully masters the Reflo Cup.",3
1956,"Im giving this 4 stars only because my daughter did not care too much for this cup although if she had, it would be an ideal transition cup. I love that it has the oz printed on the cup and comes with a spill minimizer that is removable when the time comes.",4
1957,"The handles make it very easy for my toddler to pick up and drink from it. As others have noted, the valve pops off easily and will float in the liquid. Pretty much every time it is dropped hard this will happen.  The cup scratches easily too. The bottom of the cup where you attach the handles scratches really bad just from popping it on and off.  I would say it is ideal for just learning to use a sippy but not once they are walking and toting it around.",3
1958,"You can't microwave them.  Not an issue at home, because we try to avoid microwaving plastic anyway, but I wanted to send them to daycare (because they don't allow glass), and now I can't use them for anything that needs to be heated up.  Also, I wish the lids fastened a little more securely and that the rubber on the bottom didn't discolor so easily.",3
1959,"I like the size and shape and really like that they are microwavable.  My only complaint is that they aren't clear.  I like to be able to look in the fridge and not have to take the lid off of everything to find what I'm looking for.",4
1960,"It's a spoon. Functions as a spoon. Wish they had clear cover colors available too, but wasn't available when we made our purchase.",5
1961,"These are the best spoons and forks for toddlers.  We have been using them since my son was 2 and he is now 4.  They look brand new and have been washed in dishwasher many times (top rack).  I give these as gifts all of the time.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy again and again.",5
1962,"My two year old has been using this spoon and fork for the last six months.  They are easy for her to hold, easy to scoop or piece, and fit nicely inside her mouth.  They are also dishwasher safe. After six months of use, they still look brand new.  My three year old niece and four year old nephew have also used them.  When I ask my nephew if he wants a big fork or this fork, he always wants to use this set.  I like them so much that I am ordering another set.",5
1963,"great transition feeding set for babies ready to move onto toddler sized utensils.is a touch on the larger side, but is great for spooning out those harder textured foods.",5
1964,"OXO, i love you. any product you make i will most certainly buy.OXO baby products are so brilliant. this bottle brush comes with a screw off handle that has a pacifier cleaner. i could kiss you.",5
1965,"Love just wish it held up longer, as in we go through one of these about every 2-3 months. Maybe we just wash a lot, either way I don't mind. I love that it is standing and not touching anything to cross contaminate etc. Great buy.",5
1966,"We originally purchased the Munchkin bottle brush, which broke after a few months and never stayed upright. This one works much better.",5
1967,"The brush is soft, sturdy, and easy to clean.  It fits most bottles.  However, the nipple cleaner is entirely useless. You take off the handle and you're left with a long plastic stub that is solid and not flexible.  It fits into the nipples but is too narrow to actually do anything. I find that sticking my finger into the nipple and rubbing around to be much more effective.",4
1968,"Soft bristles makes it easy to fit into small spots and it cleans! fits even in those 60oz skinny breastmilk collection tubes. Aside from bottles and nipples, i use it to clean breastpump flanges. I love the handy stand which collects dripping water, and the nipple cleaner is hidden in the handle. I purchased the boon grass drying rack and it matches great together! Prefer it over munckin and tommee tippee bottle brushes.",5
1969,"I tried a Sassy brush and really didn't like it since it didn't work at all, then I tried a brush from munchkin which I liked, but I had to replace it every two months since the sponge tore.Now I bought this brush. At first it looked too big for my Medela bottles, but once I used it, it fit perfectly because of the flexible bristles.I still use the small nipple brush from the munchkin brush though.",5
1970,"the stand is gold. i got some other bottle brushes sans stands, and they ended up getting neglected because i didn't want them getting contaminated by my sponges and brushes that clean raw chicken. any OXO baby product, buy. you won't be disappointed.",5
1971,"This bottle brush is effective. It's super soft, so it doesn't scratch the plastic cups and bottles. The stand is great, so it doesn't get gross and can dry out. Plus it has a little tool in the handle which is great.",5
1972,"After only a few weeks, the top of the brush became smashed down and hasn't really recovered.  While I expected there to be some movement of the bristles, I didn't expect that the entire thing would collapse after just a few uses.  Major disappointment.  I'd rather use my Munchkin brush that has a sponge at the end.",2
1973,"I love that it is easy to wipe down and folds up well, also provides a little padding. Would purchase it again for sure.",5
1974,"Great as additional pad for diaper bag. Pad wipes off easily and has Velcro tab to keep folded. Fits in laptop sleeve of a backpack nicely.",4
1975,"We love the spoon and fork but I agree with other reviewers that it would have been nice to have a lid for the plate.",4
1976,"baby like it ,the colors are pleasing and they are easy to use and clean.It is BPA, phthalate and PVC free, which is important for your child's health.",5
1977,"Yes, it's just an ice tray with a cover. The molds are 3/4 of an ounce which is a perfect portion for baby food.",4
1978,"Making the baby food is a lot easier than some of the storage systems but this one seems to have a great idea with mass production and freezing then using proportional sizes.  You absolutely do need more than one for each type of food you are freezing but the price is in line with the idea and very cost effective compared to purchased food",5
1979,"If this bottom of this product was just flat, it would probably work fine.  However, it has a little raised ring on the bottom, I'm assuming to help it seal better.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit our tub.",2
1980,"I love this gate for a few reasons.1. it's high quality. doesn't seem cheap or flimsy. it sturdy and holds strong and looks really nice. the color works well in our house.2. it can automatically swing shut or stay open - we don't always need our gate closed so it's great that we have the option to keep it open so we don't have to manually unlatch every time we need to go through it. And the fact it can swing shut is great too.3. It's pretty easy to open - push button, and lift. You can also turn and it locks it. So it has a few options depending on how secure you need it to be4. it was pretty easy to install",5
1981,"These are my favorite fitteds. I use the bamboo at night for my little guy who sleeps 10-13 hours. Even the cotton with a bamboo or hemp booster works well at night for us. I recommend them to everyone. They're one of the few fitteds that has fit my long-waisted and chubby baby well. They do run a tad large, IMO, so I'd recommend sizing down if your baby is between sizes.",5
1982,"We've had this seat for about a year now and we love it. Our son loves it because of the cow hide print. It is easy to install, uninstall, and clean. My son (4 years old) can buckle himself in with ease and the cup holders are a creature comfort that are probably now deal breakers in any subsequent seat purchase.",5
1983,"This a great bag for snacks and milk. I love the look. If your child needs a full size lunch or you use lots of little containers for food, this lunch bag is not big enough.I have to bring a snack and milk everyday for my toddler for daycare and that is about all that can fit in this lunch bag. I will have to look for something else for his full lunch.He loves carrying it, and its so cute. Easy to identify of course.",4

It washes well and hasn't worn out at all. I can put a mini bento box that's about 8"" x 5"" and a couple ice packs as well (I only use icepacks for some lunches).I was able to iron-on a name tag on the front (on the dark blue) that looks really good. I used theEpson LabelWorks LW-300 Label Maker (C51CB69010)iron-on labels, which I highly recommend for labeling kids clothes and gear, it's still going strong!Love this lunchbox. I suspect it'll make it through the preschool years, but like other's have said, it maybe too small for older kids.",5
1988,"This is the second bag I bought. The first one, I purchased it for my daughter and this one I bought it for my friend's son. They are very cute, practical, and easy to clean too. My daughter loved at at first sight. She carries it to daycare by herself every day. I highly recommend it. The top had a handle with a clip. So it can be hanged easily on the stroller handle/bar.",5
1989,"These lunch bags are great.  Solidly constructed, easy enough for the kids to open on their own, keeps food decently cold.The only potential drawback is that you should expect many other kids to have the same bags (because they are so cute) so you need to write the kids' names in them.",5

1991,"This little step stool is perfect for our just-turned-two-year-old to use at the sink in the bathroom.  He also loves to carry it over to the washing machine and watch me put clothes in.  It is solidly built, and heavy enough not to tip over, but light enough that my son can carry it short distances all by himself.  The legs have little rubber pieces on the bottom to keep it from sliding around.  The wood is beautiful, and will still be nice to have around once my son outgrows it, unlike the themed plastic kids step stools.We did need to buy a faucet extender so that my son can reach his hands into the water by himself, but I still think this stool is a good height; if he were to take a tumble from it, barring landing in a weird way, I think he would be fine after a couple of kisses to make it all better :)  If it were taller, it would be more difficult for him to get up by himself, and it might be more dangerous for him, in terms of injuries from falling from it (he's a toddler, he's bound to fall off eventually, though he hasn't yet).",5

My house has already been taken over by toys the last thing I want to look at is more kid colored things in my bathroom. It looks great and is very functional. My two year old uses this to help reach the potty with no issues. It came assembled which was an added plus. Have had it for a few months now and it still looks brand new.",5

It comes with extra cards in case you make a mistake but once I did the foot, the hand came out spotty and there wasn't enough ink to redo it.

1997,"My son was born in November, and this was a LIFESAVER.  We love being outside, and this not only protected from the elements (snow/wind), but acted almost as a little &#34;greenhouse.&#34;  There are, obviously, holes in it to allow air in and out, but it keeps a good amount of warm air in",5
1998,"This thing is a lifesaver!!  It fits my Britax BeSafe carseat perfectly.  The elastic on bottom holds it down and kept my baby dry in the heaviest rain.  My goodness and it's affordable!!  I love that I don't have to spend a ton to accessorize for wet weather because the stroller car seat combos are so pricey already.",5
1999,"This review is for size 2. I never thought I'd end up preferring prefolds over pocket diapers but I do. My son is now 1 year old.  I found that prefolds are the most consistently reliable- no leaks, rarely a blow out. Particularity in the first few months these fit him the best.Just a few quick notes:-I did use size 2 from 15 pounds. It looks a little funny, and you do have to fold over a lot of extra material but I did it. The extra material is actually helpful because babies are drinking so much at that point. Up until 6-9 months he could go 3-4 hours in this if he didn't poop. Now at 12 months I need to change this diaper every 2-3 hours. I'm a stay at home mom and I've gotten used to it. It helps that I know how much money I've saved.-I really like being to use any detergent I want, nothing special.(yes I know some people do anyway but I haven't found it necessary) I wash every 3 days. I do a quick rinse, then the regular hot wash with extra rinse.  And I have an top loading HE machine that barely uses any water, which i don't recommend buying. However it does manage to get my ozocozy diapers clean.  I use Purex mountain green OR All free and clear. We switched to All because my son has mild eczema. I never needed to strip or do any special to get these smelling fresh.-I use a Snappi with a large Thirsties velcro cover over this prefold. I hate fiddling with the snap covers that a lot of people seem to like.-These prefolds never squeeze out pee as long as you change it within reasonable time. (This has happened with microfiber insert that come with pocket diapers). They feel soft and warm when wet. My son seems as comfortable in these as a disposable.-We did use a disposable at night for the first few months because these regular cotton prefolds couldn't keep him dry enough for 8+ hours. I wouldn't expect them to though. Now once he was 9 months I switched him to pocket diapers at night with a hemp soaker in it. This works.  Let just say again though, the one size pocket diapers didn't fit him well until 6-9 months. The pocket diapers were leaking up until this point and I got tired of it. If it weren't for the osocozy prefolds I would have given up and gone to disposables all day when he was a newborn.- Overall, the ozocosy cotton prefold rocks and kept me cloth diapering. If I had totally invested in one size pockets it would have been a disaster. I really suggest trying these for a few weeks if your thinking about it and only getting 3-4 pockets as a comparison.",5
2000,"These are for an upcoming grandchild, cotton-cloth diapers,  just what the parents wanted they are looking forward to using them soon.",5
2001,"I'm new to cloth diapering, but these are very soft and seem pretty absorbent.  Of course, cloth diapers aren't as absorbent as disposables but these are pretty good.",4
2002,"These hold up fantastic in the wash. be advised:  they do shrink a small amount in the first initial washes to prep before use.",4
2003,"Super absorbent! I use them as burp cloths and they are the best. They are kind of an ugly, dull vanilla/light tan color anyway, so I don't feel compelled to smother them in Oxiclean when they get stained. They shrink a little when dried and wrinkle a little which makes them a pain to fold. But I truly don't care about any of that because I don't have to go through 3 burp cloths in one day thanks to these. I can't see them being used as diapers because of the shrinking, but I don't use cloth diapers at all, so I am not knowledgable enough about them to be a reliable source.",5
2004,"I like the designs, but you have to buy two sets in the different sizes.  They seems a bit stiff and were my least favorite.  GroVia is much better and more adjustable.",3
2005,"Easily adjusted, cute prints, LOVE the double gussets. For real. These covers are very well made and you can tell as soon as you pick it up. Very happy with the quality. A little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for with these.",5
2006,"We have tried many brands of covers, and we have settled on the Thirsties Due Wrap with the snaps (along with some Flips).  We use it both with prefolds and the Thirsties Fab Fitted.  (I should throw in we've had trouble with Thirsties wraps with velcro-- the velcro tucked in against my baby's tummy and left a red mark.) The best feature is the double gusset around the legs that means these things have never leaked on us.  The waist is also fitted nicely so that it gently tucks over the edge of the prefold so no part of it can peep out and cause a leak.  The adorable pattern doesn't hurt!!  Definitely recommend.",5
2007,"I got one of these to splurge and mostly bought AssuntaStore's much cheaper similar covers. This cover is my LEAST favorite. It doesn't fit as well and leaks a lot more often than the other covers. We started using it at 9 lbs but could use the other covers from birth. But even at 12lbs, it still doesn't fit right and leaks. If I could do it over, I'd have bought more Assunta covers and skipped thirsties all together. It's the one that we only use if ALL the other covers are dirty.",3
2008,"I like thirsties and yes I'm a first time mom whom is cloth diapering. It keeps  my son's stool and urine locked in and nothing comes out onto his clothes which is a good thing.  I give it three stars because my only complaint is that when he does have a dirty diaper, it sometimes leaks from the cloth diaper onto the shell. Additionally, since leg rims are white, it stains. I'm a clean freak so the stains around the leg rim bothers me.",3
2009,"My son has been wearing these long before he was a year (he's 97 percentile in everything) and they still fit even as he nears his 2nd birthday, they don't leak, they clean up nicely, I can count on my fingers how many times he's had diaper rash in two years and thats awesome. These are great over night diapers too, I made my own inserts out of microfiber cloths and old fleece blankets I bought for a buck at the thrift shop. Saving me huge and protecting his little skin from chemicals in disposable diapers. LOVE LOVE LOVE",5
2010,"I love this cover. We are still using it at 11 pounds, and still on the smallest setting. My baby is slender, but it would work for a chunkier baby too. Prefolds aren't our favorite diaper option, but when we do use them, this is our go to cover.",5
2011,"So i didn't really like them after the first use. After about 2 weeks now i am starting to like them . I used pocket diapers before so i didn't like the idea of not having a liner/pocket fabric. Now i actually like that feature - it makes it way easier to clean and faster to dry. I love the front elastic, it benefits me a lot because my kids are belly sleepers. I would not recomend the same brand of inserts.  The reason i got this diaper is because the one size are just too big. Size one fits my 3 mo and my 20 mo (23lb) , it looks better ,fits more snug and holds the insert in place.",4
2012,"A little tough to open/shut, but that's a good thing when you have a kid. The low profile makes it the easiest snack container to put into my purse. And it's harder for my daughter to spill so I can give it to her in the car with less chance of dropping her snacks.",5
2013,"The lid does not create a tight seal thus snack will go stale in just a day. And when dropped, the translucent top half and the white bottom half separates. I'm not sure why they did not make this one piece container with a lid.",2
2014,"This is a beautiful, easy to clean high chair. I hate high chairs with vinyl fabric to collect gunk. This chair wipes down easily. I detached and hand-washed the straps a couple of times and they cleaned up well. The wood base makes it heavier and not very prone to tipping. The tray depth, seat and foot rest heights are easy to adjust. It's almost elegant, as you might expect from OXO.The tray does trap water if you're not careful. It seems to be made for hand-washing.My major complaint is that the velcro for the seat cushions failed after about a year. I bought replacement velcro from a craft store but it doesn't really hold the cushion in place very well. That being said, the chair has held up well and still looks great after 2 years of use.",4
2015,"Bought this for when I travel. I was worried that there wouldn't be a post to stop baby sliding down but there is, and it's optional whether you blow it up or not so you can use it for an older child too. I used this before my baby could even sit up and it worked fine.",5
2016,"my son hate this thing, then he love it, then i hate it!now.... he can't bathes without it.when we travel we just deflated it and compress as small as we can and pack it in out luggage. MUST BRING A SMALL PUMP WITH YOU TO MAKE BLOWING IT UP A LITTLE EASIER. YOU CAN BLOW IT WITH YOUR BREATHS BUT BY THE TIME YOU DONE IT TIME TO GO HOME.",5
2017,"I bought this inflatable tub because the hard, plastic tub we were using seemed really uncomfortable for my little one. The horn in this tub is much kinder on my little one's bottom, but still keeps her upright and not slipping all over the place. You can also use the tub without the horn blown up so there is more room to splash around. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a bit hard to fill. The sides are pretty bulky, which is good for comfort, but bad for spouts to reach over. A lot of water is diverted from actually filling the tub, so I use a big jug to fill it instead. I would prefer to directly fill the tub, but it's a minor inconvenience.",4
2018,"I give my 7 month old daughter baths in this and she loves it.  I fill it up in the kitchen sink and keep it on the counter.  I clean her up and she plays and splashes... it is a win-win.  When I want to drain the water, I simple slide the tub drain over the kitchen sink and it drains while my daugher is still in the tub.  I started using this when my daughter was about 5 months... it's be great!",5
2019,"Don't get too worried with the negative reviews on this product.  I bought these because we had been through all the named brand top of the line bottles and my daughter hated each of them.  My Nana said &#34;get some basic Evenflo bottles and be done with it.&#34; So glad I listened.  She took to these bottles instantly.  I hand wash, boil, and wash in the dishwasher and they have held up great.  Very pleased with the bottles.  This 12pk is a great buy at $10!  It will last us until she is ready for the sippy cup.",5
2020,"I was hoping to keep this in my car as an emergency potty but it is so small my son won't even sit on it.",3
2021,"I am very unsatisfied with this mattress becs it is so loud when i put my baby down and when he rolls around.  I contacted the vendor and they admit to a product defect.  Will not be purchasing anything from this vendor again.  email response:To answer you question, the noise you are hearing when you put your babyon the mattress is because the coils were built too close and overlap alittle bit, but please be assured that there is no safety issue.Nothing worse then losing sleep becs your 3 month old is waking constantly becs of loud coils.",1
2022,"I needed these larger jars as my milk supply increased so I wouldn't have to stop mid-pump and get more jars. They helped so much.",5
2023,"I didn't notice when I bought these, but they come pre-sterilized so you don't need to wash or boil before first use. That was kind of nice as I needed to use them right away.",5
2024,"Came fast and in great shape. I am so glad that I could order only the things that I needed and no have to order packages with parts that I didnt need.",5
2025,"We bought this for our new grandson to use for bath time and to put in kiddie pool.  The only problem is that he keeps sliding down.  Seems we are constantly pulling him up.  Would work better if there was a strap or seat was less taught so baby's bottom would sit lower.",1
2026,"Very cute and durable. Great for infants at night because they are easy to find. My daughter is almost a year old and still loves hers.",5
2027,"I bought this when my son was a couple weeks old because he favored soothie pacifiers and I loved the idea of being able to more easily find the pacifier, having something my son could hold onto, and having something that sort of propped up the pacifier while he was too young to keep it in his mouth well enough on his own.This has met all those expectations wonderfully! I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy! I can imagine him loving this for a long time, long after outgrowing pacifiers.Best purchase. I don't know how I would have made it through the infant months without these!!!",5
2028,"I love this pacifier, its cute and really helped our newborn keep the paci in when it kept falling out. However she has since decided that she really does not like pacifiers so we really haven't used it much in the past 2 months. If you have a paci baby though I highly recommend a wubbanub. I will say however that the picture is a little deceiving and its not quite as big as it looks but perfect for little hands.",5
2029,"Wubbanub is a great product.  My son absolutely loves his Geoffrey Giraffe!  It helps him find his paci at night time and nap time if he wants it so i don't have to hunt it down!  Plus keeps it from getting lost around the house too!  This is his second one.  The first one lasted for a year.  I have no complaints on this.  It washes well as well!",5
2030,"I'm in love with this passifier.  My son likes this one a lot but the monkey is his favorite.  It is great from birth through 6 months or older.  It helps him keep it in place.  He is even learning to put back in his mouth himself.",5
2031,"Great because it stays put in babies mouth. Bad because it's hard to wash, would be Muhammad easier if stuffed giraffe could be detached. Also stuffing comes out of giraffe and gets on babies hands which of course go into their mouths.",2
2032,"My daughter loves hers! She will not sleep without or take a regular soothie anymore. I had to order a few more for back up",5
2033,"My 14-mo old loves the whole series of these pacis. We also have a cat. We keep this as a crib pacifier, so he associates sleep time with this. It is soft, easy for baby to grab at any age, we had it for over a year and it looks as new. It washes easy. No smells or ripped seams so far, so I would rate workmanship as very good. It is light and the size is about 5 in long.",5
2034,"This is a must have! We bought a bunch of different pacifiers but the bebe would only take the Soothie that she was given at the hospital. However, she was not able to keep it in her mouth so she kept losing it (and screaming). I was going insane! Then my saviour arriveD - the WubbaNub! Bebe loves it and I love it. Finally, I don't have to give her the paci every 5 seconds. It helps the baby keep the pacifier in her mouth and it's easy to find when it does fall out. The stuffed animal is adorable. It's our bebe's first friend. She absolutely loves it. I just wish I found out about it sooner (it was a looooonnnng couple of weeks without the WubbNub).We have the giraffe and the duck. The duck is cuter but the giraffe works better, in my opinion. It's a little bigger, so it's easier for the baby to hold and it does a better job at keeping the paci in baby's mouth.No matter which stuffed animal you pick, make sure you buy two WubbaNubs because when you have to wash it, it takes a while to dry. I've learned it the hard way!",5
2035,"I purchased the WubbaNub Giraffe for my 3 month old as a possible solution to his pacifier falling out as he&#8217;s falling asleep and him rooting around to find it and waking himself up. I saw the negative reviews and had concerns but all the positive reviews swayed me and I took a leap of faith to purchase.Well it arrived in super-fast time thanks to Amazon Prime, however the Giraffe and pacifier are so poor quality I&#8217;m returning immediately.The packaging arrived intact, though it looked a cheaply printed, I&#8217;ve never seen these in stores but would love to compare packaging to check if this is authentic. The pacifier part is a joke. It&#8217;s tiny and not the standard AVENT soothie given to you at the hospital or that you can buy in stores. My main concern was that without opening the packaging, I could see that the giraffe body had holes in it and the stuffing was coming out. The stitching along the spine of the giraffe was very shoddy and loose and would fall apart within days, if not sooner.This item is potentially a serious choking hazard and SHOULD NOT be sold for babies or children. Amazon needs to stop selling these or at least verify quality/supplier. Maybe a few year's ago this was a good quality item but based on recent reviews on Amazon something has changed.",1
2036,"I love this wet bag for dirty cloth diapers on the go. It held in all the moisture and never smelled through. After some time, the liner began to come away from the bag on the inside, but I am pretty sure I didn't follow the instructions for laundering. I would throw it in with the diapers or regular laundry so it might have lasted longer if I didn't screw around with the temperature of the water or the soaps. My son eventually got a hold of it and tore a little piece of the liner out so I can't use it anymore. But I would definitely recommend to anyone who does cloth diapering on the go and who can follow directions. :O)",5
2037,"I've been using this nail trimmer on my baby for four months now.  I absolutely love that it is gentle and does not hurt whatsoever (it is a soft vibration to the touch, which is perfect for newborn babies).  It did an amazing job filing my little one's nails during the first couple months.  However, after a few months her nails weren't as soft to file and it seemed to take so much longer to file.  I tried switching to the tougher grit discs, which did not seem to help much.  The file was still comfortable to the touch, however my little one would get annoyed after I filed just a couple nails because it took so long and she didn't want to have her hand still for that long.  I finally purchased a pair of nail scissors (the piyo piyo baby nail ones) and have used those to cut her nails, and then I smooth out the edges with the Zo-li buzz nail trimmer. I've found this to be the best of both worlds.  I would definitely recommend this product in regards to the softness (you are definitely not going to hurt your baby or damage the skin with it), however if you're not crazy about the price I think you could definitely get away with carefully using baby scissors instead.",3
2038,"I have tried all kinds of vitamin D drops for my infant twins and I found that these are the easiest to use by far!1 drop is the dose and it has no taste so they don't spit it out!  I put it on the nipple of the bottle or the binky and they take it like a champ!Excellent product!",5
2039,"When our doctor recommended that we give our baby vitamin D drops, we went to the pharmacy and were told to use the Enfamil brand. I have no idea why would any pharmacist recommend that?! We did not know any better so we got the Enfamil D drops. Ugh, they are full of junk! Good thing we checked the reviews. We ordered Baby Ddrops immediately. So much better!",5
2040,"Purchased after using another product that smelled and tasted absolutely disgusting. Baby didn't seem to mind but I couldn't understand why they were so pungent. I switched to this and I'm so glad I did. Just one little drop provides the same amount of vitamin D without the extra ingredients. Wonderful product.",5
2041,"Easy to clean, perfect fit in his crate, and I can get some playpen sheets to cover it for easier cleaning.  It's cheaper and better than a dog bed.  For some reason since I switched him to this bed, he hasn't been compelled to tear his dog bed up.  I am not sure if it's because he's grown out of it or he just likes it so much he doesn't want to eat it but saves me a lot of money from replacing dog beds that get gross.",4
2042,"The case material is soft, but it doesn't look very nice once on the pillow. the opening is very loose looking - would be nice if it overlapped - looks sloppy and cheap",2
2043,"I bought this to fit the &#34;A little Pillow Company&#34; toddler pillow. It fits fine except for that it is a little short so you can see the pillow sticking out, but I love how soft it is and it goes with my daughter's crib decor.",4
2044,"I had purchased an IKEA infant pillow for my almost two year old daughter.  The IKEA pillow case is pretty rough, so I wanted to find something different.  This pillow case is very soft and I really do like the material.  However, the pillow case is small, and it shrinks after washing.  The pillow case no longer covers the entire pillow.  I big disappointment - still searching for another option.  To BabyVision - I would have purchased more if the case had worked.",2
2045,"Unless you have a doll-sized pillow, do not buy this cover.  It shrinks a lot in the wash!! Yes, fabric is soft but no good if you can't cover your toddler pillow. I bought 2 covers and have to use both to cover each side of the pillow to get some use out of the covers.",1
2046,"These were far better than what I was expecting.  I thought I would have to replace these with continued use.  My daughter is nine months old.  I use these daily to wash her face in the mornings, clean her up after meals, and during baths.  They still feel and look like new.",5
2047,"I like these better than my son does, so far.  He hasn't bonded with them at all, but I don't think that's the product's fault.  They're very soft and snuggly.  The blanket square is smaller than I expected it to be, but it's all a good size for a 6-8 month old baby.  I've washed them all a few times and they seem to still be as good as new.  So far no complaints except that the baby doesn't seem to be into them.",5
2048,"These sippy cups leak from time to time, especially when dropped from the highchair.  The spout is time consuming to get back in the lid in the exact position necessary to prevent major leaks from happening as well. Save your money and husband's sanity and get a lower maintenance sippy...Tommee Tippee have been better for us.",2

2050,"The title pretty much says it all.  This was perfect for talking my daughter's Dr. Brown's 8-oz bottles to daycare, with room in the part on top for cereal/pureed food containers, spoon, etc.  But the outside gets dirty pretty easily and the inside is a pain to wipe out, especially the seams/corners.  I finally broke down and put it through the washing machine because it was really grimy on the outside, and that helped a little, but it is still stained.",4
2051,"It is tall enough to fit the fully assembled Dr. Brown bottles, and that's the reason I bought it - so it gets 4 stars from me.  I would have given it five if the zipper was a little sturdier.  It just feels a little cheap, and it's a little hard to zip it closed sometimes.  I've been careful with it though, and it hasn't ripped or anything.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks to take bottles back & forth from daycare and it's holding up nicely.  The top compartment is big enough for me to carry his sippy cup and a snack, or sometimes I stuff an extra outfit up there.  The ice pack that it comes with is okay, but it seems like it gets a little slimy by the end of the day after sitting in the cooler all day, and I prefer the freezer packs that are just water inside anyway, for putting with my baby bottles, so I usually don't use their ice pack.",4
2052,"I am using these for burp cloths. I found the prefold gerber or prefold dundee are much more absorbent. These Bumkins cloths are much more nicely made than my other burp cloths (nicer seams and finished all the way versus strings hanging everwhere). But they just aren't as absorbent and when washed shrunk more than my gerber or dundee ones.",3
2053,"These are wonderful!!!  They will hold up through countless washes and usages.  For the price, you won't be able to find better quality prefolds.  I use these every day, several times a day, and they are incredibly absorbent and soft.",5

The first day, she literally spent about 4-5 hours &#34;talking&#34; and playing with this octopus, with breaks just to nurse and change her diapers. Anything other than playing with the octopus was upsetting to her :) she even skipped her nap.We washed it and dried inside a pillow case and it still looked great, though you might have to readjust the stuffing inside the tentacles once it dries. #octopusproblems",5

2059,"This works even better than a swaddling blanket! You are able to get your child swaddler much faster and with little repositioning, which decreases the chance of pissing off your infant in the process of swaddling them.According to Dr Karp(&#34;Happiest Baby on the Block&#34;), its legs are not that important when swaddling, its the arms. On warmer days, we dont tuck our childs legs into the pouch, we lay her ontop. This way, her arms are swaddled but her legs are free.I highly reccomend this over a swaddling blanket for the convenience.",5
2060,"These are great as a next size up from the newborn ones. Perfect if your little one is growing but still needs to be swaddled! They stay closed and wash well. Love the color choices too!",5
2061,"Its easy to use and was very useful to me when my little one was just born. It snugs very well and helped by child to sleep properly. Would highly recommend this product.",5
2062,"We picked these up for our son to sleep in. He had really bad colic and would only even think about stopping screaming if he was swaddled up tight. We usually used aden + anais blankets during the day, but those would come loose at night.We found the SwaddleMe wraps and they work great as sleepers.Another word of advice: People seem to think you need to slowly ease a baby out of these by taking one arm out, then the other, then take them out of the whole thing (as they can start turning over). We went cold turkey. A night or two of significant fussing later, and our son never needed to be swaddled anymore. We switched him to the Halo Sleepsack after he got too active at night.Note: Use common sense with all baby things. If your baby can turn over to their stomach in these, that could be a Bad Thing. We initially had our son in an angled bassinet and these worked great then. Once we moved him to his crib and he moved around too much, we ditched the SwaddleMe so he'd never face plant with no way to move.",4
2063,"My son would try to move his arms up and out of it and get stuck in uncomfortable positions. Also, in the process of trying to move his arms out, the swaddle would come up to his face and nose (which could cause suffocation). I never used these - waste of money!",1
2064,"Our baby is a tough cookie...Came out screaming and is strong already...I am good at the manual swaddle with any swaddling blanket but my skills are no match for super baby and her wild strength!! These swaddles are perfect as the securtiy is unwaivering as the velcro holds the tidy folds and safely bundles our joy.  Very high recommend on these swaddles.  have tried many other varieties but this takes the prize due to ease of use, softness and provision of a tidy swaddle!",5
2065,"I loved the first two SwaddleMe wraps that I used for my daughter, but I needed more so I purchased the 3-pack. What a disappointment! They were definitely not the same quality that the first two had been. They were very thin and much smaller...so much smaller that they were too small for my daughter but I had already washed them. I would recommend purchasing SwaddleMe wraps individually because they seemed to be higher quality that way, and I loved the first two we had.",2
2066,"I have yet to find a sleeping bag I like more than Baby Deedee. I love that they are cotton and not polyester like some bags. This way they breathe and my son doesn't get sweaty. I also like that they are armless. Again, this helps to keep him from overheating. In the winter I simply put a long sleeve onesie on him and his arms stay warm enough. When he was a preemie, the smallest size was too large on him, so I took two safely pins and made the arm holes smaller and they worked great.",5
2067,"Great for winter sleeping and much easier to use than the sleep sacks without the shoulder snaps. We bought a large for next winter's use too!",5
2068,"My son loves this. Especially at night he sees pics upon the ceiling. Makes him calm down and helps him sleep.",5
2069,"I bought this bouncer for my son and have used it for several months now. One thing to note is that the parts are not very high quality and it was a little difficult to assemble because the screws kept stripping the plastic. Also, the colors are very very bright and are brighter in person than the pictures show. Though I do have to say that it works well and my son does enjoy sitting in it for short periods of time. The side handles are also a nice feature and they do make it easy to put the baby in and take him out of the bouncer.",3
2070,"It's portable and raises my twins enough for them to be seated fine using the seat belt but the installation itself it's a nightmare and it takes forever, especially if you're using them while traveling taking cabs.",3
2071,"Perfect for my 5yr old son so that I can have my oldest with no seat my daughter in a convertible seat and now this seat. My son loves it he says it's so comfortable and he has no problem strapping himself. We have used it to send when he goes on play dates great seat!",5
2072,"Why didnt I think of this product!! With families with muliptle children in safety seats the bubblebum is a lifesaver for those tight backseat issues, Before finding this my husband and I were worried about how we would fit our newborn in with our two boys age 6 and 2 into our 2013 nissan altima and 08 audi. We thought we would have to swap in our lease for a bigger car which we realllly didnt want to do. I was hesitant just becuase an inflatable booster seat didnt sound safe  but after reading so many reviews and making sure that this product is an approved booster seat I decided to try it out and Im so glad I did. Our son loves this seat!! he says its very comfortable. a great find!",5
2073,"highly recommend this, super compact, narrow, and easy to inflate and use. will buy another when my younger one is ready. easily fits between two large carseats in backseat of small suv",5
2074,"I have been using this pillow for my daughter for the past 6 months and I love it. It has been a great place to put her down and is easy to wash. It's also been really great for traveling as it give her some place to sleep. I am beyond sad that she is getting to big for it and can now roll out of it. I definitely think it will be a great pillow for her as she gets older though as my 2 1/2 year old likes to sit in it to watch tv.",5
2075,"I used these until my twins were about 6 months old.  Most babies may outgrow earlier but my babies were preemies and didn't roll around until then.  They keep the babies happy and comfortable",5
2076,"I haven't ever written a review, but I feel that this toy deserves one. My baby has his selection of toys, he has the classic Sophie the giraffe, the winkel, and other Lamaze and rattle like toys. This penguin is his absolute favorite. I can tell when he gets bored of his toys and I will bring his penguin out and squeak it once and his face lights up and he turns to the sound.In the description it says it squeaks when shaken, I haven't notice that. You actually squeeze the little rod. It's easy enough to squeak that my 5 month old son can do it on his own.I think the thing he loves most about it is the shape of the head and beak. I'm not sure if it reminds him of eating, but he just gnaws on it all day. It's very soft head and the arms are that crinkly texture that babies love. It's a great toy if you're looking for one. Doesn't look like much, but it's been the winner in my house.",5
2077,"These are the only ones I used. They are soft and were not showing though clothing. I highly recommend these.",5
2078,"I got these for a vacation so we could just throw them away when they were used.  We ended up keeping many of them and washing them in the hotel because they were pretty good quality.  I have a 10 month old, so I did have to poke holes in the nipple with a safety pin because they were slow flow and he was getting frustrated!",5
2079,"By far my favorite Convertible seat we have owned.  Great looking, easy to buckle (I've had problems with others), very soft cloth.  My only complaint is that it is not washable in the machine.  We have to scrub it with an upholstery cleaner which isn't the greatest but I honestly still love it.",5
2080,"My boy LOVES this carrier! He seems to be very comfortable. It is easy to wear and easily adjusts. Perfect for babies below 15 months. Anything more, I think he would be too big for this.However, it is not as soft as our Baby Bjorn carrier belowhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JOSNM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0009JOSNM&linkCode;=as2&tag;=justckem-20",5
2081,"I would expect more from a $100+ carrier, but this one surpasses my expectations at this pricepoint.  We knew we would use our backpacking carrier once our daughter could be remotely upright (5 months), so we just needed a carrier to get us to that point.  I researched them all (excluding wraps) and settled on this one.  I would've done it again.  It was safe, snug, somewhat easy to use, and reasonably comfortable.My husband wore it more because my front was sore in those earlier months I was breastfeeding and had had a C-section and because he didn't mind the straps as much, which are pretty thin.  I had to help him put it on quite a few times before he could get it, and even then he still preferred help.My daughter couldn't sit in it until a month or 6 weeks of age--she would hunch over and cry.",5
2082,"i had bought Infantino Ergonomics baby carrier which is much better , he was able to sit in it, not liek this one puts too much pressure on his poor little legs. when I use this one, he legs would turn red or even purple at time.",2
2083,"I can't vouch for use yet, as the baby is too little but purchased it as a gift for a new addition and the recipient was very happy.  It looks well made and sturdy so no safety worries and its pretty cute for baby too.",5
2084,"This is buy for my husband, let him have a good with children, ha ha, should be very handsome, do a super milk dad",5
2085,"I like it a lot, Baby Bjorn was my pick, but the price on this carrier is so much more appealing. Also it is NOT as bulky as Baby Bjorn. Very light weight, simple to use, super soft too. Overall very pleased.",5
2086,"Would not waste money on this brand again. Does not provide adequate support to your back and shoulders like other brands.",3
2087,"Very good price for this product my son loves the toys on it and the color he stays very busy.",5
2088,"These are very cute little blankets. The 20x20 is just right size but they a really thin. The quality is similar to the target brand Aden. Not the thicker Aden and anais blankets. I'm not sure how well these will hold up over the next few years but for the price, these are good.",4
2089,"I may have to restrain how long a review I actually write about a baby security blanket but I love, love, love these blankets!!We got them and started using them when my daughter (now 18 months) was about 4 months old. We would give them to her for short periods of time then (and I was never worried because they are so thin she can breathe right through them). It took a while for her to really love and want them, but I'm glad we kept offering it because now it's her &#34;go to&#34; lovey object all the time.  We actually have 4 blankets total and they are in constant rotation. And for constantly being used, dragged, washed and loved they have held up amazingly well (surprisingly so! I was prepared to keep buying a new set of two every 3-6 months, but we haven't bought any others since we got these).It's the perfect size blanket too and so, so soft. And, ultimately, the biggest pluses in my mind is that this blanket is super portable and washable (which are very important things when kids are involved!).This is also always a part of new baby gifts I give to all my friends!",5
2090,"I purchased these beginning of June, 2014.Likes:  baby immediately loved (had to take away to wash first), soft and breathableDislikes:  I washed with some bibs with velcro snaps and the velcro snagged the satin edges.  That's probably my fault.",5
2091,"The bag is so small, does not hold more than 5 regular size cloth wipes. I would not recommend it.",3
2092,"I got this as a wipes pouch for cloth diaper wipes.  It's not really good for that since the zipper wicks moisture to the other things in my diaper bag when it's full of wet wipes.  Now I use it as purse storage for my cloth pads.  Works great for that.",4
2093,"If I could have figured out a way to keep these centered on my nipples all day, I would have never taken them off. Didn't tug or stick, no funky smells, no stickiness to clean off after taking them off. Nothing bad to say about them. Great product.",5
2094,"If you have a strong kid who can pull these out like I do... then they fail. But the fact that extra strenght is needed to open the drawers helps keep the baby away",4
2095,"I have purchased it for my 2 year old, about a year and a half ago and it is still serving us wonderfully. My son is tall and skinny so almost every pair of pants is too loose for him in the waist. This stays well on the pants and got washed few times already (accidentally) without any signs of wear. Highly recommend instead of a regular belt, which can be challenging for little ones to open and make it on time to the bathroom.",5
2096,"These completely cover the entire toilet and makes me more comfortable about taking my child to public bathrooms.  They have a thin layer of plastic on one side so nothing is going to come through.  I am in the middle of potty training and these do come out to be a bit expensive for each one so when she doesn't go it makes me sad to throw it away for the price.  However, I love the coverage so I will continue to buy.  Wish this was not an add-on item for Prime and you could just order when needed.",5
2097,"Unlike other disposable toilet seat covers, these will protect your child's underwear and clothing when they go to the bathroom with the flat that goes from the front of the seat to the floor. Great idea and product!",5
2098,"Easier to get into a 14-month-old mouth with her own hand.The flatness is so good because she doesn't really know which side is up, anyway.  The perforations are for the same reason.This can't be your only spoon in the house, but it's good for purees.",5
2099,"Great stroller. Doesn't work with graco snug ride 30. Make sure your car seat has slits in the bottom, otherwise it's not secure. I'm still keeping it because I will need it until the kid can sit-up on their own which is a few months of car seat use.",3
2100,"I purchased several green things from Amazon that all matched in the pictures.  Turns out, this is NOT the color in the picture.  It's more of a muted brown green.  (Think baby poo coloring.)  Aside from the color not matching the photo, the product itself seems great.  It's a thicker fabric with a waterproof interior.  I haven't washed it yet, but it seems like it will hold up well.",3
2101,"These bumpers serve their purpose. Can be a pain at time to keep in place as they tend to slip and slide everywhere but overall good purchase.",3
2102,"Pros: large, lots of pockets, lightweightCons: the material is cheap and frays quickly, the pockets gape and sag awkwardly when u put things aside, he bag is extremely floppy and doesn't hold it's shape.Overall: you could probably find a bag of similar quality at family dollar for under $5",1
2103,"Amazing difference in the time and effort my baby spent trying to down a bottle. I was needing to upgrade levels of nipples and had been forgetting. This add on Amazon price is amazing also. Order a bunch of these to stock up if you're in need!",5
2104,"My daughter is 10 months old and uses the Level 3 standard nipple.  Flow on this nipple is just right for her when she drinks her milk or her water.  I sterilize her nipples by boiling them in hot water for 20 minutes everyday.  So far nipples haven't fallen apart.",5
2105,"I started using these at about 6 months, only when I stopped nursing.  She loves these bottles and would never take any other kind of bottle from me.  I tried to give her other bottles and baby screamed bloody murder.",5
2106,"Very good for the price. I could adapted easily to my bottles. Good choice to keep continue using the bottles that I already have.",5
2107,"These are a great next step for babies once they hit 3-4 months old.  The regular nipples are good for newborns but are so slooooow for our daughter to drink out of now.  That's ok in the evening when she's calm and falling asleep but the rest of the day she is so active and happy she gets distracted and stops drinking when her bottle has a regular nipple.  The Turbo Nozzles (as we call them, lol) let her drink faster and get more in her belly so she's actually getting full before she's distracted!",5
2108,"It took 1451 sucks to level up from level 1 to level 3.It is more rewarding compared to diablo 3.",5
2109,"We like the fact that Dr. brown nipples are not that expensive to replace. Also they do not wear out that quickly and retain their soft shape. Our lil guy was on level 1 for the longest time then went through level 2 & 3 fairly quickly then ended up at level 4 by the time he was 15mo. Y cut we bought but hardly used; maybe more useful if you make your baby's bottle thicker with rice cereal or alike.  We never really followed the recommended age range on the nipple. We assess the need to go up a level based on the readiness signs of our child.",5
2110,"I was so scared my son would fall and hit his head on our wood floor I bought this for him. It worked great because when he did fall he wouldn't be afraid to get back up, and I wouldn't have a heart attack. I will be using this with our next baby as well. The only down side is this thing is thick so their heads do sweat a lot in em, and they will look like the little mushroom guy on super Mario brothers LOL",4
2111,"Bought this hoping it would be easy. The wife was fussy cause it takes so long to set up. And wow the time to make it all nice and solid was almost a full days work.",3
2112,"My other cloths are just as absorbent, even the cotton ones- like Osocosy brand (size2). I have to use this as an insert because at 18lbs my 9mo' old doesn't fit into this w/a large snappy.It works, and it's not disappointing.. but the price I paid for this makes me kind of nauseous when I could have gotten four for the same price from hempbabies or osocosy.",2
2113,"This is one of the only toys my daughter will play with. She has tons of other toys but this is the only one she really took too",5
2114,"seriously. you don't need any other one. except for probably captain calamari, which is the other bright starts toy. these two toys and you are golden. some of the other car toys don't have as interesting enough appendages but these keep the kiddos entertained for a car ride. bought some new ones by some other brand to shake things up but my little one is not impressed.",5
2115,"This has been a big hit for our grandson. He is snug in the jumper, he loves to look at all the colors and hanging items. Easy to move from room to room if necessary, and lightweight. Very happy with this choice.",5
2116,"Very cute little toy. Well worth the price for all that it does. Our 6week old loves when his big brothers play with this with him.",5
2117,"The baby loves this darling little panda. Educational and entertaining. My daughter said she wants to chew his ears. She adores anything that plays music. It puts her asleep.",5
2118,"This one stays put - the rounded end is perfect and we call it &#34;the plug&#34; because its the only pacifier that stays put in my son's mouth. Worth the $$ for sure!",5
2119,"Worked great and protected my baby from sharp edges.",5
2120,"I never felt like baby was really secure in this wrap. I watched all the tutorials and did everything right but I couldn't not have a hand on her or she'd feel really unstable. She also hated the way it held her body, I think it was much more uncomfortable than a Moby or Ergo carrier. It also pulled awkwardly on my one shoulder and was not comfortable at all.",1
2121,"One of those baby items I've gotten the most use out of. This is amazing. I used it mainly for dry snacks and id never leave home without it. It's really a great product and I recommend it to all moms. I only stopped using it because my son eats so much now that it doesn't fit enough servings in it.",5
2122,"This is my little guys absolute favorite teether. He has tons of teething toys but this is one that he never loses interest in.",5
2123,"Great to clean those cloth diapers. Only brand I used. Only had to used it for a 1 yr and 10 months. I will use again when I do cloth diapers on next child.",5
2124,"you only use a small amount and it works great in getting diapers clean. good for stripping diapers but expensive for laundry detergent.",4
2125,"My son loves these.  He had been struggling with regular sippy cups but has no problem adjusting to these.  The only struggle we have is when the level gets low, he still likes to lift it like drinking from a regular cup- our solution to this though is just to remove the straw and it still works great!  They truly are no-spill with the exception of a small drop that may get caught in the top of the straw and flies out as my son shakes the cup around- but a drop is much better than a leak!  The only negative is that by choosing the &#34;Colors May Vary&#34; option we got a pink cup and a purple cup- but it was a cheaper price and doesn't really bother us, but in light of an honest review, I thought I would mention it for people who may care.",5
2126,"My son prefers these cups to sippy cups. They are not spill proof. If you use these for milk the straws are hard to clean.",4
2127,"Would not waste my money next time. It ripped very easily. There are other brands with better quality. Did not like this one.",2
2128,"These things are used constantly, I purchased a second set so I could leave one attached to my sons carseat.  They have both hard and soft features so he can chomp on it all day long.  The ring makes it nice to attach it to things and for little hands to hold.  Easy to clean, easy to chill, overall an excellent baby toy!!",5
2129,"Enough said. She's one, chewing and biting everything in sight, including me and my shirt, so I's say it's a go with these. Frozen they are numbing and comforting for sore mouths and gums.",5
2130,"I like the ring sling, but the color isn't what it appears on the screen.  It looks faded and denim-like so I returned for the Isle of Skye (purple), which is so pretty!",2
2131,"I got a free 2pack directly from dream baby. Like other said kinda pain to install but after the first,  its cake. They work as expected on my cabinet doors. Idk how these would work on drawers...but never needed to childproof my drawers.",4
2132,"I bought these and while I guess they are what they are advertised to be, they seem to get &#34;in the way&#34; when closing the drawer and therefore get bent and then the drawer won't close at all.  Not exactly what I needed for my kitchen drawers.",3
2133,"I love that this brush is budget friendly but holds up well. I normally toss my brushes well before they need to be trashed for fear of bacteria over growth and at this price I don't worry about bringing out a new brush so soon.",4
2134,"I love these sippy cups! They are durable enough to be used time and time again, but inexpensive enough that if they are lost, I won't cry over it. I especially love the spout cover!",5
2135,"I love my stroller even more since buying this seat. I have a 30 lb 3 year old and an infant.Pros:-I like that my b-ready stroller is a single stroller when I need it to be (just click in the car seat and go) and a double when I have both of them with me.-My 3 year old doesn't like riding in strollers anymore, but thinks it's really cool to ride so low in this one.-you can attach this one handed-it actually reclines pretty far back and is easy to doCons:-bit of an awkward fit in the trunk of my 2013 Altima, but I make it work. I put the stroller in first, then put this seat over it in a specific position.-basket becomes part of her seat when in use, but I still cram my enormous coach diaper bag in the front of the basket and can still access it from the front zipper. My daughter does have to put her feet on the bag though. There's not much room for extra shopping bags.-definitely takes two hands to remove it. I have to bend all the way down and press a button in on each side to lift it up. This wasn't an option for me until about 2 months after my c-section.Everywhere we go other moms are oohing and ahhing over it. No kidding, I am always stopped and asked about it. I also have the bassinet to go with it. I like that too, but this is way more useful.",4
2136,"As a first time mother, this was essential for nursing my infant. I received this and the boppy, this is a far superior product to the boppy for nursing your infant. It provides the right amount of support and holds baby in position much better. The only thing the boppy is good for in my opinion is propping your newborn up. Stick with this for feedings.",5
2137,"This review is from my wife since I obviously cannot use this product. This really helps with breastfeeding a newborn.  It helps position baby comfortably and effectively. All of the popular or recommended feeding positions can be achieved with this.",5
2138,"I got this as a gift and never used it (minus one time). This is something that is not needed. I had it in my baby registry since I read such good reviews here. My bad! I sold it on craigslist right after the first time I used it. Please don't waste your money here, go buy something useful for yourself or your baby. Good luck with nursing!PS: I didnt have the fireworks, I had one with polka dots cover.",1
2139,"My son is now 14 months and he still sleeps on it while cuddled to me ! Love it !",5
2140,"We live in a watershed area that is full of mosquitos and this is a lifesaver since walks would be pretty itchy without it!  Fits the stroller well.",5
2141,"This product works as stated between my Britax B-ready stroller and Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat. There is a strap that you put through the seat belt track on the car seat for added security. When using with the B-ready, you don't need the Britax infant car seat receivers.Note that if you want to use this adapter for the lower level of the B-ready -- you also need the Britax B-Ready Lower Infant Car Seat Adapter.",5
2142,"great first toothbrush for baby. Our daughter enjoyed this from the time she was 6 months until about 12 months. Then we switched to an actual toothbrush.",5
2143,"Soft tiny bristles & the guard make it a good combination when toddler is learning to brush.  Easy to clean and my toddler isn't scared of it.",4
2144,"This is a great first toothbrush for infants and toddlers.  The silicone bristles are soft enough to use on gums and sturdy enough to clean teeth.  The flange keeps the brush from gagging my daughter, but has the added benefit of keeping the brush from touching the surface you set it down on.  And my toddler likes to bite this brush as I am cleaning her teeth, but it is still intact and working well.",5
2145,"While not a necessity for BF'ing I do find this stool very useful when nursing on the couch in our living room.  Our rocker also didn't come with an ottoman so I've used it in the nursery as well.  The grip strips seemed a bit rough at first but have worn down nicely.",5
2146,"I was miserable with my pump until buying these, thank goodness someone has pretty much thought of everything when it comes to pumping! :)",5
2147,"Very flimsy, they come apart easily after only one use. Would not buy again and would not recommend. They do work, just not well, and as I said, they fall apart.",2
2148,"i would.my baby is 13 months old and i am still using this to get him to sleep. this is a golden baby product. worth every single penny. if it was a million dollars and i had a million dollars, i would buy it. i have a bad back and i'm secretly gloating inside while my annoying co-worker complains of back problems with her baby.",5
2149,"We bought this for my toddler for school.  He LOVES the monkey.  They quality is pretty good, but for the price I paid I think it's fair.  It did pill once it was washed and the Velcro isn't as strong as I would like, but overall it was the price point I wanted.  I do plan to buy a 2nd one.",4
2150,"gets very weird after a little bit of use. but the design and the thought behind is great. machine wash does nothing",2
2151,"We use this so our baby will have something a little softer than hardwood floors to fall on. So far she's hit her head a few times while falling on it and it hasn't seemed to phase her. It's not as soft as carpet but it does have some slight give to make a tumble not hurt as much.",5
2152,"The color is very bright and colorful and beautiful. And there is no smell. But it's hard for baby to crawl on it. It's a little slippery.",4
2153,"the one and only thing that bugs me about these is just getting the holes lined up just right so you can see the oz notches.",5
2154,"This brush simply doesn't work. I put soap in the handle like I was told at the store, but nothing came out.",1
2155,"I loved this!  I used this in the baby stroller so I didn't have to take out the heavy infant seat out of the car.  He fit nicely in the stroller with these.  I have 2 - one for the regular stroller and one for the jogging stroller so I didn't have to move them back and forth.  I showed this to my son's Physical Therapist (he has tortocollis) and she loved the idea.  She told me that this works better than a rolled up towel or blanket because it goes all the way down and supports their whole body.Highly recommend!!!",5
2156,"This is the Ameda 4 pack and is what the wife was using already. It is a quality product and I would suggest it to others.",4
2157,"If you're actually just using these for storage, the two-piece lids (which allow for using a nipple directly) are annoying to deal with, but they do not leak and the bottles are a perfect size for a single feeding.  If you want to feed your baby with these bottles (not designed to mimic breastfeeding nor to prevent colic/gas) by just adding a nipple, then they're for you!",4
2158,"Since I can't find these parts at any local stores, it's worth having a couple on hand as spares in case I rip or lose one. My pump also seemed to work better when I replaced these little valves after a few months. True Ameda product.",5
2159,"First off, I find it extremely concerning that the success of my pumping efforts and ability to feed my infant while at work teeters uncertainly on the point of a pair of tiny, fragile, and insanely expensive plastic valves.  Like many, my Ameda pump was insurance-issued and I had no choice of pump.  With a brand new set of valves, my pump performs great.  I baby my valves, removing them with a.spoon per my Ameda customer service representative's instructions, carefully washing, and air drying them on a towel. Despite my efforts, these spendy little nuggets go downhill fast. I swear, all you need to do is look at them wrong and they instantly develop microscopic tears.  Within a week, my pump suction begins to suffer, as does my husband as he deals with my pump-induced frustration and mounting rage. Yes, it was great to get a free pump, but being locked into the constant valve replacement is not-so-great.  But, here we are!  To those who mentioned in their reviews that these are a good deal: really??",3
2160,"I get these for free from my insurance company so I don't purchase them on amazon but thought I would do a review to help out. Look, ALL breast milk storage bags leak or have some annoying quality about them. We can send a man to the moon but we can't figure out how to store breast milk. Amazing, don't you think? But here is the deal with these bags. I have been using them for four months and, for me, they do not leak at any of the seams, only at the top seal. A couple of times I am certain it was because I didn't check the seal well enough before freezing. But I would argue they shouldn't be that hard to slide lock. Most times I am sure there was something wrong with the seal... Because when I double check each time and squeeze the bag a little, I can hear air coming out of the top quite often. So I started putting them upright in a Tupperware container propped up against the frozen peas so they would freeze upright and, even if the seal was defective, I didn't lose milk. So for thawing, I never drop in water and let soak. I stand with a large bowl in the sink filled with water and dangle the bags into the water, never letting the water go over the seal. Laborious? Yup. But I have read ALL the other brands' comments and leaking seems to be a common thread.Now, the pour spout is something unique to ameda and I actually like it a lot. I know some reviewers don't for their own reasons, but I do like to cut the spout with a scissors and pour easily into a bottle. I have spilled a little a couple of times, sure, but no one is perfect.Do I recommend these bags? I do. Just be aware there will be some flaws in the product. I have also tried Lansinoh from a free sample and while I like the thickness of the bag, I can't figure out how to pour the milk out easily. The other breast milk bags are a strange design... As if the people who designed them don't actually know the bags are for more than just storing... They are should be for pouring as well.Best of luck.",3
2161,"I was excited for this, and it will definitely get the job done, but I like my plain old babies r us brand one better.",3
2162,"Fits over Chicco KeyFit 30 nicely, even over the car seats sun shade. Keeps bugs and sun out but allows air flow through side vents. Also keeps neighbor's hands off baby when walking.",5
2163,"I use this EVERY DAY on our walks and to the park, etc. its easy to use and covers the entire carrier. Its UV protective and protects our newborn from bugs but great ventilation material and you can still see your baby. Has an option for cover to shade completely. It could protect from light rain drizzle but its not water proof. Its also easy to spot clean and dries quickly. We LOVE this item its a must-have for all new moms with infants!",5
2164,"We love these. There was a little bit of a smell when we opened them but we let them sit in the garage for a day or two and it was gone. They pad our hardwoods just enough for them when they tumble. We did just move them, and the floors were slippery where the pads had been, but it lasted for a few days and now they seem fine.My 10 month olds do try to chew on the edges now that they are showing (previously we had the playpen set up so that they didn't have access to any of the edges). It's something to watch out for, one of my twins did get a little piece off.",4
2165,"Love this gate.  Not the most beautiful part of our home but not too ugly and is very secure/strong.  Clicks into place well and keeps our baby safe as he tries to get to the stairs.  If you are okay with a boring brown color this is a great gate!!!",5
2166,"Can't wait to use on my newborn. Just by touch and feel you can tell it is well made and with top quality materials.",5
2167,"Good quality will buy again. A little on the small size so buy a bigger size.",4
2168,"I needed a additional pad that worked with the nursery color, so I got this one, it is nice but it looses a bit of its softness after you wash it. Mind you baby doesn't stay on it for long so it is not exactly a problem but I wanted to let you know.",3
2169,"A friend recommended these over Best Bottom, and I have started using Blueberries for nighttime and Best Bottom covers during the day.  I like Best bottom because they have two layers and are more trim, but Blueberries are nice because you can put a lot more &#34;stuffing&#34; in them and they are much roomier.  I do think they'll work for older babies for that reason (right now my baby is 11 months).  I don't love them during the day because they are roomier so I can't just put a prefold in there and expect it to stay (I don't like snappis), but this isn't an issue with Best Bottom because the cover is better at holding them in place.My friend found that these lost their waterproofing after a few months - she thinks it's because she put them in the dryer.  We've air dried ours and have not had this problem, though I would love it if they were thicker (they're just one layer).  The binding doesn't leak like Thirsties though, so I'm grateful for that.I would definitely buy these again, but I wish Best Bottom made a roomier cover since I think those covers are superior.",4
2170,"Aside from the pattern being sooooooo cute, I love the double gausset on the legs. Definitely not for newborns (but it's indicated on the size). Have had several explosive BM poops but no leaks.",5
2171,"My son loves it when I bought for him when he was only 12 weeks. I used it when he was in the car seat.

2173,"I'm surprised that this is not one of the must haves on all parents' list.  I bought it for my son when he was born.  He loved it. I loved it.  So I bought it for my niece when she was born.  She loved it.  My brother loved it.  Got them for all my friends who were having babies.  They all love it.  Everytime I saw them with the infant seat, this mobile was alway attached.  It has clip and velcro so it can be attached to handle of infact car seat, stroller shades, and with improvement, now it comes with crib attachment which wasn't avaiable back when my son was born.  It has options to play song and rotate mobile or just rotate mobile.  It's batter operated so no need to wind or pull strings every couple second.",5
2174,"The music we generally kept off. It sounds like those old push button electronic keyboard toys. I like all the different ways of attachment, and I'm actually using the attachment arm to hold another toy she is way more fond of to the bassinet! It does what it says and the animals are bright colored. To me though they rotate backward (in a butt-first pattern). That's minor, but I thought it was odd.",3

This is perfect and does the job and at a reasonable price. No need for a fancy-shmancy mobile - your baby will out grow it before you know it. This one is perfect!",5
2177,"We use this on our pack and play, rock and play and crib. You can use it on your stroller but not in the car bc that wouldn't be safe. But its very cute and it entertains my daughter for quite a while! Great price too!!!",5
2178,"I thought I was gonna love this but it's just ok. I think it's a bit loud. I had to put tape over the speaker because it was SO loud. The tape muffled the noise. I like how I can easily release it and move it if I need to. It's simple which is good. If my daughter loved it then I'd probably give it another star but she's indifferent about it.",3
2179,"It's really a good bag. I like the fact that it's a backpack, and it actually fits quite an amount of things inside. Great for those &#34;one handed&#34; moments when diaper changing, and washes very easy.",5

2184,"It is a great concept but the design still needs some help. We have it hanging on a wall to save some space, but the pockets can't take much weight without them leaning at an angle and bowing inwards (especially the side pockets). They need something to rigidize the shelving and back of the soft goods area.",2
2185,"We don't even use it.  It has GREAT compartments, but with the way it needs to hang on the cribs:BE SURE YOU HAVE SIDE RAILS OR FRONT RAILS THAT ARE NOT TOO THIN OR CURVED AS THIS DESIGN REQUIRES TO HANG STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AND WILL SLIDE IF NOT LEVEL!!Hanging it on the wall is not an option, who wants this on their wall??!?!?!?!Be cautious on this design, it works great if your crib can accomodate it, but even still, it is bulky and not meant for the front of the crib.",2
2186,"Plenty of bottles. Seems like original marked medela bottles. Quality of bottles seem good. Packed in a bag and adhesive from the sealed bag is not stuck on many of my bottles and going to be hard to remove without goo gone.",3
2187,"When my newborn came home from the hospital it took awhile before we figured out which type of nipples and bottles she preferred.  After lots of trial and error we ended up just purchasing more of the small type of formula bottles they use in the hospital along with these nipples to go on top.  These were my daughter's favorites for about 3 months.  I do wish they were better designed for reuse though.  The packaging states one time use if you happen to try to sterilize them and reuse them they don't hold up too well.",4
2188,"I bought these for the ready to eat Similac formula 2oz bottles that I had when my baby was just born. I mean they work great, but I thought the flow was a little fast and my daughter never relaxed during her feedings. So that's when I bought Dr. Brown's bottles and never looked back. Of course these are a little bit wasteful because they are supposed to be for one feeding, but I cleaned mine and used them a few more times. I did put them in my recycle bin when I was done.",4
2189,"I love these cloth diapers. They are easy to put on my son and I love that they grow with him. I had to wait until my little peanut was a little older before he fit into them, but now that he does, I love them! Word to the wise, be sure to follow the laundering directions!! You can't just use any old detergent. You have to use specific safe for bumGenius soaps. I didn't follow the rules and they stunk really bad until I figured out what I needed to do. I use Nellie's Laundry soap and it is lasting me forever and his diapers come out clean. I kept adding oxyclean to get the smell out and that is the LAST thing you should do! Don't add anything! Just bleach once in a while. Even though these diapers are a little expensive at first, they will last until you potty train your child and then on to the next baby. My friend has used hers for 4 boys. Love the velcro closures too. They make squirmy diapering much easier!",5
2190,"Gates are good and hold up to our destructive daughter's tendencies. She did figure out how to open it in about a week, but there is the locking latch that keeps her at bay.These were one of the sets of baby gates that were wide enough to fit my doorways. They work fairly well. I have experienced bowing at the gates while looking downward over the top toward the  bottom (vertically). Gate still holds up. I don't feel like I've wasted my money, which is a good thing now-a-days.",3
2191,"This gate swings both ways (90 degrees) and has a sliding mechanism to fit smaller or larger widths.It attaches to two walls - with or without baseboards, or one wall and one banister. You'll have leftover hardware, because it gives you every option.It is NOT screwless. One side of this gate MUST be screwed in.The instructions are poor - dark photographs and sentences that don't explain themselves well.However, once in place, the velcro (which sounds flimsy) is incredible well designed and uber strong around the banister part of your stairs. The individual pieces seem cheap, but once constructed there's no way my kids is getting through this gate.",5
2192,"Due to this major lack in functionality, this baby gate cannot fulfill its purpose of allowing a parent with a child in arms to enter and exit through it. You'd have to use both hands to operate this. On top of this some of the parts in the box were broken (not the ones used for the installation for our purposes, but if someone wanted to install it in a different spot, they wouldn't be able to). We returned this item.Normally I would give this one star, because we really did hate it, but I give it two because if you used it solely to close off an area it would work pretty well. You wouldn't be able to use it as an opening gate (while carrying a baby), but if you had both hands free, this could work ok.",2
2193,"If you can get it to stay in the wall!! The screws weren't long enough for the anchors provided so after about 3 days at the top of the stairs, the whole gate fell out of the wall. Good thing my 1 year old son wasn't anywhere near it when it happened!! The gate was great before if fell off of the wall, which was why it got 2 stars. Now we need to go find better screws/anchors. Too bad the right equipment wasn't supplied with the product. :(",2

2196,"We liked this machine but just after 1 year's worth of use, it quit working. No warning, just stopped. For a product by a company called First Years...don't expect this to last more than one year.I wrote First Years and they actually said they won't give me a coupon, replacement or anything but that I can sign up on their email list to buy other products of theirs. Poor response.",3
2197,"These are affordable, compared to the 100% cotton and bamboo ones that I had, so I thought I would try them out. They are terrible. Water just rolls off of them, and they don't clean very well. They also seem rough compared to the natural fiber ones. They don't do much when dry, and when you wet them, the water beads up on them and makes a mess. Don't bother.",2
2198,"I don't reach for these right away when my cloth diaper/wipe stash is clean. They get folded on the bottom and only get grabbed if I'm out of my thirsties fab wipes. They're a bit too soft and flimsy (not too bad, but just enough) to stay in my hand as well as thirsties wipes do. I need a wipe that's not going to slide around too much. I don't need my hands going in poop as I wipe! hahaI guess I wish I'd just got another pack of thirsties wipes instead. In fact I still might and these will then probably never be used as I'll keep pushing them to the bottom of the wipes pile. hahaOh, but if I *only* had these then I probably would be okay with them. I'm sure if it was all I knew they'd be just fine. But I do have thirsties so I know better ;)",3
2199,"I ordered these and after using them ordered more because they are the best we found. We also tried some flannel wipes and some terry wipes and these are the softest, largest, and best quality. I am not worried about these deteriorating after years of use. They are easy to wash and clean the bottom easily. Great money saver and safe choice wipe!",5
2200,"Love these wipes! After a few weeks I bought a few more packages. They are nice and thick and very soft. The other wipes I have get scratchy when I hang them outside to dry but these do not. Our baby also never complains when being wiped with these and tends to be more irritated with we use either the baby face cloths or the flannel wipes. Definitely worth the extra money.",5
2201,"We use these as baby washcloths, not wipes. They are very soft on baby's delicate skin, especially the face. They wash and dry well.",5
2202,"These wipes are ultra soft on baby's delicate skin. I carry these wipes with me everywhere I go to clean up baby drool and spit up, but I also use them to bathe baby and to prevent getting peed on during diaper changes. It's nice that so many come in one pack since I do use them in a variety of ways.",5
2203,"I returned these because the arms were unusually long and even when rolled up, they would unrole and frustrate me like crazy.",3

2206,"Compared to other name brand utensils, these were a bit heavy but my son got the hang after a few months. At first he just liked playing with Elmo. He is about 2.5 and it works well for meals.",4
2207,"We under estimated how large this bassinet really is.  It's definately worth it for long walks and you want the baby to sleep flat.  It provides good coverage against sun and wind.",5
2208,"I bought two of these mattresses. One for my 2 year old and the other for my (at the time) 4 month old. My two year old had a cheaper mattress (safety first or first years or something) that did last, but started to sag in the middle. My infant was transitioning out of the bassinet.There is a side for infants (extra firm) and a side for older kids (firm). The mattress seems very comfortable and both of my kids sleep like rocks on it. My 2 year old had no issue going from one mattress to the other, though she was surprised by the thickness and firmness, since her other mattress was kind of saggy and loose feeling, but she immediately loved it.They make these mattresses in twin and full size as well. I'll most likely order them for my girls when they outgrow these mattresses. They are pricy, but worth it. I wish I hadn't wasted $55 on the other mattress for my toddler and just bought this one from the start.",5
2209,"I'm in 7 months with this mattress. I THINK the mattress is starting to cave in a little in the center since baby sleeps there every night. Otherwise I haven't had any issues at all. Baby loves it!",4
2210,"The stroller is pretty awesome! We use it wherever we go. It holds a lot in the underneath pouch even though the picture makes it look small. And it's really easy to fold up and heave into the car. The steering is awesome! I can turn easily without having to back up or anything. The things that I would complain about on this is that there is no divider for the legs on the stroller. Typically there's a plastic thing that sits there, but there's only the seat belt. If I don't have the seat belt on my daughter, she would just slide right out (and she has). The car seat kind of seemed cheap compared to the car seats we already had and when put in the stroller, it would rock around and only attached at the top of the car seat and not at the feet. So the car seat was flopping around as we were walking (so not safe at all!)",4
2211,"Since I am  the Grandma I am not present during the night  shift, but my daughter seems pleased with the results.  Fits great and is very soft and comfortable.  The colors are great as well. Would recommend it for teething pain.",5
2212,"I did a lot of research on baby monitors before my LO was born.  I was looking for a sound monitor that had a very good distance range as I want to be able to go outside and work in my flower gardens and still know if my baby is awake and crying.  This monitor is listed at 1000 feet.  So I bought it.  BUT after plugging it in and trying it for the first time last weekend...I can tell you that the 1000 feet distance is an out and out LIE!!!!  It barely covers my single floor 2500 sq ft home.  And when I walked right out my front door...it started beeping telling me it was out of range.  Stupid!  I counted my steps from baby monitor unit to my front door and it was only about 35 steps.  I then tested it going out onto my back porch...and I got 2 feet into my back yard and again the out of range beeping started.  This unit has some nice features (lullaby's, temp, humidity, etc.) but the Range sucks!  And since that was the main reason I purchased it...I am sending it back ASAP.",2
2213,"Only complaint is that it sometimes looses connection and beeps for a while and I end up waving the thing in the air for it to reconnect.",5
2214,"I have a sweet little 4 month old baby that likes to be close to mommy at all times. This has been challenging for me. I have just got used to holding him all day and carrying him around, but my back was starting to really suffer. I honestly didn&#8217;t know anything about carriers. We had a Chicco front pack (crotch dangler as I&#8217;ve learned since doing research), but that hurt my back worse, so I only used it a couple times. Plus, he looked super uncomfortable in it. A friend mentioned they were getting the Ergo and I thought maybe I should look into what made that so special. My eyes were opened to the baby carrying possibilities. I started doing some research and found this Beco Gemini and am absolutely in love with it and it has changed my life. I&#8217;m going to elaborate a little on what I&#8217;ve noticed over the last month with it.The positives:-Comfort: My first priority in finding a carrier was the comfort of my back. My pregnancy and my job (ER nurse) have really messed with my back, so I wanted a carrier that would give me the benefits of having my baby close without the pain. The Gemini has been WONDERFUL in this regard. It feels incredibly comfortable carrying him. I have walked a mile with him in it and felt no strain. I also have soccer practice for my older child 1  hours three days a week. I put him in the Gemini and everything is great. He&#8217;s happy and momma is happy.-Front facing: I&#8217;m soooo glad I got a carrier that also does front facing. The Ergo does not. My son does not like to be facing in. I try to always start him facing in to get him more used to it, but he usually only lasts 5 minutes before he&#8217;s fussing and wants to be turned around. I look forward to trying the hip carry and backpack carry in the future!-Ease of use: This carrier really only takes about a minute to put on and get the baby adjusted in. I&#8217;m so happy when I go to the store now I can carry him rather than leave him in his car seat. He seems so much happier.-Buckles: Like I said, I did extensive research when buying and I kept reading over and over about the annoying buckles. I&#8217;m putting them as a negative, but they really aren&#8217;t that bad. Now that I&#8217;ve got used to them they aren&#8217;t annoying at all. Reviewers say it&#8217;s hard to use both hands because they have to hold baby, but I don&#8217;t find it a problem. So, if I&#8217;m unbuckling the right side. I take my right hand and hold down the button. I wrap my left arm around the front, supporting my son, and push the buckles in. My son is never left unsupported. I can do this quickly and easily. I don&#8217;t see why the waist buckle needs to be the safety buckles, but the side ones are right at finger level. My 4 month old obviously couldn&#8217;t unbuckle anything, but if you intend to use this up to 35 lbs, a bigger kid riding backpack style might be able to. I think it&#8217;s a good safety feature.The negatives:-Height: When I put it on with my son facing forward the carrier comes right below his nose. This doesn&#8217;t seem to bother him, but he spends the whole time in the carrier gnawing on the fabric. I try to use a pacifier to prevent it, but he isn&#8217;t big on his binky. This is annoying&#8230; BUT when he&#8217;s faced towards me having that come up a little further helps offer a little more head support.-Straps: When he&#8217;s facing me the side straps are right in his face. This is another tempting chew toy for him. But additionally, I think this is part of the reason he likes to be turned out to the front. He seems very annoyed with the side straps.-No storage: This isn&#8217;t a feature I would expect on carriers, but when I read the some other carriers have a storage pocket I was jealous. Although it would be tempting to put my phone in the pocket and I am a little paranoid about the radiation from cell phones being too close to baby and for extended periods of time, so maybe it&#8217;s better for me that there&#8217;s no pocket.Overall, I am extremely thankful I bought this carrier. I wish I would&#8217;ve known about these when my son was first born. It would&#8217;ve saved me some aches and pains. It also can be used newborn and up without any extra purchases (the Ergo needs a special newborn piece), but I only got it when he was 3 months old so I didn&#8217;t need anything. I am a very excited, proud babywearning mommy now. I recommend this carrier to anyone looking, but I would encourage you to do your research and find the carrier that best suites you. Maybe a storage pocket is more important than having a carrier that faces baby out to you. I don&#8217;t know. But either way compare some. If you have a friend with a carrier, go try theirs to see what you think. It&#8217;s a significant purchase and you want to be happy with it.",4
2215,"I bought this when my son was only a few weeks old (he is now 11 months) and we've used this countless times! It was a lifesaver when he was little and fussy.  Easy to put on, adjust, and take off.  I practiced in the house quite a few times to get the hang of it before using it out and about (it does take some practice getting baby in correctly).  The only two cons I have found are that 1) it is really hot in the summer (we actually switched to a ring sling for summer) but I will continue to use this in the fall again and 2) I am petite and the straps seem huge over my shoulders/shoulder blades. Not so huge that it affects the use/safety of the carrier, but more of an appearance issue.  I still love this carrier, even those these are two downsides for me.  I would recommend this carrier!",5
2216,"I haven't used this carrier much but I liked it the times I have used it. I like that it has the parts to snap back so that when baby is forward facing their hips aren't too spread apart. I feel like the crossing over in the back is more supportive and easier on my back. My baby is really heavy and I have a weak back but I can carry him for about an hour in this carrier",4
2217,"So I looked at a number of baby carriers but decided to go with this one after trying on a couple at our local baby store. Honestly, the first three months of our baby's life he was so happy in the Boba wrap but as soon as he hit three months, he became more interested in seeing the world. and wanted to have a little more flexibility. We has always been big for height and weight, and we still only faced him in towards us for the majority of the time, and since that time this has been our go-to choice for carriers.Fast forward 5 months and now he is 8 months old and we have tried the carrier in every position. He is still as happy as a clam. We recently returned from a month living in Amsterdam with side trip all around the lowland countries. The carrier was where our little man was the most happy. We wore him facing in when we walked from place to place or climbed bell towers; we faced him out when we were at the museums so he could see the art/ exhibits; we wore him as a backpack when we biked from Amsterdam north to Marken and back. Our little guy loves to take naps in this carrier. He is comfortable when I wear him (5'6&#34; 150lbs) and when my hubby wears him (6'4&#34; 230lbs).Things I love about this carrier:-Machine washable. It cleans up very easily.-4 carrying positions including Ergonomic-inwards and Experiencing-the-world-outwards-Quick on/off even with the fussy buckle-So comfortable for you and the baby-Simple and completely adjustableOnly thing I don't love:The buckle is annoying, but it's not really an issue. Strapping in isn't the problem, but taking it off is when you need two hands. Most of the time you unlatch the top buckle (across the top of your back), take your baby out and set him down, then spin the waist buckle to the front and pop it off. There are two hacks you can do if it really bothers you. First is find and buy a replacement large buckle. Good luck. I know somewhere you can find one, but I'm still looking. OR you can buckle the waist buckle backwards so the locking mechanism doesn't line up. I've done this a couple times by accident and it hasn't unlatched on me, but it's probably not the safest so I don't recommend it. The pros outweigh the cons on this one.Hope that helps!",5
2218,"I loved this thing: it was comfortable, easy to take on and off, great extra support, and special buttons for the clips to protect them from coming undone too easily, but my baby hated being in it.  As soon as he was strapped in, front-facing or back, he wanted out!  There was nothing wrong with the carrier, though, it was all him.  It's a preference thing, I guess, but I loved it (this is why it only got 4 stars from me, though).",4
2219,"Was too big for my 5 month old.. he is 15lbs but he just was not able to spread his legs to accomodate the width of the carrier. Also the clips are way too time consuming/difficult to open/close quickly or even by oneself... needs assistance.Returned it :( Wanted to like this one badly",1
2220,"I love that this can do all the positions.  I love this for baby and toddlerhood. For newborns I still would opt moby but for a more mobile baby this lets them see more of the world without hurting your back!  The weight distribution really alleviates aches!",5
2221,"I've been wanting to try out waterproof plastic bibs ever since my baby started eating solid food thinking maybe they will save me from  hand washing and scrubbing the bib right after she eats so it won't leave a stain when it dries because with a cloth bib you pretty much can't leave her food to dry there otherwise it will leave a stain.So I tried this and thought they were okay. It is stainless, yes, but then because of the cloth lining of the bib, I still have to wash and scrub that part with my hands each time wet food gets there. Although this is really undoubtedly easier to clean than cloth bib and it dries faster too.  One thing I notice about this, too, is that my baby can easily pull this bib off her. Although she can't do it at once or twice, when she gets somehow frustrated, her force to pull this is enough for her to take this off. The pocket does help quite a bit to keep the food off of her clothes and lap. Although I can't be sure if this will catch crumbs and something like cheerios, though.Overall, I'd say this is a nice average-quality bib for your baby. Nice colors and designs. I'd recommend this for babies that are 6 months or older and more for the purpose of keeping your clean from wet food.",4
2222,"Very happy with these. Bought them to start using while I potty train my daughter. She likes them because they look like big girl panties. I like them because they hold a decent amount of wetness while we are still in the early stages, without adding too much bulk.",5
2223,"These are excellent training pants, that fit and look just like our regular undies.We've only had one accident in these (so far) and they've seemed to corral most of the mess.We only use them when we'll be out of the house for extended mornings with lots of activities or traveling (car/air).  My son seems to be in between two sizes.  The mediums are a little large (there is definitely some extra bulk in his shorts, making this feel more diaper-like).  While the smalls are trimmer, but are just too small for him.  Since we just use for travel, we go with the mediums and it doesn't seem to be a big deal.",5
2224,"I have been cloth diapering consistently since 2012 with my two children and have used, almost exclusively, Fuzzibunz elite.  We ordered our first dozen in 2011 before our first daughter arrived, and since her arrival, have ordered the same diapers every 6-9 months to add to our supply and to replace some that malfunctioned (yes, the snaps do wear and break, and if it happens to enough of the snaps, you really can't use the dipe anymore).  My experience has been that in ordering each subsequent delivery of diapers I got a different product each time.  Some of our Fuzzibunz have a soft fleece interior, others have a rougher fleece that seems to clump a bit more. Some types have elastic you can easily adjust and other you have to turn inside out to adjust the elastic (this is a pain in the butt, btw). And the most-recent delivery, which we ordered off Amazon in August 2013 revealed an almost completely reconfigured product... huge diapers, unfit for a newborn and much thinner elastic without the classic numbering system.  I can't figure out why this precut is so inconsistent.  Even the inserts are different from generation to generation and are made of completely different materials (and I find them to not be that absorbent)Should this deter you from cloth diapering? Probably not.  Cloth isn't that difficult, especially for the first 6 -8 months before you introduce solids (breasted baby poop can go straight into the washer and comes out no problem).  Cloth saves a ton of money on diapers and is definitely much better on your baby's bottom... way. way fewer rashes with the cloth diapers than with disposables, even friendly disposables like Honest Co and 7th Generation. If I were to do it all over again, I'd probably still stick with AOS pocket diapers, but would  look at Bum Genius and other brands because I'm thinking there have to be other products out there which are more consistent with their sizing, manufacture and composition.",3
2225,"It feels like decent quality, built well, but I'm not sure it will continue to hold up to my 8 month old pulling on it. Also, it only works for one center screw face plate, won't work with two screws on the top on bottom. A real shame when trying to cover upgraded outlets and cable connections.Also, it was near impossible for me to get it apart. I had to pry it open with a screw driver.",2
2226,"I will say that this does its job and my baby can't get to the plug to remove it or even tough the thing. However, I had a difficult time with this product in the installation because I had an outlet plug from my powerstrip that was almost too big for it, and I had to really bend it and work with it for several minutes to get it to work.",3
2227,"These are very easy to install and work better at deterring our little one than the safely outlet plugs. We put these on the outlets that are in here crawling path and she does not even stop by them now. The outlet cover does pop out quite a bit so this would not work if you have furniture close to the wall but if you have an exposed outlet, it works very well. The cover is easy to remove when you do need to use it (like when I vacuum). I would recommend this product to households with little ones.",4
2228,"I got 2 of these for our living room where we need to use the outlets for lamps and electronics.  I was pretty disappointed when I installed the first one because the power strip we have plugged into the outlet is the only thing that can be used with this box because the whole at the bottom where the wire goes through is pretty small.  On the other side of the room, I had hoped to use it with an outlet that a window air conditioner is plugged into, but the wire wouldn't fit through the whole in the bottom.We also live in an older house and our outlet covers vary in size, so this cover only works with standard outlets.  It's too small for some of our outlets (there would be a space in the wall that a child could access).If you had regular things to plug into the outlets and standard outlets, I'm sure they'd be perfect, but they didn't really work for our needs.",3
2229,"Swaddle Designs make the best, cutest, and softest crib sheets. They are good quality and fit the crib mattress. I ordered several of their designs. All of the sheets I have ordered are flannel, so keep that in mind if you live in a warm climate. They work well for our weather in the northwest. This one is my favorite!!!!",5
2230,"I am really impressed with the Ozeri Turtlemeter.  The quick instantaneous readings on top of all the other features make this product ideal for bath time.  The three colors on the LED screen offer a quick way to see if there needs to be a temp change.  I love that readings are taken every second so the numbers are constantly accurate.  Plus, he's really cute and the kids enjoy playing with him in the tub too. *I received a sample in exchange for an honest blog review.",5
2231,"Most other moms I spoke with said this wasn't necessary, but boy, has it helped me with bathtime! I'd say the only issue I have with it, is that it takes time for the temperature to climb on the probe, so if you aren't aware, you might think the temp is too cold, when in reality, it may be just fine. Easily remedied by tossing it in a small amount of water first before filling the whole basin. Overall, good product, very cute design.",4
2232,"My baby (at the age of 9 month) first hated it. She will not drink a drop of milk from it. At the age of 11 month, I re-introduced it. She took it then and was willing to drink a few gulps from it every time I gave it to her. It is not the continuing drinking that I hoped for, but it is progress.",4
2233,"This cup worked well for my son transitioning from the typical Avent bottles, classic style.  The handles are nice because I could interchange them with the Avent bottle as well, which was wonderful.  I wish I could have purchased the handles alone, but we got good use out of the trainer spout too.",5
2234,"I hated having to keep track of blankets when taking my daughter in and out of the car and this solved all my problems.  It fit will on our Safety 1st car seat and it was so easy to use.  I think this is a must have for all winter babies.",5
2235,"This set is wonderful. It's so sturdy and has held up to abuse from my kids and the dishwasher (top rack only). The bowls are nice and deep, the plates and cups are a great size. Excellent purchase.",5
2236,"Love the bowls.  I like how they go up on the sides- seems to help when they are learning to get things out of bowls.  The cups are perfect for learning to drink out of real cup.  The plates are small for dinner, but work fine for smaller meals.  Really easy to clean.",4
2237,"I bought this for the color and was happy with just that. This is pricey for just 9 square feet. Also, color is lasting ok, starting to see bits flake off to show white underneath. My  toddler has been able to pull the squares apart pretty much since he was an crawling infant, so keeping all the squares together has been an issue too.",1
2238,"It's very firm and can tolerate a toddler jumping on top.I'm pretty sure it'll last for a long time, until it goes toa yard sale it'll still stay in its original shape.It does need a waterproof pad to go with it, to ward offaftermath of accidents.",5
2239,"She sleeps on it and as far as I know she doesn't have any chiropractic issues yet.It functions perfectly as a baby mattress.",5
2240,"I have nothing to compare this mattress to. Let me state that first and foremost.Pros: It is water/mess resistant. It is firm (as they say not to let babies sleep on mattresses that are too plush). It fits perfectly in my DaVinci crib.Being a first time mom, I was LOST in trying to pick out a mattress for my daughter. I wondered if it was too hard, or if the quality was ok. So I went with this one based on other reviews and comparing them to other mattresses online. I bought a (thin) mattress pad for it. But that is my neurosis more than anything. She seems to like it just fine though, as she has no trouble sleeping at night. So I will call that a win.",4
2241,"No issues with this mattress; used it for our baby from 2 months to present (7 months) with zero issues. Nice and firm without being hard. No complaints.",5
2242,"I LOVE these receiving blankets! They are not only soft and well made but I LOVE the colors as well. Loved these so much, ordered another pack!",5
2243,"my cousin bought this for my son's baby shower and recently, it's become his favorite toy.  We decided to buy two more to have as backups (one can go to grandma's house, and we can have two at home in case one's in the wash).  The two i just bought were the same good quality, however they were slightly different than the original one we received about 2 years ago.  The horns are a little shorter and harder, the face is a little wider, etc.  Obviously this won't matter to people buying this for the first time, but i wanted to point it out.I saw other reviewers mentioned that they found the leaf separated and in their children's cribs so i tugged at it pretty hard and it wouldn't come out.  None of the pieces tore - both of the giraffes i received were really good quality (and super-soft too).I like that these are a little larger than most lovies, and they come in a nice box which is great for gift-giving.  They make a gentle rattle sound when you shake them (it's never woken up my son) and the leaf crinkles (barely even noticeable since it's pretty small)I would definitely recommend this",5
2244,"This is a beautiful soft lovey with a gentle rattle and crinkly leaf.  It's calming and not annoying to nearby adults.  However, my little boy was hardly 4 months when the leaf fell off his lovey.  This was without washing it or much use at all because, well, a 4 month old can't do a whole lot at this point.  Now at five months he began chewing on the trunk so I thought it was time to give it a wash.  I followed the instructions (and I even put it in a net garment bag to wash it in) and when I pulled it out of the washing machine the head of the elephant was barely hanging on.This was a gift off of my registry...and it's been more than three months so I didn't bother trying to return it but I feel that I must warn other parents. Buy with caution and if you do buy this you might want to reinforce all the seems yourself.",1
2245,"I love this snuggle sack, it's sooo adorable! And the material is so soft and nice to touch. It's well made and high quality. My only take is that the cap is too small to fit my 1mo infant who has a normal sized head, and this is supposed to last for 6 months.",4
2246,"It's very very cute, but the material it is made with is quite cheap, and after you wash it, even if you use fabric softener, it is still quite rough.",3
2247,"These are miracle workers in my opinion. Cute pattern also. I will definitely buy more of these in the future.",5
2248,"Out of the box it's ready to go. It caught the attention of my then eight month old grandson. It is exactly as it looks with it's variety of activities. Over the past two months ma grandson has played and I have seen the changes in fine motor activities. It's sturdy he has thrown it from time to time. The greatest things  reported by his parents it doesn't have sound and doesn't need batteries. I guess Grandma did good with this pick.",5
2249,"Sometimes it is very hard to rate baby toys because some babies are fascinated by them but others are not. I would unfortunately have to say that our baby was not fascinated by this toy. I think there might actually been too much going on with this toy from the multiple spinners to the small balls. Basically our babies interaction with the toy is to hold it up and then shake it and then put it down and go to another toy.",3
2250,"Our 10 month old child gets bored in his carseat and this thing is a lifesaver.  It's annoying, but a crying baby every time you go into the car is much more annoying!",5
2251,"I am new to cloth diapering and when I made the decision to cloth diaper I was very overwhelmed with all the different types of diapers out there. I somehow stumbled upon the &#34;hybrid&#34; type diaper system and realized that was going to be the best system for me. It seemed simple enough. Purchase shells and snap in corresponding pads. I liked that the shells could be used multiple times which would cut down on the amount of laundry.  I also figured it was a great way to slowly emerge myself into cloth diapering. I found on NIckisdiapers.com that the two &#34;hybrid&#34; systems that matched my budget were the Best Bottom diapers and the Grovia's. I ordered both systems and figured after a few uses I would probably prefer one over the other.Its been about 2 months now and I really don't have a favorite yet. I love both systems. With the Grovias I love that they are trim and not bulky. I also like that only one size soaker pad is needed  and I don't have to buy larger sizes as my little one grows. My only complaints thus far are minimal. I wish they had more color choices available and that the soaker pads didn't take as long to dry.The best bottom diapers come in an array of colors which I love! they do have a nice trim fit but don&#8217;t seem to fit as well around my little ones thighs. They have double gussets which makes it thicker and gives her a &#8220;splayed&#8221; legs position. I wish the soaker pads were just one size. Purchasing different sizes as the child grows isn&#8217;t as economical as other systems. I do like that the pads are trim and do not take that long to dry.If your thinking about doing a hybrid system and can&#8217;t decide which brand to go with I would recommend either to you. I would say give them both a try and I think you would be happy with either",5
2252,"This bag works very well for taking along in the diaper bag. It holds about 5-6 diapers (insert+shell). There is no smell from the diaper bag. The rope and closure are durable and seals in the smell very well. Great take everywhere diaper bag. Great grovia quality.",5
2253,"I use these on my baby since she was small. They hold up good now she's 8 months. I use them for everything. Looking to buy another pack.",5
2254,"The front side (one with design) is a little rough but the back side is soft. These aren't very thick but that makes them great for getting between your little one's leg and arm rolls. :-P",4
2255,"Easily clips to seat, and if bumped because it's in the way comes off without breaking. This has allowed our daughter to be like everyone else and have a cup holder to access her drink while in the car.",5
2256,"I bought this to see if it would keep my toddler (21 mo old boy) from chunking his cup in the car to places I couldn't find or retrieve for him while driving. Yes, it's worked! He now knows that's where his cup goes and has a place for it! I'd of course be happier with Britax if these items came with the expensive car seats and strollers instead of a la carte, but eh, whatcha gonna do. It works!",5
2257,"I wish that Britax would have included this cup holder instead of having it as an additional accessory, that is the one downfall of the carseat that you have to buy extras. With that being said, I am glad that I purchased this; instead of having tossed sippy cups my little one now knows where to put her cup.Pros:- Sturdy plastic- Easy to Install- Holds a large cupCons:- The cup is on a swivel; and if you hit it; the cup holder moves. I thought that it would lock into place but it still rotates.Overall, I am glad that I purchased this item, it is nice to have a place to put your cup. If you have a Britax carseat and need a cup holder I would recommend it; it does the job.",4
2258,"we got this holder along with the car seat and its flimsy. the cup holder tilts outward away from seat and falls off easily. not impressed.",2
2259,"I was one of those moms who never carried a bag to dispose of my kid's diaper, whenever we travelled. I always made a mental note to bring a bag before we left the house, but it never happened. Then, I saw these and decided to get them. I just keep them in the diaper bag and I never have to worry what I'm going to do with her dirty diapers.",5
2260,"I borrowed one for my first child.  Had to have my own for the second baby!  The color is awesome.  The fabric is soft.  The baby loves it too I think because no complaints :)",5
2261,"We purchased the ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier for baby's first trip to NYC. We wanted to avoid having a stroller in Times Square, and this carrier was the best solution. Baby was secure the entire time, yet was still able to &#34;sight-see&#34; along with us. The carrier was easy to use, and comfortable for both baby and me. I also loved the little attached hoodie, which gave baby some shade and helped combat the light rain shower we ran into.",5
2262,"These are great for rinsing, and my baby loves to play with them. They have been our favorite bath toys from the beginning.",5
2263,"This has been the perfect carrier for baby #3 and I wish I had it for my first two (I used an Ergo, which I love, but wasn't ideal for my frame at 5'4&#34; and 110). The criss cross straps make a snug and comfortable fit. I was able to begin using it when baby was 8 pounds and we're still going at 18 pounds (and I have not found purchasing the waist strap necessary...yet).",5
2264,"I got this for my son, we have a new baby so his high chair had to go to someone else. He loves it and feels like a big boy when he uses it. East to clean and easy to install.",4
2265,"My son (12 weeks today) LOVES this - even more than his swing. Its great, easy to move around, light-weight, easy to clean. I can move the seat quickly and easily. He sits in it and watched me in the kitchen, getting ready in the morning, or I can feed him in the chair if I am pumping at night.  Great price, so in the event he didn't like it, its not like the $200 swing he won't sit in any more.",5
2266,"My little boy loves this thing. Great buy and half the price of any where else.",5
2267,"We purchased this jumper when my daughter was 5 months old and have had it now for a while. The whole deal was pretty simply to put together and is quite sturdy. The toys on the tray are fun for her to play with as it has mirrors, rattles, a bar with sliding toys, lights and music. The toys that hang from the leaves on top however are probably going to need to be removed. She likes to pull down on them to play with and every time she does this it weakens the plastic where it clicks into the top of the white 'ball' above the straps. It has obvious fractures in the plastic and I am worried it will break off. My sister has another version of this jumperoo and the hanging toys on hers show the same wear. I wish that this part of the toy was more durable but this is an otherwise good product.",4
2268,"My son loved this thing for months. It took him a little while to like it at first, but after about a week, he would jump and squeal in boisterous glee while jumping. At 10 months, he doesn't really jump in it anymore, but he does pull himself up to standing outside it and play with it sometimes, so we have not yet packed it away.",4
2269,"Looks like a toy. We thought it was much bigger than it actually is. The rubber is not the softest and the ratteler inside could get annoying. Not as bendy as we thought. For the price it was not worth it...but at least i can give it to the dog...cheaper than buying a dog toy.",2
2270,"David's wife here...our 7 month old has a love/hate relationship with this swing.  Depending on her age and mood.  We got this when she was about 3 months old and it was a life saver.  She's now starting to get antsy in it, so we just use it for nap time.  The swing takes up a lot of space.  Not just the legs but the movement of the swing.  We like how it can face 3 different ways though (right/left/forward).  The seat can change position too which is nice.  The music it plays is perfect - goes for a long enough period of time to get her to fall asleep then turns off on its own.  Plus, it plays our wedding song which was a happy accident.  But the motor seems to be dying out (had it about 4 months now).  The speeds of the swing are less accurate as it gets older.  We just put it up to the fastest (level &#34;5&#34;) automatically now bc level &#34;1-3&#34; barely move anymore.  But the reviews we read warned us of the motor and how it lasts about 6 months.  Overall, this was a great purchase.  Even if she ends up hating it after a few more months or if it dies out in two, it gave us some sanity when we needed it most!",4
2271,"I've had 5 babies and tried 4 different swings. This is by far the best! I love the side to side motion. The side to side motion helps my babies fall asleep and be soothed way better than front to back.I love the soft colors! It's not a giant gaudy eyesore sitting in the corner of the room.But the BEST part after the side to side motion is the CORD. Plugging this into the wall saves SO much money on batteries!! I mean, SO MUCH! When I had my third child we had a swing that worked similarly with a side to side motion and he liked it but it used D batteries and we'd go through so many! They just breezed on through a pack of batteries and we all know how expensive batteries are! Especially size D! I think in total we save about $20 a month on batteries being able to plug the swing into the wall.",5
2272,"I had a cheap swing that someone gifted us but with a colicky baby it didn't cut the mustard. In a sleep deprived panic I ordered this hoping for a little relief. My baby loved it and I loved being able to set her down for half an hour without crying. It looks nice, and best of all the music is peaceful and not annoying. Its great that it plugs in so you don't have to hassle with batteries all the time.",5
2273,"Pros for this swing:- Very soft, snuggly, fabric.- Mobile with lights, sound, and movement.Cons- The motor broke almost immediately, causing me to return this swing.",2
2274,"I love this swing!  It's on the more expensive side, but is definitely worth it. (especially if it is a gift!) Easy to assemble, easy to wash, and well made. I've also used the ""Graco Duet Soothee Swing & Rocker"" and MUCH prefer my Fisher-Price Snugabunny.  The Graco swing is loud, the vibration makes a rattling sound so loud you can't hear the music, and the buttons felt chintzy.I love that you can change the directly of the swing, and the angle of the seat.The swing is surprisingly easy to transport for not being ""portable"" - we take it almost everywhere!We have had no problems with flat head.Directions say to push the swing to get it started. It does not start well on its own. By doing this, we have had no problems with the motor.I definitely recommend!*updates*I love that it takes batteries AND plugs in! This is has been a life saver during power outages - the power went out, and the battery power took over without missing a beat.This is wonderfully easy to wash and dry! I just threw it in with the rest of my wash on delicate cycle, and low heat dry.  It drys VERY fast and there was no shrinkage.",5
2275,"I purchased this when my son was very young and it was one of the first baby holder type items I got. My favorite thing about it is how snugly my son would sit in it when he was a new born.  It's almost like a rock n play  in its snugness with the newborn insert, and without it as well as your baby grows. My baby is not amused by the vibration or the music though, but every baby is different. I purchased this before I really knew what a bouncer was, so understand that if you want it to bounce your baby needs to wiggle around a lot or you can bounce it yourself by hand.  My son didn't even notice the birds really until almost here months old and when it soon came time to want to grab them they are always out of his reach which both of us find annoying.  I'm not sure why the toy bar is so high. At four months he still can't reach them, so I guess they aren't meant to be grabbed or batted at by baby.",3
2276,"It seems my baby doesn't like it that much. He will continue to cry after we put him in it if he already starts crying.  I threw away the package otherwise will return it",3
2277,"My son never really like being in bouncers or swings or anything that restrained him, but when he was in a mellow mood, I would put him in this bouncer and set him on the bathroom floor next to the tub while I took a bath and it was great for both of us! He seemed to like the little birds dangling above him and the music and vibration made him happy, if only for a short time. It was really easy to get him in and out of the seat and the harness is very practical and simple to use. I especially liked that the plush fabric cleaned very easily and I was able to keep the bouncer in pristine condition so it can be used again for another baby.",5
2278,"We love this bouncer. The vibrate is great and it's so easy to bounce. This is a lifesavor. We cannot get our child to sleep with out it.  The only this is is reclines a lot and if you bounce it to hard you can hit the floor. Other than that, this is perfect!!! Very comfy, very cute!",5
2279,"Thank goodness for this bouncy seat. My baby sits and watches her older brother happily from this seat during mealtimes or watches me while I am prepping food, etc. She is comfortable and enjoys kicking vigorously and making the seat bounce. As a newborn she would also nap in the seat. Now as a four-month-old she can grab the toys on the arch and enjoy the toys and music for five or ten minutes here and there. And she still finds the seat comfy and enjoys sitting in it. I got it for a great price as well, and it is easy to assemble and keep clean. I also have the much more expensive Baby Bjorn Balancesitter, and the baby does not like that seat as much. The monkey seat is the clear winner. My only issue with the seat is watch out for the two legs that stick out at the front. They provide the seat with stability and a good bounce, but they also provide adults with a great place to stub their toes. Still worth it though!",5
2280,"Our little one is cutting both the top teeth and since buying this seems to be a lot happier.  I was pretty unsure about this and heard great things.  I am not sure if our timeing was right or it really works.  I guess we will find out when those molars come in.  I still recommend this as it doesn't hurt to try.  We do not leave it on his neck at night but do wrap it around his ankle.",5
2281,"I love this line of security blankets, I had the giraffe ones for my first daughter and the second one loves the pink poodles! It's easy for baby to hold and cuddle with these! She won't fall asleep with out it!They wash well and stay soft, even the 3 year old ones are still in great shape! Makes a great gift as well, I'd highly recommend these!",5
2282,"We received several loveys as gifts at my baby shower, but my child eventually bonded with his Angel Dear brown puppy lovey. No other lovey would do because &#34;Lovey Puppy&#34; was so soft. When Lovey Puppy was accidentally torn to shreds by my mother-in-law's golden retriever, my child was devastated.Angel Dear no longer seem to sell the brown puppy lovey (I'm not sure why, because it was so cute), so I took a gamble and bought the twin pack of Angel Dear &#34;Brown Bear&#34; loveys from Amazon. When the package arrived just a couple of days later, he was so happy! Though the loveys were bears, not a puppy, it was the same color and felt soft, just like his Lovey Puppy did.Now we have two Lovey Bears, just in case one gets lost or needs a &#34;bath&#34;. They wash up nicely in the washing machine, which is good because they do get stinky after awhile. We're also careful to keep them out of reach when grandma's real doggie comes to visit.If you're considering these as a shower gift, these loveys are adorable, and the package is soooo cute. It's also very forward-thinking to purchase the twin pack. New moms probably won't think of this, but they'll discover the benefits soon enough. (3-packs are also available for purchase with the cute name &#34;A pair and a spare&#34;.)",5
2283,"These are a wonderful gift!  My son has about five of these now and loves them.  He sleeps with them, takes them everywhere, and loves to chew on them while teething.  They were a wonderful comfort my little guy when transitioning into his crib from the cradle and offer security wherever he goes.  We have several because being white they do get dirty fast since my son is constantly carrying one with him.  They wash easily though and hold up well.",5
2284,"I use it to cover outlets I do not use. It is easy to just cover them. I'm afraid if I use it my baby will learn to move the cover or pull the plug off. That's my only concern.",4
2285,"This activity gym is perfect,the colors are beautiful,the animals are so cute ,my baby boy loves talking to the squirrel .i am very happy about this product.",5
2286,"She spends time with it in independent play...started playing with it around 4 mo age, usually bats it and talks to the birds...I love that is has extra hooks to hang other toys as well.....I like that is is safe for my baby: low on chemicals, fabric toys....love the sound the owl parrot and birdie make.....daughter does play with mirror much.",5
2287,"We were playing at a friend&#8217;s house and she had this adorable owl. My son spent 15 minutes playing with it, so she insisted that I take it home since her child never really liked it. This has been a wonderful toy for a baby that doesn&#8217;t really play with much. It&#8217;s perfect because he can entertain himself for the right amount of time for me to get a shower or do some laundry.I put him in his recline seat and he has a blast with his owl. It is big enough that it never falls beyond his reach, like his small rattles do. He pushes it around, grabs the rings and makes noise with the crinkly arms. The crinkly arms are very loud (no sure how to describe it). We have a few crinkly toys that don&#8217;t crinkle as much&#8230; but this one makes a decent amount of noise when you barely touch it. It&#8217;s great that it has a little owl that fits in the pouch that squeaks when you squeeze it, but that&#8217;s a little advanced for my son now. He&#8217;s just having a blast with the ring, crinkly arms and mirror. The colors are perfect and go with our brown and earthy tones we&#8217;ve chosen for our nursery. It matches his bedding and swing, so the owl just hangs out when he&#8217;s not playing with it and looks right at home. The negative side to that is that at this age higher contrast (black, white, red) is easier for baby to see, so I don&#8217;t know how stimulating the colors are for him.  I&#8217;m grateful that I got it for free, but the $18 price tag is a little high. I am concerned with the reviews that said the wooden ring broke. I will definitely monitor him closely when he plays with it the older he gets. Thank you for writing a review to warn the rest of us who haven&#8217;t had any problems so we can be extra careful!",4
2288,"I used disposable pads for the first 6 months to handle heavy leaking, and have only minor leaking to control now.These do seem to be of good quality but as other reviewers have stated, they do tend to shift a bit, sometimes poking out of the top of my bra. I have noticed that it really makes a difference what kind of bra I'm wearing; I have more of a problem with bras that have molded cups, since they aren't as tight to hold things in place. If only the outer fabric wasn't as slick I don't think it would be as much of a problem. My other issue is that when I do have a small amount of leakage, the pad stays wet--there is no wicking action in the fabric, so wetness will stay wet and you need to change it as soon as possible. This is a little inconvenient when wearing these and nursing outside the house. I used a different brand in the past that had microfleece that allowed me to stay dry even after leaking a small amount.My favorite thing about these pads, however is that they do not show through my bra and shirt, due to the design and fabric. I have had other pads that looked like giant pancakes and these are a big improvement.",4
2289,"Purchased these for obvious reasons, work great nice and thin so I can wear them in any bra. The heart shape is cute too and does not show through bras or clothing. I've washed them a few time and still going strong. I wish they dried a little quicker. Better than using disposable ones!",5
2290,"These have been wonderful! I have also tried the synthetic disposable ones and it is a HUGE difference. First of all there is no icky glue residue left behind with these and secondly they are so much more comfortable! I have had to deal with breastmilk  leaking and these have been more than fine in allowing me to feel secure. Definitely recommend this!",5
2291,"We got this toy for my son before he was 6months and he didn't really care for it. I was kind of sad. However one day he discovered it and it is still one of his favorite toys at 10 months.",5
2292,"Perfect book for little hands that like to grab. There are different textures/flaps on each page and there is a mirror on the last one (that's my son's favorite part). I like the cloth pages that can be spot-cleaned and cannot be ripped apart.",5
2293,"Best book ever! Baby loves this over most other teething blanket nubby tether bla bla..... Wasted money on many other items. This is all we need after all!",5
2294,"This was one of the first books I ever bought my grand-daughter and she absolutely loved it!  We have since bought many other books, but this remained one of her favorites.",5
2295,"It took us 3 hours to install this in our truck that does not have the latch system.  Trying to use the locking bar was horrible.  Now, it is extremely difficult to tighten and loosen the harness strap which to me is very dangerous in an emergency situation.  I have to use all my strength in order to loosen the strap with one hand while pushing the button with the other.  Not safe and I have a hard time trying to get ahold of anyone at Dorel.  You have to email.  Would never buy again.  I have like our Evenflo Symphony that we have in our other car.  Much easier to use!",1
2296,"It is perfect for using with the baby's stroller or baby's car seat. It does not blow a lot of air but it is really helpful in summer days!",5
2297,"My son has ripped the fan blades off each time ive bought one so I started using it in the car inteead of the stroller(where he cant rreach it) This fan truly has NO output...I have no idea why I bought another one...THe idea is great because it is safe to put your hand in but rips easily, no out put and uses up batteries like theres no tomorrow.",2
2298,"We bought this to use on our 10 month old's stroller for a 5 day trip to Arizona in June with temperatures ranging 100-110 degrees every day. I chose this fan because it was the least expensive one I could find and I must say I'm impressed! It securely clipped onto her stroller, put off a nice breeze and only came off once when she pulled it down. When she did get a hold of it, there was no damage to it at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I only wish I had gone ahead and bought two - one for baby and one for me!",5
2299,"This is everything I wanted from a little clip-on fan.  The clip is really strong and won't fall off.  The switch is easy to operate, and I have tried multiple times to get the fan blades to hurt me just to see if my kids could do it - so far, it has proven totally safe.  It produces a nice strong breeze for such a small fan.  Keeps baby cool and bug-free outside in the summer!",5
2300,"This fan was great while we were using it, but we soon found that we had to replace the battery with every car trip.",3
2301,"Pros: Strong clip that opens very wide so you can attach it to car seat handles, head rests, anything. Soft blades-- my baby likes to grab it and it just gently stops, doesn't hurt him at all. Bendable neck is easy to shape to direct air wherever I need it but strong enough that it holds position.Only con: Runs on AA batteries and only lasts me about a week.Bottom line: I definitely recommend this product but suggest you invest in rechargeable batteries!",4
2302,"The fan blades were chewed to bits once his teeth came in. I'm sure he swallowed some but I preferred to assume nature would take its course rather than go searching for blue bits. So it's safe...from a distance.",4
2303,"It's pretty strong for a little fan like that. We just got it so no problems with it yet. Little one seems to enjoy it and it makes us happy!",5
2304,"This is great! I get lot's of mom's that ask me where I bought this little fan and in the desert heat where I live my baby really needs this! I'll use it in the car too so she get's an extra breeze in the back seat and it's soft foam blades wont hurt her when she tries to grab it",5
2305,"Clips on easily and works well. Able to adjust location by movable neck.  Blades are easy to rip off by little hands.",3
2306,"6 month old ripped the fan blades off within a few days a getting this.  This fan is safe but just did not work well for our child.",1
2307,"Love this blanket.  Both sides are super soft and my daughter loved it from the time she was born.  It washes well and has been a favorite for three months now.One con is I that the fuzzy side looses fuz.  If a pacifier that is wet gets onto the blanket it will get fuzz on it.  It is easy to wash off but can be a pain in the middle of then go night.",4
2308,"Meets expectations and helps 2 year old daughter with washing hands. Not a life changing addition. Now that we have a better stool where our daughter can reach it's really not needed anymore.",3
2309,"Not a great fit for small sinks. Wideness leaves less room for my and my toddlers hands to be in sink at same time.",2
2310,"Falls off a lot",3
2311,"My 2.5 yr old daughter loves to wash her hands. Plus I'm a bit of a germaphobe anyway, so I wash her hands quite a bit. This makes my job so much easier because she can stand and reach the water herself. Paired with a step stool, the water comes close enough that she can do everything almost unassisted (as long as I turn on the water). I love my daughter but she as getting heavy to hold over the sink for a handwashing!",5
2312,"These are a little weighty and perfectly suited to little hands; not like the thin baby spoons. I will be buying a second set to keep in the diaper bag!",5
2313,"I have been using these for several months. They hold up well to everyday use. The handles are steady and the metal is not flimsy. The spoon is a great size for my 2 1/2 year olds. They love using the fork to  pick up their food.",5
2314,"These have been good spoons for beginners. Especially good for watered down oatmeal, etc. They are like tiny little shovels. We've been using them for about 4 months and they've held up well.",5
2315,"These spoons feel like silicone so they are soft, and flexible. My baby loves to chew on these while I am feeding him. The only con that I have to report is that while most baby foods stain your baby's bibs and clothes it will also discolor these spoons, even after multiple washings. I still like them though, I also have the yellow/orange unisex set that I had bought when my daughter was a baby.",4
2316,"Our son has three sets of grandparents, and this made for a great first Christmas gift for them. Easy enough to do it, and I swapped out the included pink and blue ribbons for something a little more stylish. Only complaint is that the clay cracks just a bit as it dries-- tiny surface cracks, mostly around the edges. I sanded them lightly and it helped a bit.",4
2317,"We love this chair! It's easy to clean (removable tray also fits easily into our dishwasher) and since we leave it out 100% of the time, I appreciate that it doesn't stand out too much from our other furniture. My daughter always seems comfortable.The only downside is that you can't remove the tray with one hand, but we almost always just pull it out to the very end and take my daughter out without even removing it so it's never been an issue.",5
2318,"There is nothing better than having no idea what to order, following a well reviewed product, and totally agreeing with the other reviewers that this is an excellent chair.  Cleans up easily, and it holds our toddler in safely.  Plus he has room to grow with the chair being adjustable.",5
2319,"This brush works well and looks cute, but don't expect it to last forever.  Natural bristles and wood + water = possible mildew.  Put it in the sun to dry after uses if you can.  The finish will start wearing off and there might be some discoloration around the base of the bristles.  I've had similar issues with wooden/natural dish brushes.",4
2320,"Not a day passes without needing these!They're hollow and see through. Looking through the cavity while the baby is chewing on them is mesmerising 0_0 hehePlus, if you look at them while the nipple is facing you directly, you'll notice that they're shaped to look like a smiling pinocchio :o)",5
2321,"Well, I bought these since my son refused to take the NUK ones because of the shape of the nipple. And since I've seen that hospitals use these, I figured we'd try them. For some reason it makes my son gag every time we try to give it to him. We ended up just going for the Avent ones that had the straight nipples. But, that's just my son's experience, every baby is different.",3
2322,"They're soft on little mouths, you can put your finger in the front to help the little one latch on, and they're SUPER easy to clean",4
2323,"My baby sleeps with those, and sometimes it becomes a habit that he will not go to sleep without those. You don't want your babies to rely on those too much, but at the same time this will save you all the hassle or comforting them and trying to put them to sleep.",5
2324,"I love all of the Philips Avent pacifiers. My baby loves them. He is 7 months old now and these are still his favorite (now he tries to stick the whole thing in his mouth). Somewhere I read that all of the colors are vanilla scented, though, and that isn't true. The only pacifiers that have the vanilla scent are the light green. While I like the yellow color, any color with the vanilla scent is better, at least it has been for my baby.",4
2325,"The Soothie is the only pacifier that our baby will take. The pink and purple ones are great and make our little girl look even cuter!",5
2326,"We tried all kinds.  This one was the only one she would take.  The hospital had these when our kid was in the NICU so we kept using them.",4
2327,"Neither of my babies liked these.  My toddler never liked a paci at all.  My baby only likes MAM brand.  I was hoping they would use this brand because of the wubbies, but no such luck.",1
2328,"Easy to use and clean, although by two months I am no longer using this in the car seat- too small for baby's head",5
2329,"The info for this product says that it can be used for infants or preemies.... This is WAY too big for a preemie! Otherwise, it's a fine product.",3
2330,"I have a jogging stroller that I love to use but they never make the seats comfy for newborns. This works great for my 2.5 month old son and keeps him happy. I read some reviews where people were using the product for several months so I'm glad its not something that will only fit my son for a few weeks. Totally worth it. Do wish the color was darker though. Gets dirty easily.",5
2331,"Use them as a extra layer of comfort, but do not expect them to be like sleeping in the clouds.",4
2332,"I loved this infant snuzzler. I used it for my daughter from the time she came home from the hospital to the time she turned 18 months when she didn't really need it anymore and fit in her care seat just fine.",5
2333,"I have to admit, I didn't use this as the primary way it was intended for. Under supervision, I would lay this down in her crib or on a couch or bed (with me being right there to ensure safetly) to give my baby head support and to feel snuggly while lying down. I would place a thin blanket on top so the velcro (in between the head part and the body part) wouldn't poke through and scratch. The pillow part is really low so suffocation risk is really low. It is easily washable and the terry-cloth fabric is soft. I stopped using it at 2 months because she outgrew it but she is larger for her age. The carseat I bought (chicco keyfit 30) provided enough headsupport so I didn't need it for the carseat/carrier.",4
2334,"I did not put the bottom parts on to make it a rocker. I just left it as a chair. It arrived in one piece, so not assembly was required. It is not the most comfortable chair because it seems somewhat hard. My child doesn't seem to mind though.",3
2335,"I really love these bags! I have 3 of them for cloth diapering and these are by far my favorite. The only complaint I have is that the outside shrinks so much after washing that it's kind of an annoyance to stuff the waterproof part back in. But seriously, they are thick and well made and I'd buy more if there were any reason!",5
2336,"My son absolutely loves this product.  So far, so good!  He plays piano with his feet while he is exploring all the rest of it.  It keeps him busy for way longer than any of his other floor toys including his mat.  :)",5
2337,"Loved this wedge.  I was a belly sleeper prior to being pregnant so when I became pregnant and had a belly, I now had a watermelon on my belly and had to sleep on my side... this pillow helped keep the weight of my belly off of my back and just made it much more comfortable to sleep.  After I had the baby, I used this wedge under her mattress when I needed to elevate her mattress.",5
2338,"We mostly let our daughter play on the floor, so we never bought a jumparoo or its like, but as she got a little more mobile, we did occasionally want to be able to secure her.  This seat was a great find.  She could sit in it for short periods of time and we could attach our own toys (no &#34;overstimulation station&#34;).  And it packed up well for travel and picnicking.  My only trouble was that I was never quite sure it was the right height for her; I didn't know how to tell if she was putting too little/ too much weight on her legs before she could really stand on her own.  So we used it very minimally during that stage.",5
2339,"I purchased one of these back in April and it was great. A solid 4-star product. I liked it so much that I wanted another for grandma's house. Unfortunately, the newer model is absolute crap. The fabric is completely different, much thinner and cheaper. So much thinner, in fact, that within 2 minutes of placing my 8 month old in it the fabric began tearing at the four attachment points at each corner. So disappointing! I will be returning it (at my cost as it was not fulfilled by Amazon). If you can still get the P7001 model, go for that one.",1
2340,"I thought I was going to love this bag because it was comfortable on my shoulder and had a lot of nice compartments for organization. Sadly, it was not realistic for me. First, the opening to the bag is sort of small so when you are in a panic and looking for a burp cloth to catch whatever body fluid the baby is expelling, you can't really get a good look inside. The many pockets let to never being able to find anything. I ended up going for another bag with a wider opening and less pockets which actually created better organization.",3
2341,"We did a lot of research and were pretty excited about this bag but in the end it got replaced. First by the old one and then by another new one. The real deal killer for this was that it just didn't open wide enough. So even though it probably holds as much as our other ones, it just doesn't feel like it. And everything certainly is not as accessable. With our other bags you can open them wide and find anything you have put in there. With this one it is more like rummaging through the bottom of a back pack. Just not what we were looking for ultimately. Sad, because everything else about the bag was really good, but not good enough to overcome that one short fall.",3
2342,"but it is so difficult to open. I have to use a butter knife to pop the lids. The lids aren't clear so you can't see what inside. But they are the perfect size.The ice pack is useless but the the carrying case is nice in the diaper bag.",3
2343,"This is a great booster seat, looks high quality, easy to use, nice neutral colors, and comfortable for my now 6 year old daughter (bought when she was 5). Looks like it's still brand new. I've always liked Britax carseats and they continue to impress.",5
2344,"She pets his ears and pulls his face to hers when she is sleepy. She can easily find it at night and his ears helps her know which end to insert. ;)",5
2345,"Elephant wubbanub is super cute!  We also have a frog one.  Our son is 4mths old and just learning to hold the wubbanub in his mouth.  The elephant doesn't lay as flat to his body and the floppy ears draw the attention of his hands, so he pulls/drops the elephant more often than the frog.",4
2346,"My son is 11 months old and still uses this pacifier exclusively (even though it's a newborn size).  It was great when he was younger because it was easy for him to hold onto.  I've been giving it as gifts to other pregnant moms.  Makes a cute gift!",5
2347,"I have owned 1 other bottle warmer and this one. At this price point you could possiblyfind something more affordable for the features.Although this has some good features like adjustable temperatures, wide opening for food jars or bottles, goodlooking, bpa free and no alarm (this one can be a con too).The downside is no auto shut off, alarm, a little loud (but most are), the price.As a basic bottle warmer is a great unit. It heat your baby bottle quickly but you have to watch or else it wouldget too hot for baby--which I have done, walked away and it would over heat. This is when an auto shut off wouldcome in handy.I do love the neutral colors and the overall design.",4
2348,"I had these with my babies and they are SO great. Now I give one to all my pregnant friends as a baby gift. Once a child can set off the vibration they will gnaw on it for a while and it seems to be very soothing.",5
2349,"So far so good, it helps with poo diapers. I don't like the flash em but its easier to clean up",5
2350,"They do the job and don't leave a lot of residue on baby. Other, more papery, brands left loads of lint and looked and felt like wet paper towels when dirty - like they'd just rip apart. Grovia's are really light and don't stay wet like the others. Now that baby is more wiggly on the changing table, I have noticed that these can rip and leave residue as well, but its not nearly as bad as the other ones were.I started using these around 5-7 months after we started baby on solid foods. LOVED the transition. So much better than not using anything on cloth diapers. And when baby would occasionally have a really soft (mostly milk, not solid foods) poop diaper, these liners still worked! So next time, I'm going to start using them sooner.Now that baby has really solid poops I don't feel like I have to use these all the time, because the poop is going to knock right off the cloth diapers anyway. But liners are still a must on large poops, runny poops, and stealth poops that you accidentally let baby rub into the diaper bc you didn't notice it happened. I therefore, might not use one immediately after i change a poop diaper, and definitely use a liner during/after meal times. I'm not a fan of reusing them. I can see why its done, and have tried it, but typically I choose not to reuse them.",5
2351,"Necklace came with a broken bead. I bought two in same transaction and both came broken. Returned them immediately. Scary that moms are putting these on their babies since they fall apart.Dark necklace is deceiving. I figured it was darker amber but it's not. It's got color added on outside (wouldn't have known if the broken bead wasn't in the bag so I could see).Bought similar product from another distributor and was happy, so is my baby girl who it appears to be helping.",1
2352,"You won't believe how good this pillow is! With this amazing pillow you even have to support your baby with your arm. My wife simply place our baby girl on the pillow and she's already level with her breast. This pillow encourages a healthy posture for nursing mommies and even for daddies who bottle feed their little ones.Best of all, this pillow doesn't 'shapeshift' with usage like your regular nursing pillow.I couldn't use this pillow without a pillow cover because I worried all the time that it's going to be ruined by baby vomit or worse. I then bought one over from eBay and my wife and I have been enjoying this pillow ever since.",5
2353,"It's a great pillow for the first month or so (of breastfeeding), but after your baby grows, it's very hard to level the baby with the mom's chest when the pillow is underneath. You also have to switch it from side to side, as one of the sides is much larger than the other.  It was very odd to bottle feed with it.",4
2354,"I love the shape of this pillow, putting baby at a slight angle.  The big end is quite a bit thicker than a boppy pillow, which works great for taller moms like me.  I'm not nearly as hunched as I am with the boppy, making it a more comfortable experience for baby and I.  Flipping it over to switch sides is a non-issue, once you get used to it.  I even sewed a couple covers out of fleece to save $$, and they have worked great.  Highly recommend!",5
2355,"These are perfect for sending bottles to daycare. The self-laminating is a breeze and hasn't worn at all in a month of daily use and washing each night in the dishwasher. It's even easy to write on top with the date each day and then wipe off with rubbing alcohol for the next day. Definitely recommend!",5
2356,"Ordered these labels after I got tired of labeling bottles with a Sharpie.  The labels were easy to write on, and easy to &#34;self-laminate.&#34; I even managed to write small enough that I could cut each label in half and use both halves. When I put them on the bottles, I worried a little because they didn't lay flat on the bottles (Philips Avent).  However, two months later and they're sticking strong. No additional bubbling or peeling whatsoever.Highly recommend.",5
2357,"Great product. It works perfectly. It stays in place after multiple washes  in the dishwasher and it is easy to use.",5
2358,"I bought these labels to label my son's bottles for day care. They were extremely easy to write on and attach to the bottles. I have dishwashed and sterilized the bottles several times, and the labels look brand new. I cut one label into 6 pieces to label the bottle tops with my son's initials. These labels also held up GREAT, so I labeled his spoons the same way.",5
2359,"These are a hit with my baby! He loves them. It keeps him entertained in his car seat. He also enjoys it attached to the jungle gym. This one us a winner!!! Compared to the many other failed items i have purchased for the baby!",5
2360,"These are very charming...but for whatever reason, baby doesn't love them. I'm still rating them highly because they're cute and colorful, very easy to attach to thing, and the chime sound is very gently and pretty, so I do think it's worth a try...your baby might just love them! I haven't given up on these yet, but for now, they don't get that much use. (I have a 4 month old little boy, and I bought these when he was 3 months)In case you're curious for other recommendations, my baby prefers this tiny Taggies Monkey Rattle attached to a stroller strap [http://www.amazon.com/Taggies-Dazzle-Dots-Rattle-Monkey/dp/B00AJF7OZ0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403813270&sr;=8-3&keywords;=taggies+monkey  AND  http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Buddy-Secure-A-Toy-Navy-Blue/dp/B003Y3BH1G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403813279&sr;=8-2&keywords;=stroller+buddy]",4

2363,"It's working well. But there are some improvements to make: it's bulky and there's no timer. Once I opened the lid only to burn my hand because it just finished sterilizing. It could add a warning sign if it's too hot to open, and a safe sign if it cools down. It's very dangerous coz you don't know its temperature from outside. Unless you touch the body each time before opening it.",3
2364,"I was freaked out as I thought my little one had a flat head.  We used this and as soon as the little one started rolling over - had to remove it. The velcro on it is pretty tough and I would find that hubby would put that side up. I do not think it helped our little ones head but we were only able to use it for a couple of weeks - before the rolling over happened.  I will be keeping this and using it later for our toddler.",3
2365,"I bought two of these to help with the baby's flat spot on his head.  These were REALLY expensive, you can get a similar pillow at Walmart for a whole lot less (Like $6).  The fabric is nice, they wash up well, but the little guy has a FIT when we use it, because he's very active, and this keeps him from moving all over the place.  It may work better as a head support in the car seat?",3
2366,"Loved this as a replacement to a simpler one our dog chewed up. Love that the cover is removable & washable. Got a great deal online.",5
2367,"I used a different pillow (Brestfriend) for nursing.  I was actually worried that I wasted $50 on this pillow for the first few months of my baby's life.  However, around six months, she started sitting up on her own, and this pillow became very handy to put around her.",4
2368,"i love that this color is more of a sage green then a lime green.  its very cute fits the pillow nicely, washes well.  its a nice color if you dont know the sex of you baby u are having, it would work well for a boy or girl and i like that it doesnt cost a arm and a leg.  some of the other covers i seen are like 30 dollars, this one is very nice.  it does have long tags hanging off of it i just cut them off",5
2369,"we pulled on the bird a couple of times, and then it ripped off the ring.  Fixable, but I'm a new mom and don't have a lot of bandwidth to repair something I just bought.",2
2370,"I love what I received, but do not think it was worth the price. The picture displayed for selling threw me off - I was expecting three; when I only received one that I already have. You should be able to pick the one you want specially when you have others already. I would not buy anymore from this company....",3
2371,"I was disappointed that we didn't get the giraffe. I didn't read clearly enough that we might not. Oh well. We got the monkey and my baby loves it. One of the few toys we always put in her carseat with her. She can chew on it and it makes just enough noise to entertain her.",5
2372,"Love the color, super easy to attach (only 3 Velcro strips) but very secure. Our 15 month old can't leave any more teeth marks on the railings and has easy access to 3 or his teething toys via toy loops (also durable Velcro).",5
2373,"It fits my crib great, but does very little to protect it. The fabric is too thin and little teeth can leave bite marks right through it. It needs to be made with a thicker inner or under lining. I purchased the gumi rail cover the wrapped this cover around that. Do far, so good.",3
2374,"These work great!  Just for those of you who might not pay a whole lot of attention to things, they're clear... not colored.I got these and then read a lot about how people struggle with getting out the cubes.  Some of my cubes require no weight on the one side to get them out... while others require quite a bit of pressure.  My fingers got cold and I kept running them through warm water but all of the cubes came out just fine and we didn't break the mold!I did warn my husband and tell him how to use it so i don't come home one day to shattered trays.",5
2375,"Love these things they are super nice and the portion size is nice quality is good too I plan on buying more",5
2376,"I have given it a 4 star rating because it's good but not perfect. A lil tweak and it can be :-)I started making my own baby food after I tasted my baby's food one day. If you are not sure if you wanna make your baby food I highly recommend it! JPros:Convenient portion. I started with just one cube and now I give her 3. So it's flexible. You won't be wasting it that way.It's stores flat. So you will have lot of space in the freezer if you are a hoarder like me ;)It's reusable and dishwasher safe!! Less work and mess.Cons:I know they say it very easily that it just pops!! No sorry it doesn't. Esp when you have a toddler's food which is quite thick and not watery juice or milk. It depends on the percentage of water in the food you are storing.One thing I really really HATE in this product is that there is no way you can thaw it under a hot water faucet over/under it without letting some of the water inside. The lids are NOT airtight.I really irritates me.However, I have found a work around for this and works best for me.TIP:  I make my baby food in the night and freeze it in the freezer all night. As soon as I get up in the morning, I leave the trays out for exactly 10 mins. Pop them off and store them in small ziplock bags. That way I can save time when I feed my baby.If the lids had an airtight seal, I would definitely recommend it.",4
2377,"I know, the picture makes these seem too good to be true. You figure, sure, they look all nice and perfect but in reality I bet it's a complete mess and disaster. Wrong - they're actually awesome. I've used them to freeze both fruits and vegetables and never had an issue popping them out - for the veggies (that don't contain natural sugars making them easy to pop out on their own) just run warm water over the back right before popping them out, and voila!I read the other reviews about the difficulty popping them out and was worried, but have been nothing but pleased. I immediately told all my mom friends THESE were the ones they needed to buy,",5
2378,"I really used this really well.  I only bought one set and it was fine.  I used it for breastmilk as well as baby puree.  Now that my twins are 15 months and past the puree stage, we're no longer using these, but I really liked them when I had them.As other users have said, it's easy to pour in breastmilk/food and pop them in the freezer.  24 hours later, take it out, leave it covered for 5-10 minutes until slightly melted and pop them out.  I stored them in freezer bags and labeled with the date and contents with a black permanent marker.These are not 1oz though I would agree with other reviewer.  I would generally put in about 6 cubes in order to get 4oz (of breastmilk).",5
2379,"I use these trays for freezing breast milk and they work like a charm. The cubes are incredibly easy to remove even without running warm water on the back of the tray. Just push on one end of the cube and it slides right out in no time!The plastic is very durable and doesn't warp after regular washing and freezing. The trays are also easy to stack because of the indents on the top of the lid.",5
2380,"Got one at Wal-Mart that had 2 parents units (for $68 or so?), then found this on Amazon and bought one for the grandparents home for when the babies are there..Battery life seems great (10+ hours of use) and everything is SO clear through these.Both bases and monitors use the same adapters, which is awesome. We had a power surge that ruined an adapter and found that as long as we keep the monitor charged when not in use we can just switch the adapter to the base unit when they are used. Saved us money in the long run.",5
2381,"This is a fantastic choice for a basic baby monitor.  I live in the tropics, however, so this is my second unit within a two-year time period, as the humidity takes it's toll on everything.  Also, I live in a 1500 sq ft concrete-walled house so interception can be fuzzy from one end of the house to the other.  That said, it still comes in just fine, despite the minor static here and there.What I do like is that it is simple to use, simple to set up, and the parent unit comes with a rechargeable battery that makes carrying it around very convenient.  The volume is excellent on the parent unit, and the nursery unit is able to pick up any noise in the room without much trouble, even with a fan going.What I do not like are the lights on the parent unit.  In the middle of the night, it acts like a nightlight on your bedside stand--it's very bright and obnoxious.  Additionally, if you plug it in to the wall adapter to charge, another green light flashes.  A simple washcloth over the unit solves that problem, for the most part.  However, I didn't want the sound muffled at all, since I already have fans going in my room, so I took a black permanent marker to it!",4
2382,"The bedding set we bought came with a changing pad cover so I had to buy one for it. This fit just perfectly and I am very pleased with it.",5
2383,"My granddaughter loves this toy the best out of all of her suction toys.  We use it on her walker and I take it to restaurants.",5
2384,"I purchased this toy for my son after reading all the reviews about how great the suction is. But it turns out, its not true in my case. The suction easily comes off when my son pulls it. Much worse he puts it on the floor immediately. Its only matter of time before this thing falls apart... So disappointed!!",2
2385,"This wheel keeps my little one entertained for a long while. Unfortunately the grip on the suction cup does not hold very well. We have to hold it in order for baby to play with it which totally defeats the purpose of keeping baby entertained by himself.",3
2386,"This was a great little toy to put on my sons high chair when he was little and now that he's a little older we suction the wheel onto the refrigerator for him to play with which he loves and sometimes we even stick it in the tub right under the water so it spins while the tub fills up. Very simple toy but very fun.",5
2387,"My son is quite amused by this.  He likes to spin the different parts, and also likes to rattle the hoops on the bottom.  I had a problem with keeping it suctioned, but I just lick the suction cup now before I stick it down and it stays.  :-P",4
2388,"My so loves this but the reason we bought it was for use on his high chair tray (we have a boon flair) & when were out at restaurants as we've grown weary of retrieving toys from germy restaurant floors and cleaning them only to repeat the process again & again. My 8 month old son pulled it off and started chomping on the suction cup within moments of trying it out. I cannot get this you to stick to anything other than my granite counter top!",3
2389,"I bought this toy for my little grandson. He has an Evenflo exersaucer, and I was hoping this toy might somehow stick to it, but it doesn't. I knew it was a long shot, so I can't complain about that. In any case, when my daughter holds the toy for the baby, he really likes it a lot! It spins in so many different ways. He's crazy about it!",4
2390,"Baby is 4 months and loves this toy. He stares at it and laughs. He recently started spinning it himself and will play with it for a while before his nap. Great toy.",5
2391,"My little one ADORES this toy. It keeps her entertained for literal hours. But today, after it got covered in food, I washed it in the sink instead of with the wipes I had been using. It now has water on the inside of the wheel, which keeps the little beads from moving and making the sound that makes her so happy. I'm super bummed, as it never occurred to me that a kid's toy wouldn't be washable, at least under the faucet. I've set it aside in the hopes that it will dry...but I'm disappointed.",2
2392,"I bought these because my baby has Down syndrome and I wanted him to learn to be more aware of this body and to build muscle tone by lifting his arms. While he likes to lift his hands to look at them, I think the rattles tend to confuse him. They're definitely cute and will probably work for a typical baby, but they just didn't work for mine. Also, since styles may vary, I did take the risk of possibly getting the pink hippo for my little boy, and that's exactly what happened.",3
2393,"My son loves playing with them specially the one that makes rattle noise. They are small and can easily fit into the diaper bag.",5
2394,"Once my kid figured out what these (balls) are he enjoys two of three very much. He's not a fan of the rattly, plastic one but I am not either. It's way to hard and too loud on the wood floors. The blue one is a soft plastic with weird groove that makes it roll in different directions and the clown colored soft ball is great for passing back and forth. They are about 5&#34; in diameter. Overall its a good buy.",4
2395,"Not so fun for my 7month old, for some reason she has not pay too much attention to this specific toy",2
2396,"That's the problem with baby toys is that we saw another friend's baby love this toy and we thought our 8 month old would enjoy it also but of course he didn't really like it. It's actually pretty funny our baby doesn't really like it but other babies that come over to visit love it. The toy seems like it would be enjoyable in that it is colorful and soft so the baby can chew on it or throw it around. Unfortunately our baby just didn't take to this toy but I've seen other babies love it.",4
2397,"I bought this thermometer for routine temp checks on my husband after he had major knee surgery. The hospital sent us home with some adhesive crystalized thermometer strips to stick on his temple and those things are very accurate. Husband's temp kept dropping down to 95 degrees, then jumping up to 101/102 within a few hours. I began using the SantaMedical infrared just to compare readings and it was giving the same readings as the hospital strips. Husband went back into the ER a few days after surgery and his temperature there was the same as the readings I'd gotten at home with the SantaMedical. At that point, I figured it was pretty accurate. Now that husband is all better, I've started using this thermometer on my toddler son and it's much more accurate than any other thermometer, especially the Braun thermoscan I bought for him which is always wrong. The only thing I don't like about this thermometer is that it can be hard to get a good reading if there is a lot of hair on a person's head, near the temple. My son has a thick mane of hair and it's hard to find a good patch of skin on his temple where the hair won't interfere with the reading.",4
2398,"After using this thermometer for a few months, we got a temporal one instead. This one just isn't consistent. Sometimes that's ok, but if it's a difference of 3 degrees in an one year old, it needs to be accurate.",1
2399,"Here are the things I like about this stroller:* Very light weight* Easy to open and close* Storage accommodates my medium sized diaper bag* My almost two year daughter is comfortable in the stroller; she likes to sit upright, and she can definitely see out in this stroller.* Has cupholder* Easy to wheel while on pavementDislikes:* Hard to wheel on non-pavement.  I tried pushing this stroller on a gravel road and it was nearly impossible with my daughter in the stroller.  She weighs 27 pounds.  It was easy to push without her in the stroller, so a lighter child would help.  I know that this stroller is an umbrella stroller and not meant for &#34;off road&#34;, but I thought I would mention it.",4
2400,"We love our stroller.  I looked at all the different umbrella strollers on the market and decided to splurge on this one and it is soo worth it!  It is durable, yet light.  We take it everywhere.  I would have bought 5 of the cheapy versions by now.And as a sidenote, my husband ran over one of the wheels and uppababy sent us a replacement quickly for only $10.",5
2401,"These didn't stick to anything. I even added my own sticky tape when the original failed, but that didn't work, either. My toddler son pulls them off with ease, so now they're laying around the house, useless. Disappointed!",1
2402,"Works perfectly on our sliding glass door.  We were looking for something that could be placed high enough out of reach that our two year old couldn't get outside. The only complaint is the adhesive that it comes with is complete garbage. Try a 3M adhesive or a mirror mounting adhesive square found at your local hardware store, just don't expect their included adhesive to do a lot of adhering.",4
2403,"I've tried everything to get this item to work and it doesn't. At least not on mirrored sliding closet doors. This product and the company is very frustrating and disappointing.",1
2404,"Bought one for myself and one for a shower gift for my sister in law. Such a great idea, case is sturdy and large enough that you can add a few items of your own choice.",5
2405,"We have never had any problems with this monitor. I love how big the display is and the fact that I can talk to my kids (ahem, tell them to lay down) and move it to view all the kids in the room!",5
2406,"I've been using this monitor for two years and I absolutely love it. The video is good quality, enough to serve its purpose anyway but there might be clearer videos out there. The range is decent. I can work out in the yard while my son is sleeping and still get a signal. The audio quality is great and I love the talk feature. I read reviews about the talk button being a problem with it being next to the power button but this has never been an issue for me.The monitor was recommended to me by another mom who has been using it for about 4 - 5 years now and it's still going strong.I have recommended this monitor to others. Having a video, rather than just audio, makes all the difference in the world.",5
2407,"My child clearly isn't ready for fast but slow seems to slow.  Love that they have an inbetween nipple.  One thing to note is they may turn yellowish brown if you put them in the dishwasher, so I would avoid using a dishwasher with these nipples.",5
2408,"I purchased these for cloth diapering (which we haven't started yet) but found they were really awesome for postpartum personal care. They are very soft and gentle, stay fairly warm if moistened with warm water, and there are zero stains on them even after having been used and let sit for a day before any rinsing!I also use them as smaller spit up rags around the house and as pee shields on my baby boy between taking one diaper off and getting the next one on. They've been well christened a time or two and have really absorbed and held all my son has thrown at it. I think they will be very useful as boosters in cloth diapers if we need them.",5
2409,"I bought this because my 10 months old are starting to open up cabinet doors and drawers. I tried using this to keep them closed but it has failed on me. I even tried putting them on differently thinking maybe I just did them wrong. But nope. Nothing worked. I got so frustrated that I wanted to just throw them away.First, it was very hard to get it to close tightly so the doors don't open up. Even after I have almost broke my fingers off trying to close it to as tightly as possible. The doors would still open up. That was no good because my daughter can end up closing the doors on her fingers and hurt herself. Aside from that, it was VERY hard to open/close this. To pull it close was kind of easy but to open them back up was hard. There is a small button on the side to press and at the same time, you have to push the little button up in order to release and allow you to pull it open.I don't have fat fingers. I actually have tiny hands and I found that to be very hard to do. It's a positive thing because that means LO won't be able to open up the lock herself. But, it was PAINFUL for me to open it. When I was trying to lock up the doors it was so hard for me.I tried any possible ways to do it so that it wouldn't be hard and close the doors tightly. Nothing worked.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I might give these a try in the future maybe...But for now they're just stored away. Eventually it might even become garbage.",1
2410,"We live in a cul de sac where cars cannot always see the kids playing. I love how this alerts them that they are outside. I took one star because it does not serve as a storage. It doesn't stay up when you add stuff inside and you can't really carry around withy stuff inside. It looks like it's going to tear. But as an alert sign is great. On windy days I just add a rock to the inside and it stays in place.",4
2411,"I love that this is lightweight and the zipper storage (we store our outdoor rugs in it and it keeps it from blowing away) A car backed over it and it still works just the same! :) Best part is that YOU CANT MISS IT! Very bright!",5
2412,"These things wear out so fast for some reason- so this is absolutely a must buy, and it's a great deal!",5
2413,"Very cute and realky ties the nursery together.  I had an issue finding the opening in the fabric to hang the actual mobile part, but its actually in the giraffe's mouth. It doesnt play very long. Cute decor, but not the best mobile for practical purposes since doesn't even play long enough for my to change my other twins diaper and clothes. But I mostly got it for decor.",4
2414,"Before my wife went back to work, we tried Medela, Avent, and Tommy Tippie bottles for our breastfed baby.  She didn't like any of them.  I had never heard of this Comotomo brand, but I ordered one based on the excellent reviews.  Thankfully our baby took quickly to this bottle, and now loves it.They are very expensive for baby bottles, but for us it is worth it since she loves drinking from them.",5
2415,"I bought this bottle on whim, simply because I love the Comotomo teething toy so much, I wanted to support the company. I ended up finding my favorite bottle we've ever purchased! My baby had colic severely, and was using the Dr. Brown bottles, which are certainly good for helping with colic, but they are an absolute PAIN to clean. My baby was 6 months when I bought this bottle, and he immediately took to it. The wide nipple base allows them to get a really good latch, and the air vents definitely help prevent excess air ingestion. The soft bottle allows baby to hold it easily. But by far, my favorite part about the bottle is how easy it is to clean. I can just use our normal dish brush and quickly clean both the nipple and the bottle, rather than fiddle with the dumb bottle brush that always flicks suds everywhere. I only purchased one bottle, and we actually tear up the house trying to find it, rather than use our other bottles. I think the only downfall is the price, but for me, I'm willing to pay for their ease of use.",5
2416,"I had supply issues so I postponed introducing a bottle until 8 weeks and was very nervous (afraid she wouldn't take to it or that she would and it might affect her latch).  We had zero problems using these bottles.  She gave my husband a very dirty look, but easily took the bottle, getting a nice deep latch.  She has since (now 6 mos.) had no trouble going back and forth from bottle to boob. The 5 oz. bottles have a newborn flow - since we're still nursing, we'll stick with that.  Also the fill lines on the side are now embossed (raised) rather than printed. If you're looking for glass alternatives, fwiw, my girl also takes happily to the Phillips Avent glass bottles.  We take Comotomo to daycare and use glass at home.",5
2417,"These bottles were great for getting a breastfeed infant started on a bottle. We had several different bottles in stock, and this is the bottle our infant preferred. Unfortunately after a few months the bottles quit venting. So I bought two more and neither one of them vented brand new. I called the company and got no response so I returned the bottles and I guess we will be trying something else.",2
2418,"THis booster seat attaches to another chair or can be used stand alone. You can fold it up and use it when traveling which is a great feature. It does not take up a lot of space when its folded and its very simple to put back together. Its very easy to clean and it does not stain with messy things as spaghetti sauce. The only thing that Im not crazy about is the straps to tie your kid in do not come off. There is no way to really wash them and if you have ever feed an infant thats learning to eat or an extremely messy two year old before your will already know that food gets everywhere!!! What I have done in the past is wiped down the straps with antibacterial wipes as much as possible at least to clean off any food particles and stickyness that might have gotten on it. All inall its a good product for the price",3
2419,"This is a great booster seat to take when you travel as a high chair. Could also use as home as a high chair. Great product!",5
2420,"I have the Nuby bottle from my now 5-year-old, and they fit those, but I bought more bottles for my 1-year-old, and the nipples are different.",5
2421,"I really like the Grovia soaker pads for several reasons. They are so simple to use and slim yet still have amazing absorption. They do take a while to dry. If I place them in the dryer they usually have to go through several cycles to get dry and if I'm sunning them to dry they can be out from sun up to sun down and still not dry.",5
2422,"I have only been using the gate for a couple weeks so I am not sure about the long time usage. But this gate looks pretty amazing in my stairs that are built of steal and cherry wood. They were easy to install. I used the pressure method and it felt safe enough for me to decide not to use screws.",5
2423,"This is a great gate.  We have 2 so far and plan to get more, one to block off the kitchen and another at the top of the stair, our 10 month old shakes it hard and it stays sturdy.  Be aware you WILL need the 5 inch extension with it.  The actual gate is very narrow, we have a small town home with what I concider small hallways and we still needed the extension in both cases, using the extension will make the gate more sturdy anyway.",5
2424,"After a few tries, installation came together and it works quite well in the tension mount position. Do note, however, that it will likely rub the paint off underneath.",4
2425,"About the same time our toddler learned how to scale shorter gates, so did our St. Bernard. This gate keeps both of them out of the kitchen. The only thing I would change about it is to make it an auto close gate. We have a second extra tall gate by a different manufacturer that is an auto close gate and it is awesome.",5
2426,"These are very thin, and the neck is very large.  Not suitable for younger infants, probably best for toddler ages",3
2427,"I bought these for daycare, too. Easy for feedings, bleach them or throw them away.  Controls of drooling and teething!  I also bought two orders of these!",5
2428,"At first use these are lovely, but not worth the money at all!  They will not hold up.  I have many diapers and have used cloth for all 3 of my kids.  I have Fuzzi Bunz I bought 10 years ago and they are still in great shape.  These Rumparooz didn't last me 2 years.  What a shame!  Being the most expensive diaper I've purchased I expected to at least get a second round out of them.  I stored them for a year in a dark closet with all the rest of my diapers out of heat and extreme temperatures.  My Bum Genius and Blueberry diapers are in the best shape.  They held up beautifully and are fully usable for the next baby.  My older Fuzzi Bunz are also in great shape and fully functioning.  My newer one size Fuzzi Bunz have shot elastic, but I am okay with this because I can replace the elastic fairly easily with the new button adjustments and for a decent price.  So they will serve me for many babies or be worth reselling.  I have covers that have held up well for multiple babies and I love the Motherease fitteds.  If you want a diaper that will last please consider another brand.",1
2429,"It is a cute diaper but there is such a large mass between the legs. However, the inserts hold A LOT. So that is a trade off with the bulk between the legs. The plaid pattern is adorable.",3
2430,"I bought this to replace my heavy, cumbersome Graco Fast Action jogger and it lives up to its reputation. It is so light and easy to push. The fixed wheel takes a bit of getting used to for turns, but it really does make it so much easier to push on rough surface trails. With my previous jogger, the unfixed wheel kept getting stuck on ruts and rocks and it was really frustrating. I use this on grass, dirt, mulch, and large/crushed gravel trails and it is great on all of them. Although much more compact than cheaper joggers, it's still pretty big so I only use it for running or walking on trails. I'd never use it as a multi-purpose stroller and have a cheap Graco one for the zoo, malls, and walking on paved surfaces.My only regret is that I wish the seat-back sat up more. My daughter likes to sit up and look around and she sometimes gets frustrated having to recline even at the most upright setting. I strongly suggest also getting the sun-shield for people who live in sunny climates as it has been a life saver. Best baby purchase by far, I use it every day.",5
2431,"Love this stroller! Great handling. Easy to run with. This one was cheaper than an earlier model that someone on Craigslist was selling 2nd hand.",5
2432,"This is a very smooth ride, but it's super bulky and heavy when taking it in and out of the car.  When car shopping, we brought it with us to make sure it would fit in the trunk of whatever we purchased.  We looked at several small SUVs and it had to go in sideways in all of them in order to fit.  We ended up with a Prius V and it barely fits without going sideways.  The store is limited as well.  The bottom carriage is shallow and the seat above dips down making it super hard to get things in and out.  It's good for running but the alignment can get off easily so it pulls to one side.  Overall, I wouldn't buy it again, although the brand is well known and it's safe at least.",3
2433,"We love our Bob.  It folds up nicely and fits in the trunk of my little 3 series BMW sedan.  I only wish they were cheaper, but at least amazon sells them for a much lower price than Babies R Us.  They roll very easily and the sun screen covers my daughter very well.  It is pretty easy to jog with...you can make the front wheel be fixed it you like that option.  I take my Bob every where.  It is our only stroller and I am so glad we have it.",5
2434,"This was a gift to our daughter and husband, for their soon-to-be-born baby boy.Our daughter researched strollers and spoke with friends who already owned one, and this BOB won out over other brands.She is a runner (has been for 18 years) and is looking forward to using this stroller within her neighborhood.Amazon had the best price over all the other sites that I explored.",5
2435,"I LOVE MY BOB STROLLER!!!!! I was really contemplating buying another brand because of the price, but I am so glad that I didn't. In this case it was true that you get what you pay for. This stoller is top of the line. It's a smooth ride for my baby and is so easy to push when I am running or just out for a walk. It's not very heavy, so I'm able to load it in my car no problem. My only complaint is that you have to order the &#34;extra&#34; stuff, such as a cup holder, but overall I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I have had several family members comment on how smooth it is. Friends of ours who have other jogging strollers have complained about theirs and said they regretted not getting a BOB, but friends who have the BOB all love theirs!",5
2436,"I purchased this for my wife for her power walks in the mornings and she loves it.  It's super easy to push and turns on a dime.  It is quite large and heavy (~30 lbs) and awkward to put in and out of the car.  But...it is by far the best stroller we have owned.",5
2437,"It really depends on why you need this stroller. Ill start off by saying I have 5 strollers and 2 kids (4 months and 3.5 years). We spend half the year in Europe and there we have the Bugaboo Chameleon (great for city living but not practical for suburbs) and the Baby Jogger City Mini GT for traveling to other countries. We used the Maclaren quest for a while but found that the cobblestone and uneven grounds in Europe made it tough for our daughter to sleep so now the Maclaren just stays in the trunk for quick grocery runs. We also have the Bob Ironman for running for when we are in the States. My husband and I run on average of 15-30 miles a week on paved roads and trails and we love the Bob. Problem now is we have two children.  My daughter is old enough where we don't need a double for everyday as we have the buggy board for the Bugaboo and that works fine. HOWEVER we are very active and we got tired of taking turns running with one child while the other waits. My daughter can't run mileage of course and even trail runs /walks are too strenuous for a toddler to walk. We needed a double for this reason. Locally we don't have these strollers so I ordered both. I love both my Baby jogger City mini GT and Bob Ironman so I wasn't sure if the Summit Double or Bob Double is what I needed. Brief comparison1- I like the canopy on the Baby Jogger better than the Bob. It's the same coverage just sturdier.2- the foot rest on the summit is really short. My daughters feet were dangling off the side bc she simply didn't know where to put them3- the Bob tends to sag in the middle when both children are inside. Not the seat portion but the backrest. This was not an issue on the Baby Jogger.4- the baby jogger is really short length wise. It makes it great for turns but I was worried if I took it on hills or trail runs that it would tip backwards. The Bob is much longer (and slimmer BTW) which also gives my daughter a place to rest her feet.5- handbrake. I really wanted one since I'm used to my ironman. The Baby Jogger has it and the Bob does not (even though Bob is coming out with a double in July 2014 with an adjustable handle and handbrake but I needed the stroller ASAP and couldn't wait).Long story short - we returned the summit and kept the Bob. The only reason why I'm not giving this a five star rating is because I miss having a handbrake. For running, I needed the durability and ruggedness of the Bob. I never write reviews but I figured perhaps this can help someone with the same criteria as I did without having to return one stroller back for $80. Arghhhhhhh",4
2438,"Love this thing. It is super light, maneuvers easily, I wish that we could use it exclusively (it is a bit big to take into stores, etc). Definitely worth the money!",5
2439,"So I have to admit that I had stroller envy before biting the bullet and buying this. I would stare longingly at other moms at the mall and zoo who had this beast of a stroller, usually wiping some drool off my chin. I finally talked my husband into buying this (sidenote: it cost more than his junker commuter car, so we joke about that) for mother's day/a birthday gift. Seriously I wish I could ride in it, but I don't think my 3.5 year old would do a great job steering.When I received it, the foam padding on the bar under the brake was torn but I don't even care. It isn't a big tear, and I'm sure it would happen eventually anyway. The right back tire also always goes flat. I am bringing the tires into Les Schuab to have them filled with some sort of goo foam so they don't go flat....ever. Or at least that is the claim!We have only used this for walks and and to the zoo, so I have no experience bringing it into close quarter spaces.I do wish it came with the handlebar console, but whatevs, whats $20something more when you're already spending the money to buy this.",5
2440,"We were so ecstatic to find out that my inlaws purchased this for us to use for our kiddos. One is fourteen months and he will be seventeen months when the new baby arrives. I love this stroller and am excited to use it to get back into shape after baby is born and my husband can use it to involve our little ones in staying fit for the marine corps",5
2441,"Definitely a pricey stroller, but great quality, easy to use, super smooth ride both walking and jogging, not too heavy (given the size), the kids love it!",5
2442,"After reading good reviews I decided to invest in these scissors for our newborn. We already had clippers but they make me nervous that I will clip her fingertips. These is no anxiety when using these scissors becuase you have a much better sense where you are clipping and it is much faster than the clippers. A no-brainer investment because babies constantly need their nails clipped.",5
2443,"Lovely little Nail scissors. You definitely need these. Just know that merely cutting your baby's nails won't stop her from scratching herself. You need to soften the edges with an emery board.",5
2444,"I used this one because I was too scared to use the nail clippers the hospital gave me. For the first couple of weeks it was fine but once I tried the nail clippers I realized that it was just much easier with the nail clippers. You should try using the nail clippers first and then buy the scissors if you feel you still need it",2
2445,"I used the Zo-li buzz nail trimmer for the first few months of my baby's life (an battery operated nail file trimmer).  Then I noticed it took forever to get my little one's nails filed.  I finally ordered these baby scissors based on all of the high reviews.  I'm very happy that I did - the scissors have a round edge, instead of sharp ends of adult nail scissors, which helps reduce the chances of cutting your baby's skin.  I am now able to cut my baby's nails very quickly, and will use the nail file to smooth out any edges.  The scissors also come with a small case to cover the cutting portion when not in  use.",5
2446,"I have a full newborn kit with traditional clippers in it. I can't seem to get as close a cut with those and I do with scissors. The scissors have more control in shaping my newborn's sharp claws. I can get such a precision cut with these scissors that I don't need to cut as often after using these",5
2447,"I don't know how I would have cut my son's nails without these!  For any new parent thinking little scissors are weird for cutting a baby's finger nails, don't worry, these are great.  They make it hard to hurt them, and they can cut the nails so easily and safely, and they are very easy to hold.  They come with a nice little case to slide over them, and the tips of the scissors are rounded.  I highly recommend these.",5
2448,"These have been amazing!  Other moms in my mommy group show up with their babies fingers all bandaged up cause they nipped them but not us!  These are so easy to use and make me very confident when I cut baby's nails.  Never hurt him and it is super quick.  I just get him when he is sleeping and he never knows.",5
2449,"Bought this at Kohl's during their Black Friday sale to give to my toddler for Christmas.  He's obsessed with it because he thinks he's &#34;super frog&#34; but after very little use and maybe two washes it started unraveling.  It also continued shedding after the first wash.  For what I paid on Black Friday, I won't complain much.  I wouldn't pay $26 (what it's currently listed at) for it--ever.",3
2450,"This is my son's favorite food pouch.  He really likes to squish the silicone body of the pouch and I love how easy it is to clean.",5
2451,"Around about the time my child transitioned to sippy cups I realized I wanted him to learn how to drink from a straw. Sometimes as a frazzled parent you forget a few things, including the sippy cup and most restaurants can give you a take away cup with a lid and straw but it really doesn't help unless your child understands how to use the straw. I think my 9 month old learned how to drink from this cup in 5 minutes. The benefit of this trainer is that it is &#34;slightly&#34; squeezable which allows the parent to hold the straw to the child's mouth and squeeze a bit to teach the child to suck from the straw for more liquid. This cup has a sliding lid which folds the straw down and closes the cup completely to prevent the straw from getting dirty or from the cup leaking when you are on the go. The only downside in my opinion is that if there is liquid in the straw and the cup gets warm, when you slide open the lid which pops the straw up, liquid drink flicks in your eye, on the wall, on your clothes, wherever. If you learn to open it slowly and carefully you can avoid this problem and since we mostly just give our child water it never really bothers me. I highly recommend this cup and it is *almost* spill proof unless your child turns it upside down and beats it on the table... even then its just a bit of liquid.",5
2452,"I bought this product because my baby tends to get very hot easily in the car seat, even thought we blast the A/C for him. This car seat/stroller liner seems to help keep him a little cooler and wicks away sweat. I recommend this product. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars intead of 5 is because my baby still gets a sweaty back when I pull him out of the car seat. But I'd rather have this liner than not have one at all (in fact, I bought 2 more after I bought this one).",4

2455,"First off, I find it extremely concerning that the success of my pumping efforts and ability to feed my infant while at work teeters uncertainly on the point of a pair of tiny, fragile, and insanely expensive plastic valves.  Like many, my Ameda pump was insurance-issued and I had no choice of pump.  With a brand new set of valves, my pump performs great.  I baby my valves, removing them with a.spoon per my Ameda customer service representative's instructions, carefully washing, and air drying them on a towel. Despite my efforts, these spendy little nuggets go downhill fast. I swear, all you need to do is look at them wrong and they instantly develop microscopic tears.  Within a week or two, my pump suction begins to suffer, as does my husband as he deals with my pump-induced frustration and mounting rage. It seems like every mom I talk to has some issue with their pump, regardless of brand.  I will say that I had great experience with the Ameda customer support staff, even receiving a replacement motor early on when mine crapped out.  Yes, it was great to get a free pump through insurance, but being locked into the constant valve replacement is not-so-great.  But, here we are!",3
2456,"EVERY household with young children should have at least one of these. My older daughter is constantly slamming doors to keep her little brother out, and this makes it impossible for her to slam his little fingers. I mainly use it on one door in particular, but when we're in another room and I'm concerned, I move it to that door. (We have a small house, so rotating it isn't an issue - otherwise I'd order more!).This is well-made and does exactly what it claims. And another note: I also use this is a semi door &#34;lock&#34;. I don't want to lock my kids out, but if I want some privacy while still keeping my door cracked to hear them (say, in the night), I just put this up at the top of the door where they can't reach it. So my door is &#34;locked&#34; without having to literally shut my kids out. If they call me, or come to the door to get me, I can easily hear them. Fantastic.",5
2457,"First experience with this. It is a great invention, and works perfectly. Wish the price was a little lower, but it is worth protecting our son's fingers.",5
2458,"I desperately wish that this allowed you to close the door but understood that it did not when I bought it so I will not hold that against the product. I did ding it one star though because it does appear flimsy. It holds, and holds tight, but I can't get over the fact it looks like it will snap in two with just a little bit of force. That's it for the negative, price not withstanding, everything else about this product is exactly as advertised and completely lived up to our expectations. It holds on door jams that a similar higher speed and higher priced product failed on. It is super easy to use and ridiculously easy to move frome door to door if needed. It might not work against an older/stronger child but it definitely works for our 2 yr old, and he is not gentle with doors. Overall, very pleased. This is our go to lock to quickly secure a door when we need to.",4
2459,"With two small kids, one actively crawling and other actively searching for any sugary snacks, Door Monkey is a lifesaver.I purchased two and we constantly move them around wherever needed. No installation is a BIG BIG plus and what's most important IT WORKS!. No little fingers getting pinched and no little fingers getting into any of the snack jars. I highly recommend it to any parent.",5
2460,"This is a great product - easy to open and close, holds the door open just enough for ventilation, but not wide enough for the little &#34;housetrained&#34; Chihuahua to sneak in.HOWEVER, if your house is older, like ours, the jam or door thickness may not be a standard size. While the Door Monkey would fit onto our door, the tail would not quite go far enough to &#34;latch&#34; onto the door jam. Curses! Of the five doors I need one of these on, it would only work with one.It would be nice if the specifications mentioned the allowable sizes of doors and jams for this to work correctly.",4
2461,"I was nervous to purchase any kind of child-proof door device because let's face it, sometimes child proof devices can be adult proof too until they get figured out. The door monkey was so simple to install. No permanent holes in my doors or walls and it's idiot proof in regards to operation. I was so pleased that I ordered 2 more for other rooms.",5
2462,"Our door jambs didn't have a definite squared edge for the monkey clips to latch to so I had to return. Good concept",3
2463,"Seriously clever invention. The BEST way to keep children and pets from opening doors you don't want them to open. Easy to put on and use, super portable, sturdy. Super strong toddler son cannot open the door when this is on, and even getting his step stool he can't reach it. Later we can put it lower so that he can open it but keep the baby out from the bathroom for example. Thank you to the people who invented this thing.",5
2464,"This works great!  I love that it allows the door to be cracked a bit.  Easy to put on and take off as an adult.",5
2465,"We have handles instead of doorknobs so these are the perfect item to keep my son where he is supposed to be.  I also love that I can easily take it off and use it in multiple rooms.  I've even brought them with me when we travel.",5
2466,"I have no idea if these work, but they're cute! As a parent I will try anything to help ease my sons teething pain. I definitely think Motrin works better than Amber, but who knows... Maybe they work! We leave ours on 24/7, except for baths, without any issue.",5
2467,"It's cute as a necklace or wrap around ankle bracelet.  I do not know if it helps my little one with teething or not.  But it doesn't hurt to think it does!",4
2468,"Love this crib, my statement above says it all. Light, beautiful color, easy to put together and not bulky like other cribs. Great price too",5
2469,"It's a great mattress, my mom owns one for the grandkids going on 4th year and 8th grandchild to sleep in it. Ours seems to have a little indent in the middle from where he sleeps on it (and he's only 15 lbs, so it's not that he's an overly large baby or anything). I don't think it's a problem though.",4
2470,"The bag is a nice size and fits all of my daughter's tub toys. Seems pretty sturdy and I like the fact that it's washable. We've only had it a couple weeks now, but it has fallen off the wall several times, which is annoying. I compared it to another suction basket we have that came with a tub toy and realized that these suctions cups are smaller. I think having bigger suction cups would make greatly improve the product.",3
2471,"My toddler's amount of bath toys were getting out of hand, and we needed more storage space for them.  I have no problems with the suction cups coming off or sliding around on the shower wall, and it offers plenty of space.  It is kind of cheap though, and it's hard for my daughter to get her toys in and out of because it's so flimsy.  The gaps between the strings are pretty big, meaning toys get stuck in the netting easily, which anyone with a 2 year old knows can cause a screaming fit!  It will do for now though, but I would pick something nicer the next time.",3
2472,"I haven't yet washed these rail covers so I don't know how they will hold up after but so far, they are nice.  They are soft, nicely padded and attach very easily.  I have a sleighbed style crib for my son and finding a rail cover that was wide enough was hard.  These tie on the outside and the ties are short so I am not worried about a choking hazard.  They also hold securely, I had to untie one of the straps and I had a difficult time doing it, I just used a standard single knot.  Nice rich color, my son loves to run his little hands across it too, lets hope he doesn't start chewing on it!",5
2473,"I like the versatility of this travel potty. I wish it were slightly taller (I have a very tall 2 year old-37&#34; girl) and it isn't very easy for her to use this as the stand alone potty. However, she does like it as the fold out seat that sits on a large potty. Feels very secure on the toilet. I think in a pinch we could get the potty to work as a standalone but for now she simply tells me &#34;no like it&#34; when I set it up for her. She happily uses it on the big toilet though.",5
2474,"I keep this potty chair in my car for those times when you just can't run into a bathroom.  Especially since I have a baby, having to unload him and then wrangle my other kids in a gross public bathroom isn't the most ideal situation.I actually owned the potty for a few months before actually needing to use it.  My family and I were on a long road trip and out in the middle of nowhere and my son said he had to go really really bad.  And his stomach hurt.  So this wasn't a situation where we could just pull over quickly, and get it taken care of.  We unfolded the seat, loaded it with one of the awesome bags it came with and he was able to take care of business!  Such a life saver!",5
2475,"I expected this to be a bracelet or necklace for me to wear not for a baby to wear.",2
2476,"My husband installed one of these on a kitchen cabinet, and when locked, the door can still be opened by our one year old. At first we figured it was our mistake, but after much tweaking, it seems that there is no way these can work on our cabinets.",1
2477,"These locks work well and they're super secure. Unless your toddler can rig up a reasonably strong electromagnet. But then you've got bigger problems. The locks can be set to stay open if the kids aren't around and you need easier access. The magnetic key works fairly well.Installation isn't the easiest, and the paper template could be better. I had some cabinets where I just couldn't mount these locks and had to find alternatives. Still, as long as you can keep the key out of reach, these are about secure as toddler locks get.",4
2478,"was in need to baby proof, got almost everything I needed from this kit.  we have a lot of outlets around the house, and we still have extras :)",5
2479,"I love this locking system.  It's easy for adults to use, but kids can't figure it out.  The locks don't allow doors to open at all so little fingers don't accidentally get shut in them like with hook closures.",5
2480,"The pair worked great for a year. Now neither will turn on automatically, I have to leave them on 24/7.",2
2481,"This is my second Infantino carrier and I think it's great for the price and comfort.  My baby who is 7 weeks feel right asleep.  I've read a few articles about having baby, while still developing, be set in their carriers in an ergo friendly position, so they don't develop his displaysia.I think this carrier will do the trick!",5
2482,"Works great! Snaps in nicely. Easy to use. And fits my chicco keyfit perfectly! No complaints! Great Product. I was a bit surprised by the straps that need to get attached but I guess any added safety is nice.",5
2483,"I, like every other parent, have been through every single sippy cup on the market.  At 16 months, my girl still couldn't figure out how to suck on a straw cup (She was able to suck food out of the Plum food pouches however).  So I started thinking maybe it isn't so much that she didn't know how to suck, as maybe she had to do it too hard on the straw.  Well if you want leak proof, there has to be a valve.  I tried her various cups (Munchkin, Playtex, Dr Brown) and geez, it was hard to get a full gulp out, no wonder she kept giving up.Finally, I caved in to google searches and got the Lollacup.  No valve means that your LO can skip as easily as you can every straw (note, that means that a lot more liquid will get in their mouths - they should be old enough to know how to regulate flow.  I wouldn't necessarily start with first sippy being a Lollacup).  At first my girl made funny faces, cause she had a mouth full of water and QUICK!  She started drooling/spitting it out all over her.  But within a few days, she got the hang of it and can drink half the cup relatively quickly with no issues.Is it leak proof?  No way.  Well, when the lid is closed, yes.  But when it's open and your toddler flips it upside down, or drops it, drops/puddle will be on your floor.  I'm a little hesitant giving this cup in a carseat, for fear that I'll have a wet seat at the end of the ride.  For rides in the car, we use the Wow cup, which is very leakproof, and no straw/valve.If your baby/toddler has been having a hard time with straw cups, I'd definitely recommend this sippy, as its the only one my daughter could figure out the straw feature.  I'll worry about leaks later!",5
2484,"Small bowl, good for new eaters, scrapes gently. Stains easily tho, carrots turned it kinda yellow, doesn't effect functionality. Handle is ok, light thin, easy to hold plastic. I don't like the connector. It's not supposed to be taken apart. But I guess it could be. Haven't tried. Don't like it bc it seems like it would trap germs.",4
2485,"We loved this tub. We bought this when my daughrer was old enough to sit in a tub like this and all the way up until she was 18 months. She loved all the sesame street characters.",5
2486,"Fits snug in the tub, so it won't wiggle around.  However, it is a little tough to fill up because the faucet in the bathtub runs on the edge of the tub and you lose lots of the water unless you stand there and actually push the side flat against the tub to fill it.The water indicators don't really work, but that's not much of a surprise and we don't really use the shampoo holders.  However, it is soft and provides a place for a little one to sit and if they happen to slide to the side, there is a soft cushion to catch them.",4
2487,"This worked great for our daughter to stay snug and safe in the tube until she got sturdy on her feet. She also loved riding around on it on the carpet (An unintended toy, but I'm happy to have dual purpose baby items).",5
2488,"I have a 13 month old that is all over the place in the tub and isn't very sure footed in it. It's not that I fill up the tub with too much water or anything but she get's uneasy and scared in the water. This inflatable tub is perfect, fits well in the tub and she is able to play in the water more to get used to it. Before this I tried giving her a bath in the sink but that only freaked her out more so this was the perfect solution. My one regret is that I didn't buy this sooner. There is a review that says there is a drawback with this tub not having a plug at the bottom and when you pull the tub up to empty it that it may tear the seams. I didn't think to much of it but when I first went to lift it to empty it I could see where she was coming from. The solution is to just put your arms under it and tip it over to get the water out that way. Great great product, baby loves it, was adorable watching her play in the water finally!",5
2489,"This works great for saving water in the huge bathtub. The cup holders are nice and its a good size. But the blow up back cushion is kind of silly, and just holds in water to grow mold. Mold and mildew will cause this tub to go in the trash quickly, bummer!",3

2491,"I ordered this to use on walks with my baby to shield her from the sun.  I have an Uppababy Mesa car seat and it works perfectly (although I see how it would work well with almost any infant car seat). It comes folded up in a zippered pouch/carrier.  It pops open and fits over the top of the carrier.  The top and sides are a breathable mesh that is perfect for blocking out bugs.  The top portion also has a sunshade that is in a zippered pouch (connected to the seat shade) that can be pulled out and snapped down to the carrier to block the sun.  This is perfect for blocking the sun, however there is no sun shield for the sides, so the sun still hits my daughter's legs.  I would give it five stars if it fully blocked the sun.",4
2492,"My son, who is now 22 mo., has been wearing these since he was born.  I love the XL size since my son moves al lover his crib at night.  We are just now beginning to sleep with a regular blanket since it is warmer, but I couldn't more highly recommend these.  Wonderful at any size.  I also believe these have kept him from trying to get out of his crib since he can't get a leg over.  He did sometimes unzip it, but it is better than sleeping with no covering.",5
2493,"My daughter loves this toy! Now that she's starting to sit it's even more fun because she can me more interactive with it. The only thing I don't understand is what's on top of the turtle head. But we love this toy.",5

2500,"After I did a lot of research on the best locks, these kept coming up (youtube, mommy blogs etc.)  These are great and easy to install.  We have cabinets like the picture and they still work great.  I installed them so our little one can't even open them the slighest.  I have our drawers locked with the Mommy Helper Safe-lok, which are great but they allow little fingers to slide in and possibly still be able to pull stuff out or even worse slam their fingers in the drawer.  These really are a better choice and if you can afford it - use these locks for all cabinets and drawers.  The package we bought has 8 in them and you can't find this deal anywhere else.  The magnet is super strong! They also sale extra magnets/openers just in case. Oh - another thing the locks can be turned off - which is a nice feature too.",5
2501,"I have installed 4 of these so far and they work great. Does require pre-drilling, but they provide a great system for aligning and marking holes. Did find an issue with our bathroom cabinets, since they doors shut flush with the frame, there is nothing to attach the &#34;catch&#34; too. I will be installing an additional piece of wood to hold the catch. That is the only difficulty so far. The latches and magnet work great.",5
2502,"IF your cabinet doors have sturdy wood grain that doesn't split easily.. rather than bothering with a time consuming drill, get some 1/2"" #6 wood screws with a sharper tapered tip than the ones provided.  Poke the template holes with an awl or knife tip rather than a pencil.  The wood screws will easily screw in by hand without requiring a pilot hole to be drilled.  This way I was able to install each one as fast as it takes to drive 4 screws by hand + another minute to put the sticky template in place.",5

2505,"We spent a month living in Amsterdam and wanted a stroller that would be compact, lightweight and agile. We wanted something that we could fold up quickly if we needed to hop on a bus and that we could lift with the baby inside of it if we needed to climb a flight of stairs. I narrowed it down to two choices that we &#34;test drove&#34; at the nearby baby outlets. We were debating between the Peg Perego Pliko Mini and the Mountain Buggy Nano. Both have great features that we needed for our trip overseas.Here's the link to the Mountain Buggy Nano:http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Buggy-Nano-Stroller-Ruby/dp/B00I3YFHRG/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid;=1398297779&sr;=8-8&keywords;=mountain+buggy+miniHere are the stats comparing the two:PPPM/MBNPrice-  $250/$200weight-  13lbs/13lbsFolded size-  37.5&#8221; x 13.5&#8221; x 13&#34; /22&#34; x 22 x 12.5Unfolded size  40.25&#8221; x 19.25&#8221; x 33.33&#8221; / 39x33x22Recline-  3 position clicks/strap lower like jogging strollerSunshade-  large and snaps off the back/attached to back smallerWeight capacity- 45lbs/44lbsShoulder strap- no/yesStands when folded yes/yes, kind of- some fabric might touch the floorOne handed fold yes/noAdjustable leg rest yes/yesOther features- Adjustable handle height/ Compatible with our carseat, has a scooter accessoryThere were a number of differences between the two strollers that made the choice hard though:-PPPM folded with one hand-MBN had a more compact fold- like a briefcase-PPPM easily stood up on its own when folded-MBN worked with basket car seats (so for future babies that would come in handy)-PPPM had a better canopy (sun shade)-MBN has a more comfortable harness strap for the child (the PPPM has a skinny crotch strap that rode up after a while)-PPPM has adjustable handles (although they still don't extend quite high enough for my 6'4&#34; hubby)-MBN was a brand name we loved because of our jogging stroller (Mountain Buggy Terrain- see my review for that)Summary- Either one of these strollers would have worked for us, but after test driving them with our 8 month old inside we went with the Pliko Mini. Our trip went splendidly and even though we didn't use the stroller as much as we thought we would (since the Becco Carrier was more convenient- see my review on that), we were happy with our choice. The kicker was the quick folding capabilities. It was SO easy to hold our little guy in one arm and collapse and pick up the stroller with the other hand. Super fast!Hope all this helps!",5
2506,"I researched umbrella strollers for weeks before finally settling on the Pilko Mini. When I received the stroller I fell in love with the neon print and easy, one handed, fold. The stroller definitely has a lot going for it, but it feels cheap and flimsy, and worst of all, the wheels SQEEK.... No... SQUEAL like crazy! And yes, they're noisy on your first trip out on the town! If I didn't know the price I would have honest to god guessed that this was a $50 stroller- not $250! C'mon peg, I can deal with the light and flimsy feel of the stroller, but fix the insanely noisy wheels STAT!",2

2508,"I bought this for my son which finally grew out of his car seat and I also bought a smaller car (Kia Soul)!  This is a nice compact seat that fits perfectly in the back-seems to be pretty durable and comfortable as well. Now I do not go on long trips with my car but for going to school and to the store its perfect!",5
2509,"My son loves his new seat. It gets the job done.  Cup holders are excellent and can be easily reached (my son loves to &#34;hide&#34; toys by putting them in the cup holder and pushing the cup holder back into the seat).  My main criticism is that when moving the seat to a different car, the back comes off fairly easily. This is not a problem when the seat stays in the car without moving it around, and does not affect its operation (it wouldn't be a hazard in the event of an accident).  When my son is old enough for a backless booster I will probably be happy that the back comes off so easily! :)",4
2510,"The pouch ended up being too narrow, even though my son is on the smaller side.  The Velcro wouldn't stay attached and he constantly broke out of the swaddle.  Didn't use it for more than a few days.",1
2511,"We were not sure about bumpers so many say no some are ok with them so we went ahead and got this bundle did not like how the bumpers fit loose in certain spots slide down and went under mattress, but the quilt was nice we used it as a play matt on the ground he loved the design and was very comfortable",2
2512,"The blanket is cute and immune to constant machine wash .It still looks new, after one year. The bumper is really bad. It does not hold in place and keeps coming off the bed. We have stopped using the bumper.",3
2513,"This thing looks lime green and, at first, I was terrified that it would clash with my soft wasabi/sage walls. It is totally not!!! The green is a very soft green and it is actually covered in cream polka dots, which match my walls perfectly. It washes BEAUTIFULLY in hot water even with the addition of oxiclean and other agents. I do use changing pad covers on it because I don't want to know if yellow infant poop will come out, lol, BUT overall, I'm pleased. I bought two so this will be the only cover I use with my son *fingers crossed*",5
2514,"I love the cute design of the monkey and the lightweight fabric. It complimented my jungle themed babies' room and washes well.",5
2515,"we bought it and used it once. what a waste of money! the middle part is too flat and my baby was uncomfortable with the bulky sides.",1
2516,"I have both a Medela Pump In Style Advanced and the Dr. Brown's Double Electric Pump. These bottles fit them both well and there are no leaks. Great value since the name brand bottles for these pumps are so pricey! And for the previous posters that mentioned they don't have &#34;real lids&#34; - the lids are a two piece lid that still seal the bottle completely and have not leaked, even with being rattled around in my diaper bag.",5
2517,"They are a bit smaller than I expected and don't have the usual ring pull, but I think they will work. I like the fact that they are used by hospitals. I bought them for a baby shower so they haven't been tried yet by the newborn.",4
2518,"These were cute in that they made my daughter look like she was gearing up for a boxing match. One of the mittens opened on the seam after two washes though (with very minimal wear time) hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I liked the design and that they are bigger then most of the mittens so they actually stayed on her hands.",4
2519,"We hummed and hawed about a changing table for the 9 months of pregnancy until a month after birth. We wanted something that was more than just a table, that would be useful past infancy, and that didn't cost an arm and a leg. We were hesitant to buy something this large online but we are so thankful that we did. It is manufactured wood. so the paint does scratch easily, there are a lot of pieces, and it is heavy, but we love it! It feels so solid once put together and is so easy to keep stuff at hand and organized. Diaper changes are a breeze and it is babies FAVORITE place to be. She smiles and talks anytime she's on the table! The drawers provide enough space for all of our cloth diapers and all of babies clothes. Once she's older it will be a perfect small dresser for her bedroom. If you want a solid, real wood piece of furniture you are going to pay a lot more than this. If you want a functional, easy to use, convenient piece at a reasonable price this is it! I also want to mention the customer service of this company is the best we've ever experienced! there was a small nick in one of the panels and we called them and they sent us a completely new piece free of charge and it was delivered within the week. The representative was super nice as well. And just an FYI sometimes they use scrap wood as packaging to prevent damage so if you have extra wood don't think that you missed a step, its just extras :-)",5
2520,"The Baby Jogger Compact Bassinet is our latest purchase in a growing collection of Baby Jogger products.  We previously had a City Mini with a car seat attachment for our first born but always wanted to have a bassinet.  We have always been happy with the quality, durability and design of Baby Jogger products and this purchase was no exception.This Compact Bassinet is versatile and fits most of the popular Baby Jogger strollers including City Mini, City Elite and Summit XC.  We have the City Elite now and I find that the bassinet was incredibly easy to setup.  The adapters are all included and everything snaps into place within a minute of opening the box.  The hood is very generous and folds down almost at a 120 degree angle over the top of the bassinet which provided perfect cover.  The outer cover is weather proof which I was happy to see after getting caught in a rain storm on our first venture out of the box.  The inside has a soft mattress pad and leaves sufficient room for a new born baby both length and width wise.  I would imagine that we could probably use this up to the 6 month mark or so at the most.It is slightly heavier than I expected however I wouldn't imagine that I would need to carry this for long distances, mostly into and out of the stroller.  It slides easily into the adapters and I wouldn't see this being much of an issue.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and another well made Baby Jogger product.",4
2521,"is a very good product and practice, only is necessary other bottle on 11 once, because the use of bottles on 4 once is limited to one month or less",5
2522,"i love these bottles over the playtex ones we got for our kid, these don't leak and the price is perfect on amazon for getting this set and the other 5 bottle set as well",5
2523,"It's exactly what we needed. I hate the straps that come on shopping carts.  This was works and is comfortable.  Great quality and very pleasant material. And easy.",5
2524,"Great product! Everyone needs this. Great for on-the-go, cleans easily.",5
2525,"These spoons are very soft. They worked well for first solid feedings. If you have an early teether, however, you might find your child biting the spoon rather than eating from them. Switching to metal baby spoons did the trick. We didn't use these spoons for very long, but I liked them.",4
2526,"We searched for months for the right stroller. I just couldn't commit to spending so much on a modes stroller or britax.I finally just went with this one because it had all the features I needed. Love: how easy it is to change the direction of the seat from facing you to facing outwards. Also love how it handles. Easy to push in thick grass and uneven pavement. Big basket underneath.Not so crazy about:  the seat doesn't seem to catch fully when I position it laying back or forward. So when I put baby in it sometimes jerks back an inch or two. Not  ideal for a sleeping baby.This is a heavy stroller I can't just get it in and out with 1 hand.The carseat frame said it would fit my graco snugride 40 seat and it doesn't latch to it. However I was skeptical it would since it's the newer click  connect seat.What I really hate: you need two hands to open or close it. My old chicco stroller was easy to fold up or let out while holding the baby in one arm. This stroller not so easy but I'm learning to adjust to it.Overall: Its a nice stroller for the price. If you are looking for a stroller with multiple positions, a smooth ride and you're on a budget I would say this is a great option.*I will note that a lot of other reviewers said it was too tall for them I am 5'4 and its the perfect height not too low or high. If you're like 5'2 and under then yes it might be too high and the handle doesn't adjust.",4
2527,"Everyone seems to be bothered by the blue lights... doesn't bother us at all.  These monitors are very good and have made me feel very confident that I will be made aware if my child needs me at all, even when I'm in the backyard and she's in her room across the house.",5
2528,"I've never used a different pump, but this one works well. I feel good. But my pump did have a technical problem ( let down button not working) Customer service was good though, they replaced my pump promptly and my schedule was not disrupted. I appreciate their help.",5
2529,"I haven't used any other breast pumps so I can't say if this is better than any other breast pump. I did find it get the job done but definitely not as well as a baby can. I think it's pretty impossible to make a machine that is that effective though. :) I had a breast abscess so I had to use this a bit more than I was planning to use it. I don't think the suction is always great, but if you adjust to get the suction as good as it can be, it's pretty effective. I did find that the battery pack was pretty worthless. After just a few uses, the batteries need to be switched out or it has very weak suction. The other thing I didn't love is that you have to sit slightly forward to encourage the milk to go into the tube rather than to pool around the suction cups. When you are sitting a little bit forward, though, the milk does go where it's supposed to.Overall, a good product. I don't think you get an amazing pump unless you spend the money for a hospital grade one and, for most of us, that just isn't worth it.",4
2530,"The product is great and serves its purpose. Just doesn't feel like it's all worth the money. Doesn't seem to have much alternatives either.",4
2531,"It is OK. We took on our international trip. It is not light, but we needed hot water and a deep container to warm the bottle. It worked well for both of these tasks. Water stayed hot overnight, so even midnight milk could be warmed quickly. Overall I am pleased with this product. Dinging one star for the weight - it is a travel device after all",4
2532,"I wanted to love this. When the first one leaked, I assumed I must have had a faulty product since others who reviewed this loved it so much. So, I exchanged it for another one. The replacement leaked too. Perhaps it was because I didn't store it upright. I put it into a gallon-size Ziplock bag and threw the whole thing into my diaper bag. It was sideways, upside-down, maybe sometimes even upright... I don't know. But each time, there was a little leakage into the Ziplock bag. Not a lot leaked out (just a little), but I guess I was hoping for zero leakage. (Were my hopes too lofty?) Thankfully, I had the plastic bag; otherwise, items in the diaper bag would have gotten wet too.Otherwise, I think this is a great concept. It's a simple, practical and convenient design. Maybe it's the quality that is just lacking.I wouldn't automatically discourage others from getting it, especially if you don't just throw it (any which way) into your diaper bag like I did. If you have an upright pocket on your bag or if you have a way to keep it upright, it's perfect for you!",2
2533,"Love this simple item! Like I said very simple, very handy and keeps the water hot for long time. Would definitely recommend it to a friend!",5
2534,"I was excited to get this pair of insulated bottle holders. They got a lot of good reviews... And so I was surprised when I got mine in the mail. I base most of my purchases off the reviews of others. These are terrible. Maybe they have recently changed and so the quality has gone down since so many of the good reviews... They do not stand up but, rather, weeble wobble and fall over if you place them on the counter even with a bottle in them. They are made of super cheap material with some knock off insulation inside... More like the inside was just painted silver to look like plastic insulation. I confess, I am baffled with the reviews. I am returning them and just going to target to get a nice, small, insulated bag for bottles instead. This was a nice concept and the right size. The Velcro handle is great, too. Why weren't these made properly? Why cut corners on people who are willing to pay a reasonable price for the right thing???",1
2535,"I was a little bit disappointed when I opened the package and seen they were covered in dirt and grass. Maybe the 5 year old Chinese worker was using them to keep his sippy cup warm while they packaged retail goods outside one fall day.",2
2536,"Love the bump at the top so nothing gets in those cute little baby neck rolls =)) best bib for nursing and bottle feeding",5
2537,"These were the best (bar none) bibs for bottle feeding a newborn!! The slight roll at the neckline of the bib really keeps a lot of milk/formula from running down a baby's neck, which can get really gross. Also very absorbent!",5
2538,"These are all I use at home with my 6-month old. Just a little pricey if you ask me, but I really like them.",4
2539,"My 10 mo. old child was not being covered well by the newborn towels we purchased when she first arrived so I needed to find larger hooded towels. This was a great purchase, soft towel that is large enough to cover her wet body after a bath. We enjoyed this so much, I purchased more towels recently. The towels are made well and use quality material. I recommend this product.",5
2540,"I chose these bottles specifically for the shape of the nipple.  Since I was planning on nursing I felt Tommee Tippee bottles were as close to the shape of a human breast as I could find.  The extra parts didn't bother me although the super-wide shape of the bottles made them a little bulky for the diaper bag.  I was not able to nurse and I used these bottles for three months before making the decision to switch to another brand.  The biggest issue was the leaking.  Now, when I say leaking I don't mean from the bottle itself, I never had a problem with that.  My issue was that my son couldn't seem to get a good seal around the nipple and it was a constant leak out of the side of his mouth.  I always had to have a burp cloth handy to wipe his face, chin and neck several times per feeding.  We found another brand that doesn't seem to have the same issue and we've switched to that brand.  I might POSSIBLY use this brand with my next one if I breastfeed, but I would not readily recommend this brand, especially in situations where nipple confusion is not an issue.",2
2541,"Extremely soft, nice color, and the head hole is appreciated - makes it more secure.  However, I have never been able to make it look quite like a pashmina when I actually have a baby under there.  All the movement and pulling means the parts that should wrap around my neck just fall forward.  So, I've got coverage but not style.  What might have worked better would have been to have some snaps to help hold the pashmina drape in place.",3
2542,"This seems to be the only diapering option we have come across that is guaranteed to be leakproof for our heavy wetter.Things we love:1) Has fit our very large son from the time he was 4 months old, to the current time of 17 months. Easily adjustable.2) Love that there is a little &#34;pocket&#34; where you can stuff a small insert just in case. We put a small microfiber insert in there at night just to add a slight bit more absorbency for our heavy wetter. I dont think we really *need* to, but I would rather be overcautious, than wake up with a wet bed and baby.3) Is bulky, but honestly not nearly as bulky as some of the other options we have tried and they didn't come close to being this absorbent.Things we dont love:1) the snaps seem to come undone pretty easily on the rise. (snapping it down to make it fit smaller babies, not the waist snaps) We put this on and have it snapped down one level for our guy so that the cover will go over the whole thing and there wont be any leakage at the waist onto his pajama pants, but inevitably it will be unsnapped by the next morning and the waistband of his pj's will be wet. ick.2) This takes FOREVER to dry. I understand thats the problem with having a super absorbent fitted, but seriously. wow. At least two rounds on medium high heat to get this dried, or on the line ALL DAY long. Oy.3) Can be difficult to get completely clean. It is SO absorbent that its hard to get it to let go of all that pee in the wash. No matter how much detergent I use, how many times I rinse, or how much I agitate it, it almost always has a very very faint ammonia smell. I just cant get it completely clean!Overall, I'm glad I have this diaper in my rotation, but I wouldn't want to make this my only option as far as diapering goes. We use this only once or twice a week and I love that I can put this on my guy when I know he has had more milk before bed than usual (because it will always contain the pee), but I will be leaving it at one. Wont be buying any more.",4
2543,"We have had a few of these bibs. They are adorable and wash up really well. I wanted to love them but the Velcro on every single bib has been so disappointing. It loses it's stickiness so quickly and then the bib starts coming undone while my son is wearing it. Such a shame because they're really cute. I learned my lesson and stopped buying them.",3
2544,"These are PERFECT for Tomee Tipee bottles if you are using formula. They are easy to fill, store, and pour into the bottles. It's genius that they even fit INSIDE the bottle for storage and transportation. Even with water inside!!!  Simply genius.",5
2545,"So.... my baby girl started with the gumdrop pacifier from the hospital when she turned 1 month old. I tried until 8 months old to switch to other paci that i thought would be better shaped for her mouth since she loooooooves to suck all the time...well not other would do as the one from the hospital. So after buying so many others I bought those ones hoping they would do the trick (when she was about 7 months).Well it is perfect! They are of hard but yet soft plastic so no fear of her breaking them, they have a little handle with a hole so I use a paci holder, they are the exact same size as the gumdrop we got from the hospital.They are great for breastfed babies from my experience, as they reproduce the nipple quite nicely.They do not leave marks on the baby face while sucking on them, and fall of the mouth easily when they stop sucking - i like that as compared to some others that they keep the whole time even after they passed out.So far I have still been using the same one for the past 2 months so they are durable.They also wash well : dishwasher or mild soap, the water does not get stocked into it so I feel it is healthier/cleaner than other ones.Overall very satisfied",5
2546,"thought this was going to be a great cup, but it's terrible. the spout will not line up in between the handles no matter how many times I try to reposition the threads and screw it on. it only works when the removable handles aren't on-which totally defeats the purpose of a &#34;weaning cup&#34;. bought the cup for the purpose of a cup so the handles are necessary. what a piece of junk.",1
2547,"Wonderful size for little hands and doesn't leak!We wash ours in the dish washer and then leave out to dry before putting them back together. I have used this for both kids and love them. I did get free stoppers from the company when I used it with my third. It is way cheaper in stores.",5
2548,"I bought WubbaNub Ella Bella Pink Elephant Soothie Baby Pacifier for my friend who just had a baby girl. My baby loves Wubbanub too.

2550,"Very well-made booster seat.  It is contoured, wide enough to accommodate children of various sizes (without tipping or bending), and cushioned enough to be comfortable (without sinking or sagging).The color is as pictured, if not a bit darker.  Attractive espresso or coffee bean color.Now, the booster stays put BEST on solid surfaces like wood, but it also works well on cushions.  If it moves at all, it might shift an inch once in a while--mostly on cushions.  The weight of the child really keeps this booster firmly in place.Be careful if your little one is used to hopping off of chairs, because this raises him/her up quite a bit more than he/she may be used to.  It takes a few days to get acclimated to the new height.  But this booster makes it so that your little one can enjoy most regular tables alongside you.It would also be great for the movie theater, restaurants, places like Sea World, etc.--anywhere your child could use a boost to see well, play comfortably, or eat with ease.Great booster.",5

2552,"My baby is pretty hard to entertain, especially for long periods (over 3 minutes being &#34;long&#34; in this case). She LOVES this toy! We've had it for about a month and she plays with it throughout the day. I actually &#34;save&#34; it for when I need to run to throw clothes in the dryer, etc to keep her quiet. When we first got it, I showed her how to put the balls at the top and at first she was too rough and erratic putting the balls in the top, but she quickly (within minutes) learned how to be more calm and deliberate.She also loves when I put the balls in, one after the other so that all three are going at the same time. The balls themselves are rattles, and she loves to get one in each hand and shake them and bang them together. Best 15 bucks I've ever spent.",5

2554,"I got this fir my baby2, she is 20 mo and i'm still not sure if it helped. All i can say is that she was drulling like crazy and she was pushing her fingers in her mouth till she was choking. After i put the necklace on, she calmed down and i never used tylenol or any painreliever for her. However her teething process slowed down a lot. My baby1 went through teething with a baby tylenol and a few sleepless nights and by 12 mo she had more teeth than my 20mo has now.Other than that the necklace looks very cute, my baby had it on since about 3 mo and i never took it off only a few times for cleaning.",4

2559,"We love this. Even our baby doesn't mind it. Yes, it's loud to use because the vacuum is intrinsically loud, but it's pretty darn effective in getting those snots out. The suction is strong enough and consistent enough to get the job done, but not so strong as to cause worry about using it on Baby. Only thing is that it's only something we can use at home because we don't generally have a vacuum with us outside of the house. (Duh.) For outside of the house, we use theNosefrida The Snotsucker Nasal Aspirator.A few things my husband wanted me to add to this review:1. It can sometimes be difficult to clean. The included pipe-cleaner doesn't always help. Best bet is to clean it IMMEDIATELY after use by running hot water through all the pieces. Don't wait even a few minutes. Hang tube to dry, and leave smaller pieces on the counter on or a dishrack.2. The boogers often don't go into the reservoir like it's supposed to. Instead, it goes down through the tube, sometimes even into the vaccum. We're not sure if this is bad for the vacuum.3. It needs some sort of clamp to keep it in place on the vacuum. You often need to use one hand to keep it from disconnecting from the vacuum during use.",5

Can someone please tell me if there is a mattress out there that leaves no gaps in the play yard?? We only use it for the baby to sleep at grandma's and at the summer house so unless I can comfortably put my 16 month old to sleep I do not need neither the play yard not the mattress.... I'm not happy with this purchase.",2

2566,"This diaper came without the two inserts it was advertised as having.",1
2567,"I received this as a gift, and didn't use it for MONTHS because my son has never liked straw cups. One day his other cups were dirty, so I used this as a last resort, and was pleasantly surprised. He LOVES it! I think the big difference between this and the other cups we have tried is that this bottle offers some suction resistance, so when he stops drinking the water doesn't pour down the front of his shirt.Overall, it's got lots of pros. It's big enough to hold water for a day for a toddler, but not so big and heavy it can't be carried around comfortably. It comes with an extra straw, which is AWESOME, though after only a couple months we haven't needed to replace it yet. I love that I can use the cover to &#34;seal&#34; the top when I need to, and I think the designs are adorable.Unfortunately, there are a couple cons. It's not perfectly watertight, as when the liquid in the bottle changes temperature it can push water up through the straw. It's not really a problem when you only use it for water, but I would NOT put milk or juice in this cup. Also, after a couple washes the design on the front has completely disappeared, so if you're buying it for the cute design, know that it won't last.I will definitely be purchasing another one as a back-up bottle.",4

2571,"I've had this several months now, and I'd been researching double strollers for my twins for over a year. They are now almost a year old. (We started in a double Snap N Go, which I LOVED, but my babies are too big for that now.) I like this stroller even better than I thought I would for my purposes. We live ""in town"" in a walkable neighborhood, so we are on foot to park, pool, library and grocery store. This thing is so perfect for that! It's even fine with the mild off-roading we do through the park. Best of all, it's slim profile allows me to take it anywhere! It gets in the family/wheelchair access bathroom stalls just fine, of course. But I've also taken it through crowded dollar stores with small aisles and boxes everywhere. Today I got through a crowded little garden center just fine. We have not yet encountered a doorway we couldn't pass through. I have this in the ""Greenie"" color and have had several moms stop me and tell me they love the color. I picked it cause we have HOT summers, and I was afraid the black would be too hot for the babies. So far, the green is nice and cool, but it's still early in the season. It does show food smears though, but they wipe off.The steering is fine, not awesome, but fine. It's mostly two-handed steering, but it's better than our old single Combi was. Not as awesome as a Bob, of course, but this is more of a city cruiser, and it's fine for that. You do have to make sure the front wheels aren't locked though. Sometimes that lock gets switched on during handling. It doesn't work well at all with the front wheels fixed.It's not perfect, but the downsides are minor to me compared to the advantages. We had a slight squeak in a wheel after maybe 8 weeks or so of solid use, but it went right away with a bit of WD-40.Oh, and the folding thing. You'll get the hang of starting to fold it then pulling the whole thing up to a vertical position to close the rest of the way to avoid getting the bumper bar all dirty. Awkward the first few times. Again, not awesome, but for the price and size, I'm OK with that. AND you have to make sure the seats are fully reclined to fold it. It's not that big a deal.And the big clincher for me: that big-ass basket. I couldn't function well without that. Big beach bag, waterproof blanket, rain gear, a few groceries, and you'd still have some more room. I don't think any of the other doubles have that feature. Sealed the deal for me.Pros:Narrow profile fits almost anywhereBig basketDecent steeringSturdyPriceWeightExtra pocketsGreat customer service (a human will answer and talk to you in a pleasant manner)Side by side design fun for the twinsFolds up nice and small and quicklyCons:Just average steerabilityAwkward folding moves required (until you get used to it)",5
2572,"I really love my new stroller!  The bottom section holds a ton of stuff and the stroller is easy to drive given its size.  It is heavy to take in and out of my minivan, but I don't mind that having had flimsy strollers in the past.",5
2573,"not much to say here, its a hamper for which you are paying a premium price for as its uppababy. it does the job of holding clothes before you are ready to wash them...",3
2574,"Our 6 month old daughter loves this toy, as well as the plastic key ring from the same manufacturer. It's great for grasping, flailing and chewing on. The complex twists makes it easier to grab from any angle, and gives a more interesting pattern to explore with her little hands. Plus it's made in the US from recycled plastic, which gives me a nice warm, fuzzy feeling, like I'm saving the world or something.Highly recommended!",5
2575,"Because it kept my 9-month-old daughter occupied on her first plane trip...seriously, for hours.They say to give babies/kids a new toy when they go on the plane, so this is what I chose.  It was a hit.  Lots to explore, chewable, and not too noisy so it didn't bother other passengers.  Maybe a little bulky to pack, but the fact that it is so lightweight made up for that.",5
2576,"After taking this on vacation, and using it for lunch at the airport and several other places, we fell in love with this portable booster seat. It slips perfectly into the back pocket of the diaper bag, or in the base of the stroller without taking up too much room. Once we got home from our vacation, our LO decided that she prefers it to her high chair at home, and now uses it daily for sharing meals.",5
2577,"It's not well made and if you have a heavy child.  I would not recommend this booster seat for anyone.  Not worth your money you are better off holding your child on your lap.",1
2578,"I bought this for my son to use in the car.  It's fine except the front needs some kind of closure or else the sides just open up and down goes the head.  I sewed on a ring and a hook to keep it closed.",4
2579,"Good idea for rear facing car seats - it's large enough to see your little one (I've had much smaller in the past and those are unsuccessful for many reasons!) - a few options for fixing it to your headrest - and it can double as a play mirror. I only give it 4 not 5 stars because I found it cheaper at tjmaxx RIGHT after I ordered it!",4
2580,"This is a sturdy mirror and shatterless. I can see my baby just fine and I simply can't drive without it! It doesn't have lights or music like other mirror models but they're not really necessary.",5
2581,"Lasts longer than a different brand I bought, but it scratches super easy and is hard to clean.  ok for a little while",3
2582,"The size of this mirror is great I can get a full view of my son while he's in the back seat and the reflection is very clear. The only complaint I have is the mirror tends to sit crooked after turning a few corners. I dont speed or whip around corners so its not like its being throw around I'm still able to see my son but it gets annoying having to constantly fix the crooked mirror",3
2583,"Couldn't get this to stay put. Safety pinned it like crazy and now it's good. Wouldn't stay at the right angle otherwise.",2
2584,"Love the size of this. Was a little larger than I expected which I am happy about. Haven't installed yet, but seems straight forward.",5
2585,"I previously purchased another mirror and returned it after being told that it was a safety hazard for baby (could possibly become dislodged during a crash) but I couldn't take not seeing my baby, especially when she made strange sounds or was &#34;too quiet.&#34; I strongly urge everyone that buys a mirror to secure it snugly and properly, and to only look when stopped at a red light or when stuck in traffic.",5
2586,"We love this rocker!  It is very comfortable and fits so nicely in the nursery. I am happy with the quality.  It is a nice, sturdy chair.",5
2587,"I use Dr Browns bottles so I was highly disappointed with this sippy cup.  The handles did not stay put and spun around the cup while in use.  I returned this item.",1
2588,"I'm horrible at referencing dimensions before buying things so I know this is my fault. The album is much smaller than I expected. I was thinking I'd receive an album the size of a scrapbook album. This is about half its size. But it's great and it will do the job.",4
2589,"I love that this is so easy to stick and remove.The design is very cute too.This is worth the price.",5
2590,"Grandchild coming soon, got this as a gift. Read many reviews and found this one very favorable. It's so cute, too. Looking forward to using it soon!",5
2591,"blocks my child's line of vision. Bad design.",2
2592,"I have the older version of this dispenser which is still for sale here on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Powdered-Formula-Dispenser-Colors/dp/B0009ET94A/ref=pd_sbs_ba_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1DKFWMHYP3P5BPBDQ0B5) I received this new version as a gift at my baby shower and its terrible! I thought it was just me but seeing the reviews here, I totally agree with the bad reviews. It's much bulkier and takes up more room in the diaper bag than the older version. Powder leaks into the other chambers. Its nearly impossible to get all the powder out and the lid does not stay on very securely.The final straw was when I dropped the container (on carpet mind you! and not from a height of 2 feet maybe?) and this container basically exploded. Lid went flying off in one direction, the container went the other and there was formula everywhere! So here I am with a huge mess while I am frantically trying to prepare a bottle for a screaming baby. This thing is a huge piece of junk. i have no clue why Munchkin would use this new design when the old one worked perfectly fine. I would highly recommend buying the old version of this container. It works great! I'll tossing this one and using my older one.",1
2593,"I love these toys because I don't have to worry about mold growing inside of them if they get into water. They are easy to wash and she loves chewing on the feed of the animals. In my opinion, these are the best bath toys!",5
2594,"And on the second day, they were stained... by watermelon. I know staining is a complaint by some, but who cares? Less food on floor. Less food on clothes. It has saved me so much time scrubbing clothes because I can now often have the twins wear an outfit through multiple meals without fearing the dreaded nearly impossible to remove banana stain. My boys are a bit small, so it sits wide on their shoulders... often ending up skewed to one side or another depending on which hand they prefer to use that meal... so sometimes I wish the bibs were narrower, but they still catch most of the food (which either I recycle to their plates, or sometimes they fish out out of their bibs&#8212;or eachother&#8217;s bibs&#8212; themselves).I use in conjunction with the Summer place mat thinggies that have a little catch for the end of the counter. I have a love/hate relationship with those place mats, but together they keep clothes and floors so much cleaner.I&#8217;d read complaints about the catch getting smooshed, so I just dry it draped so the pocket is stretched open and make sure I don&#8217;t store so it gets squashed. The shape of the pocket is kinda peaked based on how I dry them open, but I&#8217;m not trying to make them look like little princes when they eat... I&#8217;m trying to spend less time picking up food, changing outfits, or scrubbing floors. I spend about 30 seconds washing these after every meal. Beats throwing cloth bibs in the laundry constantly.",5
2595,"This works well for a little while and my son likes the turtle, but get some replacement spouts as they tend to leak after a few months.  Easy to use and the spout is nice and soft for their gums and teething times.",4
2596,"My trio loved these cups but they bit through the silicone nipple and milk's been leaking everywhere!  A replacement nipple costs almost as much as the cup ($3.30 vs. $5)",3
2597,"Idea and design are good but my 18 month old can't get any water out of the firm plastic top.  I even tried and it would take an industrial vacuum to suck liquid out.  Very disappointed, especially given the other good reviews.",2
2598,"This is just a regular nuk bottle with a different spout. My son hated the spout continued using the regular nipples",3
2599,"Returned. Nipple hole was ripped. Haven't had a chance to use it yet... Maybe received a defective one? Will buy a different item.",1
2600,"Bought these for the inside of our diaper pail. What a waste of money; they don't help at all. No fresh scent, no masking stinky scents; absolutely no difference at all. Very disappointing. Don't waste your $ on these.",2
2601,"Great bathtub for a new born and I can tell that this is a tub we can use as she grows.",5
2602,"Shower worked great on my new born",5
2603,"I have really grown to like this wallet. For me, buying a new wallet is like learning to load a new dishwasher, or figuring out what all the buttons on a new cell phone do. In a new wallet, things don't necessarily go in the same place or fit in the same spot. Now that I've got it organized to my liking, it's wonderful. I receive compliments almost daily on how cute it is. In mine I carry cash, multiple credit/debit cards, several forms of ID, library cards, stamps and return address labels, a ton of coupons, old receipts and change. Somehow it all fits without being too bulky.",5
2604,"This is our first kid and love this chair!  Our kid already knows what's about to happen when we roll this out!  It's easy to open and place our little one in.  It has three...yes 1, 2, 3, trays!  It's super easy to clean the trays and the fabric.  I toss the insert in the wash and just wipe down the rest. It reclines but we never used that feature.  I love the fact that this will be the only highchair we will need for our LO.  You do have to store the booster (eh! toss it with all the other &#34;stored&#34; kid stuff).I do wish Graco would make basket or net to hold bibs or wipes in.  My husband took P-cord and tied it underneath and we keep our bibs on that.",5
2605,"A good chair overall, and the baby seems to enjoy sitting in it.  The only annoying thing is the standard Graco straps that come with all their gear.  It's quite an ordeal to buckle up the three pieces while also trying to hold a squirming baby in the sitting position.  A simpler design would've been better.",4
2606,"My son starting using this at 5-6 months and hasn't looked back. It is sturdy, and also looks nice in our kitchen. I really love how it has 3 trays, so if you don't get a chance to clean up after the previous meal, just take it off and there's another.",5
2607,"I debated between this chair and some fisher price ones, because this one was a little more pricey.But I decided on this one because of the following:-it looked a lot safer, and better built than any other seat-I can use it until my baby grows out of a regular high chair and into a booster seat.-it can be used with two kids at once, one in high chair and one in a booster.-seat cover can be wiped easy.But the reason I gave it 4 stars is because the front wheels don't pivot at all and instead the smaller ones at the back do. So it's fairly difficult to maneuver and needs some getting used to.I'd get this chair again if I were to get another one since I put safety of child first before anything.",4
2608,"This high chair is great and this particular color is especially lovely.  We have only used it for infants but it supposedly switches between several different sizes, which will be helpful.  We bought one for us AND for our parents!",5
2609,"I bought this for my almost 9-month-old when it was the lightening deal of the day here on Amazon. I was so excited that it was on sale from its normal price. I usually leave it to my engineer husband to put toys and stuff together but it only took me about 20 minutes to put together. This chair is a 4-in-one, so you can use it from about 3-6 months when baby learns to sit up, to a baby booster, toddler seat and a small child chair (up to 60 pounds). You can also have your older kid use it and your little infant at the same time. The trays are easy to slide with one hand and it has an easy to detach top tray that is dishwasher safe. It has a flat plastic surface that works well to keep the suction cupped bowls, trays and even the Sassy Imagination Station toy in place. Easy to wipe down and the beige cover looks and feels like leather but is machine washable for those inevitable messes. I am very happy with this purchase and it reinforced my decision to put it on my original baby registry. Would definitely recommend. Also, the instruction manual has diagrams and words to help with putting it together which I always like",5
2610,"After looking at various high chairs ranging from $100 all the way to $300, we settled on this high chair because it seems there is no compromise one high chair that does everything right.Pros:- sturdy due to the design (although this is a con later)- swivels decently easy- easy to clean with no real cracks or places for food to hide- like the booster seat for the priceCons:- due to the sturdy design, you can't fold it so storage might be an issue for some- a little hard to adjust height as it's a bit awkward to grab both sides- tray does leave a slight bit of room if your toddler is small- rear wheels seem like they are a bit cheap, might break- who seriously uses this as a chair later on?",4
2611,"easy to use and put together.  It's also easy to clean.  My son seems very comfortable in it. Great product.",5
2612,"This is a very nice chair but honestly I was not able to use it much, my baby didn't like being stuck on a chair. The toy is a big dangerous for a small baby, is pretty hard so when baby starts shaking things...not the best toy to have on hand.",4
2613,"I bought this for my 2 year old, but I would recommend to get these pads as soon as you transition from an infant car seat.We had tried neck pillows but they didn't help her head coming forward when she was sleeping in the car. These pads solved the problem for us (of course, car seat brand and positioning matter).We use them on our Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat. They have memory foam and you can feel it to the touch. The fabric is soft and velvety.",5
2614,"After almost 11 months, we finally bought these pads and we wish we had done so a long time ago ! They are made from memory foam-like material and soft cotton so the car seat's seat belt no longer digs into my daughter's shoulders. I would highly recommend this product, I just wish Diono gave you a pair when you buy their car-seat !",5
2615,"The adhesive on the back would not stick to the oven. Also I don't think that even if it did stick that when pulled strongly the thing wouldn't come off by itself. Total waste of money for me.",1
2616,"We love this item. It was just what we needed. It's aesthetically pleasing (which I think most aren't) and has everything you need. When our son was a newborn he LOVED his little bed. It was the perfect size and he took right to it straight out of the hospital.  So happy we bought this!",5
2617,"It fits my crib great, but does very little to protect it.  The fabric is too thin and little teeth can leave bite marks right through it.  It needs to be made with a thicker inner or under lining.  I purchased the gumi rail cover the wrapped this cover around that.  Do far, so good.",3
2618,"I thought my kid had given up milk. Then I tested these spouts and discovered that all 3 were void of holes in the tip. I poked holes in the tips with a needle but they just don't flow right. He wont use them.",1
2619,"I had purchased Nuk Sippy cups and our puppy got ahold of the silicone spout's and I was so devastated we looked at babies r us Walmart target and couldn't find replacement's only the nipples for the actual baby bottles, So we went ahead searched for different Sippy cups tried 4 other kinds and he did not like them. So glade found these on here they look like the original ones that came with the Sippy they fit inside the lid perfect have not had a leak problem great replacement product",5
2620,"These are great in the beginning, but seems to wear out and leak after several months.  Still cheaper to buy the replacement spouts instead of a whole new sippy cup of any brand.  The good ol' Playtex sippies work the best as well as Tommy Tippee.",3
2621,"don't bother unless you like buying $3 spout replacements every month. Oh yeah, these still allow your child to suck like they do when they bottle or breast feed, so if you let your kids use these much past 1, you'll delay their speech development.",1
2622,"Our kiddo had to play with his food to get used to new textures and improve his eating.  Well, without this bib that meant ruining an entire outfit and parts of his body also.  With this bib things are much smoother and we don't have to worry as much about cleaning up as he makes his mess!",5
2623,"i bought this for 10 month old daughter for her baby pool and she loves playing with it. its nice that the bugs float too.",5
2624,"I was looking for a different kind of water toy and came across this.  Our son loves it.  He uses the net to scoop up toys and likes to play with the water bugs.  The net seems to be pretty well made.",5
2625,"We got this for our 20-month-old to play with in the pool and she loves it!  She plays with the bugs by themselves and also enjoys scooping them up.  Love the colors",5
2626,"My toddler son loves these bugs.  The size is great for smaller kids.  He doesn't really scoop them up but he likes to carry the net and the bugs around even out of the tub.  Boon's a great company.  I've started to give these as first birthday gifts as well.",5
2627,"Good product, as described. We have been happy with all of the Boon products that we have tried. We recommend this set.",5
2628,"For some reason, the &#34;grass&#34; I got is yellowish green. I don't know why. Everyone else I know who has one has really, really green grass.But that really doesn't matter. It still works the same way. It's a good way to hold baby bottles, bottle caps, nipples, sippy cups, pump parts, etc. We usually use ours after items have been washed, but before they get sanitized. The grass and the tray underneath don't get dirty much because we only put clean items on it, but it's also very easy to clean. Just a quick soap and rinse.We can get 12-14 bottles and lids on it. I'm sure it can fit more, but we're not very deliberate about lining up everything to conserve space. After all, we sanitize at least once per day.I'm sure it's just as easy to use a regular dishrack based on how we use this, but the &#34;grass&#34; keeps us from mixing our things with Baby's things.Hope your grass is greener... =)",5
2629,"We use this for drying after sterilizing.  Fits nicely in the dishwasher occasionally.  Doesn't take up too much space and I can store it when not in use easily.",5
2630,"Love this sippy cup. So cool, different and easy to carry by a toddler. The colors are bright and it is easy to clean.",5
2631,"Positive - great non-skid bottom is holding up well in the dishwasher (top shelf only) and is a little harder for my 20mo to pick up. It doesn't skid as she pushes her spoon into the side. Negative - very shallow bowls. Only buy for very young eaters who eat very small amounts.",3
2632,"The plates are pretty and have a nice rubber bottom to stick to the highchair more.  Those who say they were expecting the plates to not be able to be picked up by their little ones I am not sure why they would think that.  Though the plates have the rubber bottom this helps more from the plate sliding not &#34;sticking&#34; them to the highchair.  I have worked with my daughter not to pick up her plates so this is not a problem for me.  The rubber helps when she is using a spoon or fork to keep it from sliding.  I gave this three stars because of the price the plate is rather shallow.  I find it difficult for some foods because of how little and shallow the cups of the plate are.  Been using the $1.50 ones I got from Walmart a lot more than these so that's a disappointment.",3
2633,"my son loves these! they stick on the walls once wet and they float. I think I paid $10 for these and I don't know if I would pay anymore considering Munchkins makes the same product, but its the alphabet, at half the price. I can't say they are the same quality either. These are very good quality and adorable designs. They dry fast too, so I haven't seen any mold/mildew buildup. The colors on the image are exactly accurate either. The purple ones are actually a fuchsia, the neon blue are a pale royal blue. I could go on, but the colors are actually much nicer than depicted on the image.",5
2634,"This diaper cover along with a Blueberry diaper cover I have are my favorite covers! Before you read the rest of my review I should tell you I use osocozy unbleached prefolds which I adore and would highly recommend. I said this first because prefolds are much bulkier than inserts or liners or fitted diapers and my review is heavily biased as a mom who doesn't mind a big, fluffy butted baby! If you use something smaller/trimmer than prefolds then I might recommend Bestbottom covers over this one!So as a mom using prefolds I needed a cover that would *cover* those prefolds! Here are the covers I have tried:econobumthirstiesbestbottomsblueberryand this rumparooz!The best fit over prefolds that I've found is with these Rumparooz and also Blueberry covers. They are fairly similar and honestly I like them about the same. I might favor Rumparooz a bit over Blueberry but mostly I like having both in my stash.The Bestbottom diaper covers are great and I have absolutely no problem with them. They're just a smidge small to go over prefolds. Not unusably small by any measure but using Rumparooz and Blueberry covers (and even Econobums) is just easier!Beyond the fit and size that I love, these diapers have had zero leaks for me even with huge breastfed-baby blowouts. My son has slept through the night in one of these with one prefold on (no extra liner or doubler!) and not felt wet from the outside at all though his prefold diaper was soaked!I love the double gussets around the thighs. My son's biggest issue with diapers is leaking blowouts from the thigh openings of diapers and he's had zero leaks since using these!I also, of course, love the color options! These are *adorable* covers!!Basically I really adore these covers and right now plan to use them for the rest of my baby-diapering years! :)",5
2635,"Using these with the prefolds we have yet to have a blowout.  We have 5 which is enough to get us between washes (every other day)",5
2636,"Cute patterns, strong snaps, extra material/leg gussets... but not very stretchy, can damage in the dryer, & no place to snap in inserts. Not sure I care for the price either, but it's a very cute cover.",4
2637,"I have several different cloth diapers, I have Fuzzibuns, Thirsties, Babyland, Bumgenius, Gro-Via and some handmade wool ones.  By far, the Rumparooz covers are best for me. They are a little more work, since you have to use a Snapi and the old school cloth, but I don't care. They don't leak! I have never had a leak with these diapers, not once. All the other ones I have mentioned leaked, even with adjusting them several different times over and over again. In cloth diapering though, you have to go with what works best for your baby and family, and these do it for us. I use the OsoCozy prefolds that Amazon also sells.",5
2638,"Nice fit good and I will. By again. Just at a cheaper price!",4
2639,"This is one of my son's two favorite teethers.  (The other is the Zoli Bunny Teether.)  He seems to prefer it over most other teethers, and I love that we can just toss it in the dishwasher regularly.  (A lot of his other teethers recommend handwashing only.)",5

This bag is thick and well cushioned, and the outer fabric is thick and seems to be of high quality.As for fit, we took off the rear wheels to slide them into the pockets, and then the bag went in fine.  There isn't extra space, but it fits in adequately and well.The bag, when not in use, is a bit large.  I used a bungee strap to secure the bag into a folded shape and carried the bag on the stroller handle using a mommy hook.I've only used this bag on one trip, but it still looks well.  I think it was a worthwhile investment in the protection of an expensive stroller.  I would buy it again, and I recommend it to anyone who needs a travel bag for your baby jogger city mini gt double.",5
2643,"I originally wrote a marginally funny, two star review of these bottles, but it didn't post because it was apparently slightly risqu&eacute;. So, now I will write a non-funny, one star review. I guess everyone wins except for the manufacturer.Starting at the top.The lid is awful. It has no way to sit on it's top, which means that you either set it on it's base and risk carrying over contamination to the nipple if you slip while putting the lid on, or you put it on it's side, and it rolls onto the floor, behind the microwave, or &#8230; somewhere else.The nipple is even worse. It doesn't work. Tommee Tippee nipples that have a valve are fine. But these just don't work. They are, as a system, supposed to let air flow into the bottle. In my experience, that didn't happen. Instead, my baby sucked so hard that the nipple inverted. Then my baby cried a lot. Then I cried a bit. Then we had a cathartic experience where we burned these bottles in effigy. I tried using a different set of nipples from Tommee Tippee, but encountered yet another problem:The white plastic ring that the nipple sockets into is a disaster. For some reason, it doesn't lock onto the bottle well unless you have the miserable little disc and stick in the bottle (more on that to come). This means that I cannot use the new nipples without using this stupid stick.And the stupid stick is ridiculous as well. I am not sure what the point of it is supposed to be. Basically, there is a disc at the top and the bottom and a stick between them. It changes color based on the temperature of the liquid, which is grand, I guess. But practically, it's another thing to handle when you're cleaning the bottle (which is bad) and another thing that can get dirty. And trust me, baby formula is a FANTASTIC medium for growing pathogenic bacteria.Finally, the bottle itself is not particularly ergonomic, and especially not as ergonomic as it looks. Instead, it is top-heavy. Which means that if you bump it, it will tip over, fall on the floor, land on your dog's head, etc. But what it doesn't do too well is sit on the counter.These bottles are garbage, almost top to bottom. Go get the vented nipple Tommee Tippee instead. Or, better yet, go get Lansinoh's mOmma bottles. Vastly superior product.",1
2644,"Though my child has phase out of these bottles, I have to give this brand high credit. The Tommee Tippee Sensitive Tummy Bottles are fantastic. You can see the bubbles being drawn out as baby drinks the milk, and then you can see the bubbles popping before baby drinks the last few sips. At the same time she has never had an issue with nipple confusion. It has been seamless and easy switching from breast-to-bottle and back. I credit this to the bottle design. We've tried other brands, and she's seemed less than thrilled.",5
2645,"I've been using Dr. Brown's Wideneck bottles for my now 9 month old for expressed milk when I couldn't be with her. My main complaint with those were the many pieces, but otherwise they were perfect. I thought I would give this alternative by Tommee Tippee a shot. In design, they are very similar.  These contain a tube that connects to a rubber ring which fit the opening of the bottle.  Then you fit the nipple into the plastic lid and then you have a cap. Lots of pieces but that's what makes the difference for sensitive tummies. The only improvement I found over Dr Brown's Wide Neck was that the tube has a color changing strip that turns pink when the milk is too hot.  Over all, this a great product but a great company!",5
2646,"We interchange the smaller size and larger ones, our little one (now 10 months) doesn't seem to mind. These were great to have a couple of spares in the car/diaper bag for emergencies. Only complaint is that when I put them in the dishwasher, water gets into the nipple, can't figure out how to dry them out completely, seems a bit unsanitary to me.",4

We are secure enough in our curls to rock blue paci's...but it's not what I ordered or paid for.Nuk paci's are the best, we love them, just won't order this item again from this seller.",2

The divided plate seems to work well, and I really like the non-slippery surface on the bottom. That is my very favorite part of the Oxo plate and bowl collection.  They also clean up nicely, and are dishwasher safe.",4

2654,"This is a great little dish. It is on the small side and maybe more appropriate for putting snacks rather than dinner for a toddler over 1 yo. Grip on the bottom is nice and the lid is a plus if you're going to stick this in a diaper bag for a travel.",3

Not really sure what the other brush is for so I've used it to clean the inside lids of these containers.  The straw cleaner will only get you 4&#34; of cleaning into a straw which is good for a smaller straw like what's on toddler cups.  If you are wanting to clean big thermos or large amusement park type straws, this is not the one for you.  It's only &#34; wide.",4
2660,"I love this! I use the straw brush for our sippys and foogo straw cups. I use the other round brush for all kinds of other things like toys, top of cups etc. The &#34;toothpick&#34; works to get dirt out from small spaces too! It's also great that you can keep them all in the ring or have them separated.",5

I don't know that I would purchase again and will probably just use them to sleep and use the disposables for daytime.",3
2674,"I opted for reusable rather than wasteful disposable pads and I'm glad that I did.  These are a little bulky, but very absorbent and comfortable.  I've only leaked through a couple of times at night during a long period of sleep without nursing.  So far, I haven't had any issues with yeast infections from too much moisture.  I purchased two 6 packs for a total of 6 sets.  I wash them with my newborn's clothes or my clothes, whichever load is being done, and this keeps me from running out of clean pads.",5
2675,"At first, i wasn't sure if i would like these nursing pads b/c they are about an inch bigger all around than the other reusable ones that i own.  They seemed really big and awkward to fit inside my nursing bras.  However, as i have used them, i actually like them MUCH better than my other ones.  I decided i like the larger size better (even though they sometimes have wrinkles when i first put them in, but they quickly flatten out) AND these are better b/c they have a nylon backing to them which really prevents leaking through them onto my shirt (my other ones are just cotton and though thick, they are easily leaked through).  I always choose these when i am going to be out for awhile.  I might just have to purchase another pack and stop using the other ones altogether!",5
2676,"These are nice big bowls.  I think I would rather them be a tad smaller as I am using these for a 4 year old.  These are an adult sized bowl (to me).  So it is quite big for him.  He can use it, but I have to be better about portion control because it looks like less food in such a big bowl.  They are too big to throw into a lunch box unless you have a big insulated bag.So for an adult to bring to work, they are great.  For an adult or older child at home, they are kinda pointless because you would use a regular ceramic bowl.  For a small child at home, they work but are a bit big.",4

They go in the dishwasher. The wipe off easily if you're too lazy for the dishwasher. They don't break when dropped/thrown on the tile/walls. They are big enough for the dog to steal snacks out of. And I don't have to worry about gross chemicals as with some other kid bowls! All around just a great product!Additionally, they are incredibly versatile and durable. Around here they have been used as stepping stones, sand and mud scoops, a base for a tower made of books, tiny chairs, tiny hats, shoes, and I'm sure many other things. They've withstood all of that! Highly recommended!",5

Still, if they can stab the meat/veggie/etc and get it into your child's mouth then purpose served.  However, the spoons are seriously small and the slope of the spoon is quite flat.  You cannot scoop anything with the spoon.  I had infant spoons that picked up more than that.  My toddler is just frustrated with these.So if you're willing to spend the money for the forks, go for it.  If you are really looking for usable spoons, look elsewhere.",3

I normally get the 4 year old out of the car first and then I would have her hold onto my leg while I got the 18 month old out.  But now I just stick this magnet on the car right next to where I stand to get her sister out and she sticks her hand right on it while she waits for me.  She thinks it's fun and I know that she is staying in one place.  It stays on the car great and I like that it isn't a sticker that I have to worry about ruining my car.  The fact that it is a magnet also makes it nice so that I can move it if I need to.",5
2685,"The nursing pillow cover is durable and held up to washing well.  It was a little stiff in comparison to other nursing pillow covers (I also have the boppy and brest friend, and both of those are a softer material).  Because of this stiffness, it is a little bit harder to get the cover on and off, which is why I didn't give it five stars.  Although it is a little stiff, it is still soft enough for the baby and a great addition to the Gia nursing pillow (without it the pillow is bare and wouldn't hold up as well for feedings).",4

He started at 3 months.Never had an issue with springs and my baby LOVES to jump jump jump and repeatedly turn in the chair.3 months: he grabbed the teething toys, turned the pages of the musical book a few times, bounced around4 months: he was able to turn the pages with ease and turn the elephant around to make lights go off and music5 months: he played with the tiger beads on the book bar, played with the music book the most6 months; he was turning the pages to the music book constantly and spinning in the chair with ease, lots of jumping7 months: he reached for the lion, monkey, chewed on the teething toys, used the bead spinner often, lots of jumping8 months: JUMP JUMP JUMP and more jumping, grabbing everything and playing the musical toys a lotBecause he's so tall, I'm thinking he'll have outgrown this in another month.  He enjoyed it DAILY for 5 months so far and I recommend it to all.  When baby jumps, it's great not having tons of plastic gizmos everywhere because they don't cause injury to eyes/face/arms.  Better to be simpler than complex and baby focuses in on certain toys each day so no worries about ""becoming bored"".  When you watch your baby in the exercaucer, he loves to show you all he can do and especially loves to see you cheer him on when he jumps!!!",4

2693,"After ordering one of these joggers, and liking it very much for about a week. I had one of the rear tires constantly going flat (and the front wheel wobbling, even with the proper air pressure as others have commented on) so I asked for just a replacement rear wheel, to which I was told they would not do...but they would send me an entire new stroller. This didn't make much sense to me, as the stroller I already had was very new, but I went along with it, just wanting a stroller with good wheels...because come on, what good is a stroller if it has wonky wheels, right?Soooo....the second stroller arrived, and I did as they asked by keeping the replacement stroller as a whole, rather than just taking one wheel out of the box and sending the rest back, to avoid the hassle of assembly, but truthfully, there was next to no assembly required on this thing to begin with, and it was not REALLY a hassle.I used the replacement stroller for a couple of weeks, and though I had to inflate the tires more than I had to my old In Step Safari (THAT thing I only had to even touch the tires maybe twice a year, and I'm a winter walker) it seeeeeemed better than the first one. Well, that was until the tire started separating from the rim entirely. I use a hand pump...not a high powered compressor...and I check it carefully, so as to not inflate too far...but this thing seriously started coming apart..I could see glue...and my poor toddler who happened to be IN the stroller at the time, was thumping around horribly, as it felt as though the entire left rear wheel had a huge lump.After two times, with two different strollers, and the SAME manner of wheel problems, I said enough is enough, and instead purchased the Graco Trekko with rubber, never flat tires and am sending this one back as well.",1

So we went looking for a solution and the piddle pad was recommended. Bought this one, and I am no longer frustrated with in car seat tee-tee accidents. Love it! Easy to install.  Looks nice. Appears to add comfort to the seat. Easy to clean.  I also recommend purchasing the 2 pack vs a single one.  This way you can swap out a clean one, while the other is in the wash.  You can even use the second backup in the stroller seat, in the meantime.",5

I found the pump easy to use though I think a woman with small breasts might have trouble with the large suction cup on this one, as it may be too large for small breasts. It does a pretty good job pumping the milk though it does take some time. All in all, I think for the price, you really can't ask for much more.",4

The larger screen is a big plus in comparison to the other models.I dont use the music although there are 5 tunes to choose. She didnt like it when I tried it.My only complaint is the battery life. I keep it plugged in all day for a full charge. When I go to bed around 10 p.m. the battery is dieing or dead by 6 a.m.",5
2709,"We bought this monitor before our son was born and used it for 15 months and loved it, I recommended it to my pregnant friends too. It stopped working right so we'd have to take the battery out and put it back in the handset just so it would turn on - didn't matter if it was plugged in or fully charged. We also had to start re-pairing the camera and hand set. We've given up on this foolish monitor and replaced it with another one. For the amount of money we spent I think it's ridiculous that this didn't last longer and that Motorola doesn't stand behind their product. I would never buy one of their products again.",1
2710,"After trying multiple monitors I stuck with this one.  I've used the same one for 2.5 years and could not be happier.- Supports multiple cameras and can auto-flip between them.  I think it can handle up to 4 cameras- Easiest user interface I have seen in a monitor.  I don't get the reviews talking about turning on the light at 4am to see what you are doing.  If they are doing that, they don't understand how to use the navigation.  There are 4 buttons on the right side, if I want to turn on the monitor in the dark, with my eyes closed, I just hit the third button on the right.  Not sure what the big deal is.  If I want to turn the volume up or down, I hit the top button, then the arrow up or down which is on the left side. Absolutely easiest thing ever- Nice big screen- Great range- Pans and tilts greatSeriously... Best. Monitor. Out. There.",5

2712,"We bought our first Motorola MBP33 2 years ago.  Within a year, the power cord for the monitor unit frayed and unraveled until it became useless/dangerous.  We bought a generic power adapter at RadioShack.  The battery life was never great, but it gradually got to the point at which the unit wouldn't hold a charge anymore.  I bought a replacement battery off of EBay.  That worked for about 1 month before it too died.  In the meantime, the parent unit would sporadically drop it's signal and begin beeping loudly with an &#34;Out of Range&#34; message.  This was super annoying at night when you're sleeping.  After this one died, I bought another set, thinking that I could link the cameras and bc I was too lazy to research a different monitor.  Besides, what are the chances that I would have the same problems as before?  Hah.  The exact same problems, and within 1 year - the battery won't hold a charge.  I've gone through 2 of these within 2 years!  Since we are expecting another kid soon, I want to have a reliable baby monitor and it definitely won't be this one.  I had picked this monitor based on it's excellent reviews and bc at the time, it was difficult to find a multi-voltage video baby monitor - and we travel a lot between the US and Asia.  Now there seem to be a lot of multi-voltage baby video monitors available and while I'm sure they all have their pros/cons, this is one that I would only recommend with the caveat that it will probably die within 1-2 years.",2
2713,"The infrared night vision is awesome - you can see your baby's face, even in the dark. The monitor has a fairly long battery life and a nice sized screen. It has many functions allowing you to speak to your baby through the monitor or to play music in the room (we don't really use these - but they seem like nice features if you needed to calm your little one.) It has a good range of coverage - we even walked over to the neighbors once to test the range, and it worked. It is also pretty loud. We had the prior model before we got this one and the cord frayed and the port for the charger had to be perfectly situated in order to charge. This occurred after a year and a half of everyday use - so I guess its not so bad, but a little disappointing. We are very pleased with this and would recommend this again.",5
2714,"I am very happy with this purchase. The quality is great. The picture is very clear,  so clear that we can see our son breathing as well as hear him breath.",5
2715,"Overall, it performs well and great in quality. Screen is of good size and great clarity. Good reception and audio feedback. However, I dont know for what reason, the baby monitor is always running low on electricity although it isn't turned on for long. It is extremely energy consuming and annoying having to recharge many times.",3
2716,"This monitor works very well.  Having the video is a must-have, I have no idea how nervous first-time moms did it with just audio monitors!  The only regret I have of buying this is that I wish I would have gotten the model with the remote pan because my son is a mover in his crib and I wish that I had the ability to adjust the camera from my bed rather than trying to adjust it by hand and not disturb him.  Also, when adjusting the camera view, you can't get the video unit too close to the camera or else it will squawk loudly so you have to leave the monitor in the other room, adjust the camera, walk out and check it, and then go and adjust it again, reapeating over and over until you have it just right.  The music is klunky and loud so I never play it and the picture is a bit grainy but it's just fine for what you need it for.  I love that it's color in the daytime and that you can adjust the contrast on the screen which helps at night.  I'd definitely recommend this monitor (maybe the next model up with the remote pan?)!",4
2717,"My one-month-old loves to be held, swaddled, and rocked/swung/bounced. Putting him in the Moby Wrap is the only way I get anything done, and I KNOW it will be a huge help with kid #2 when I have an infant to hold and a toddler to chase simultaneously. It takes a few practice tries to get the wrapping down (I find I have to make it WAY tighter than I originally thought), so make sure you have Baby very secure including his/her head before you enjoy your hands-free movement. And ready the directions! If you don't have the child's head correct, you run the risk of suffocation, overheating, etc. As long as you use this correctly, it's awesome!",5

2724,"This is a nice little contraption for little ones who can't quite reach the sink.  It fits easily onto the faucet, but the material is kind of cheap, so it slides around quite a bit, and I think it has stretched out a little over time because it doesn't stay in place.  I got my daughter a taller stool with 2 steps, so she can reach the sink now, but now she just wants to play with this thing, which has certainly shortened its life span even more.",3
2725,"The fabric is soft and nice.No sharp edges on the stitches around the perimeter (two thumbs up).It is somewhat small, which is not a drawback for me, since I prefer to carry a stylish small diaper bag.

Right now he can grab the toy, but starts swinging around and hitting himself in the head.  The pieces are a hard plastic so I worry about my son leaving a little bruise on his head...I'll give to him when he's older.",4
2730,"My Baby LOVES this! It was a great buy!",5
2731,"There is a lot going on with this little toy. It is easy for my son to grab and he has a lot of fun with it. My son has been using it for about a month (age 7 months until his current age of 8 months). He loves it and so do I.",5
2732,"My four month old loved this. The color is very eye catchin and the raddles keeps him busy n the mirror is kool",5
2733,"now that he's reaching out to hold things. The colors, noises and easy to grab shape intrigues him. Also easy to clean in soapy water, rinse and blow dry!",5
2734,"My little girl just got this for her first birthday. I don't think I would have ever bought it because I didn't think it would be that interesting, thats why gifts are so great...she loves it! The opening to the purse is pretty narrow but just right for little hands and, from the looks of it, makes pulling things out that much more surprising and fun. She likes me to put the bracelet on her and now attempts it herself. She tries to put things BACK in the purse now as well, this is after watching me do it for her MANY times :) but thats what learning is about, I love seeing little progressions like this! She still likes to destroy most things I organize but little toys like this are great to help her focus on putting back what she takes out. One small thing at a time.... thankful for this cool little gift.",5
2735,"I really, really love these liners with our Potette Plus travel potty and trainer seat. I love that they fit perfectly since they're made for it, but also, I especially love the absorbent pad in each liner so you're not just carrying around a bag of liquid after it's used until you get to a garbage can. But when my potty training daughter goes through 5 liners in 3 hours, it starts adding up. Small garbage bags are cheaper and work as well if you throw in some paper towels (though not as absorbent). One star taken away for the price, but I will still definitely buy them for longer trips and when I anticipate not having garbage cans available regularly.",4
2736,"We've been using this cup for our little guy for about 4 months now and here are some of my thoughts on it:- Extremely durable: we originally ordered it in time to take with us to Disney World to make sure the baby had an easy way to stay hydrated through the long days.  It got dropped many times and held up great.  The straw cover does pop off pretty easily, but snaps right back on.- We love the slit tip straw.  It's great for younger babies who are just starting to transition to a cup.  Other straw cups can flow too fast, but this was perfect.  Straw is also not too narrow for thicker drinks like smoothies.- Our baby loves the handles on this cup - it's very easy for him to carry around with him and hold to drink.- This cup is one of the most leak-proof that we've used.  The only time we have any trouble is when a cold drink gets warmer and the pressure change in the cup makes it leak out the top of the straw a little.- Only down side is that it's a bit of a pain to clean.  The cup is rather narrow to get your hand in if anything gets stuck to the sides inside.  The straws and lid are not too bad to clean with a straw brush.",5
2737,"Big fan of these cups. Easy to clean and easy to assemble. I have ordered about 9 of these now. I would recommend getting ordering a few extra straws my son bit threw a few of his!",5
2738,"This play gym was more moderately priced than some of the others, but it is very good quality and very cute. My daughter loves to look at and bat the little toys.  I do wish the toys did something other than crinkle/jingle/squeak but it's very nice anyway.  Little one also loves the mirror that came with it, I attach it at the top so she can look up into it. It's like a funhouse mirror, not very clear but she likes it.  I have purchased some extra dangle toys from Lamaze and Bright Starts and clipped those on as well. Great purchase! No reason to spend $100 on some of the other ones in my opinion.",4
2739,"This cover doesn't fit well on standard restaurant high chairs.  I find that my son ends up sitting on the seatbelt and there's lots of useless material around.  It's not really cushioned either.  And it doesn't roll up easily into the 'storage bag' that's attached.  Waste of money.  I purchased a floppy seat cover and like it much better.  It's a little more bulky, but it stays put much better!",2
2740,"Love the print and how well it fits on every cart I have used so far. I won't leave to the store without it now! Easy to install and my son enjoys the new view :-)",5
2741,"It fits on the grocery cart nice but it doesn't fit the high chair well. It's a little bulky and doesn't really fit the diaper bag. It's easy to clean though just put it in the washer and hang to dry.",3
2742,"This is a useful product to have around when you take your little one w/ you to the supermkt. Easy to put on and keep clean; what more can you ask for? With this product, you don't have to worry about your kid touching the nasty handle bar of a cart or sit in a dirty seat. Of note, this item has no padding.",5
2743,"So nice to take in the carts to keep the germs away! Good product for the money! Plus it's super cute!",5
2744,"I was looking around for a lighter stroller so I thought I would try this one.  I was not too optimistic because it was such so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I used to have a really expensive one and this one is almost the same.  the only difference is that this one is way lighter and it does not turn as well.  I don't mind the turning wider because everything else is great.  I love that I can lift it into the car easily as well. I also love that I did not have to spend a ton of money on it, I would recommend this to everybody.",5
2745,"I love this stroller for lots of reasons, but one in particular and why I recommend this stroller to all the mommies I know.  There is no 5 point harness.  We use this stroller for shopping trips, day trips to the zoo, playground, aquarium... etc.  There is no need for a 5 point harness when we will not be doing anything rigorous on that trip, in fact the 5pt hinders movement and is not conducive to easy in and out access.  This has a slim profile so it fits down almost any shopping isle easily.  This is not a stroller you'd use when you're out jogging or &#34;off-roading&#34;... but for everyday things, this stroller is it.  Plenty of room in the basket for my purse and his diaper bag.  Lays back just enough for him to have a bottle if needed or a quick nap.  I will point out that there is a con in the design when folding up the stroller.  There is virtually no way to fold this stroller without scraping the front tray on the ground, you could remove it each time, but that is a pain.  Ours is a little scratched up in the front but nothing horrible, still totally worth it.",5
2746,"I got a deal on this playard!  This is so far holding up.  This is our 2nd playard, that we keep at Gramme's house, which is also our daycare.  We originally purchased it for our home, but it was too wide for our bedroom.",5
2747,"We ordered this as a spare / travel pack and play and it doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that others do, but it works great!",5
2748,"We would have given it a 5 star rating, but returned it because it's really heavy.  We are lucky to have relatives with a house that is equipped beds for babies so we didn't need it.",4
2749,"My baby quickly gre out of the smaller pack N play and so I searched on line and found this one. I purchased it at a store because I was traveling immediately and couldn't wait for delivery. This version is bigger but still very portable and easily put in the trunk or back seat along with all your other luggage. It is very fast to unfold and put away. The bell hop watched me do it as he loaded my other bags onto the trolley thinking I would take forever to get it packed up. I folded it and put it in its' case in about 90 seconds. He was impressed and stated so. This pack N play also had a really nice feature. It has rods running underneath the mat along either side. This prevents the mattress from bowing. It stays firm and FLAT. My other pack N play bowed and my child would invariably find herself sliding to the middle perpendicular to the sides and her head and feet would bump the edges and frustrate her. This one is noticeably heavier than the smaller version but well worth it, sturdy, convenient, portable, safe and comfortable for my baby.",5
2750,"The pack n play is quick and easy to assemble and disassemble, and folds up really compactly. It is perfect for traveling. The biggest downside is that the &#34;mattress&#34; is like a padded piece of cardboard. I will be buying one of those 3&#34; real mattresses to use with this product.I find the bassinet option to be very useful- it is basically a net that hangs so that the baby is a little higher up and easier to reach. Great for infants so you don't have to bend and put them all the way at the bottom of the pack n play",4
2751,"Perfect for my Grandson!  This folds out easily, folds back up easily for storage, doesn't take much space, and seems comfortable.  I appreciate the soft sides as my Grand son scoots around when he sleeps and ends up with his head against a side sometimes, but the sides are soft and breathable so he's not uncomfortable.  Graco and Sheet World have soft fun sheets that fit this well.  I'm glad I bought it.",5
2752,"It doesn't have much coverage and its pretty flimsy. I need something larger and more sturdy to meet my needs. Something my child's highchair can roll over without it moving.",2
2753,"These are awesome I don't know what people do with out these. Eventually they will wear the little tab rips but they are still functional. We've been using them for about 10 months",4
2754,"I love this crib. Because the sides of the crib are all the same height, it is very unobtrusive. I also like that it can be placed anywhere in the room in any direction. My only concern is the mattress height. We currently have it set at the lowest height possible, yet when my nine-month-old stands up in it, the top rail is below his shoulders. Simply because in a few months I feel my son will either be able to climb out or fall out, we won't be able to use this crib as a crib for as long as I would have liked.",4
2755,"I have tried several brands, and these are my favorite.  I wear them all the time, and they protect enough for nighttime and aren't visible during the day.  I have recommended them to others and I will continue to do so!",5
2756,"I was so disappointed in these pads. I had used Lansinoh nursing pads and they were wonderful, so I thought these would be too. Unfortunately, they leaked on me! This happened a couple different times. I'm usually one who will just suffer through so I don't waste the product I've already bought but I had to just stop using them, leaving at least half a box.",1
2757,"It's great, but the suction wears off after about 10 washes on the top rack of the dishwasher. It was a great starter bowl.",4
2758,"I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;ve never gotten it off the granite countertops, but it sticks pretty darn well, prevents accidental knock overs. Only been a problem if I try to ignore the babies too long and they get bored. Also best if the granite is dry. If their is enough slipperiness, it gets easily nocked/pulled to the edge of the counter, where it then breaks the suction. I have no idea if the spill catcher actually does much... admittedly haven&#8217;t been paying attention, but I&#8217;m pretty sure i&#8217;ve washed yogurt off of it. No wear problems yet, but I&#8217;ve only used 10ish times, and I just hand wash so it&#8217;s ready for the next meal. Have used at 11m. and 12 m. with my twins.",5
2759,"okay two weird issues&#8230;okay, this one is not so weird, but be warned that the bottom storage is annoyingly small. everyone complains about it, and everyone is right.secondly, the harder you try to steer this stroller, the more astray it goes&#8230;i know, that sounds crazy. but don't even over think it when you push the stroller and you'll be fine&#8230;unless you're me and you keep running your child into the racks at the department stores. and then you look even more stupid because you repeatedly keep running him into them because you're not trying hard enough to NOT think about it. make sense?oh shoot! three issues! thirdly, and everyone complains about this, but it is definitely an issue for my child that the seat doesn't sit upright enough. he is constantly straining against the harness to try and sit up. it's really becoming enough of an issue where i am considering getting another stroller&#8230;okay, now i'm done.",4
2760,"The person who designed this tray can't possibly have ever tried it out attached to the stroller and in the presence of a child. It sticks so far out from the stroller that even with the restraint straps fully extended, my son leans forward and is still several inches away from being able to touch the tray.  It's also a challenge to unlatch so you can flip it out of the way. If left in place on the stroller when the stroller is folded, it adds almost an entire foot of additional length to the stroller which made it so that I could no longer fit it into the back of my 4Runner without turning and tilting the stroller at an odd angle that takes up the entire cargo space of the SUV. I have been using Britax products for my children for more than eight years and loved them all, this item is a huge failure and has tarnished the quality Britax name.",1
2761,"Easy to install or take it off, and I don't need to take it off when folding the stroller. The only problem is that our neighborhood has uneven brick sidewalks and sometimes my child bumps his mouth/lips when he is holding a sippy cup in front of him.",4
2762,"This bag is so thin. Don't waste your money. You could probably use the Brica travel bag with wheels to fit the stroller. It is big and worth a try over this.",1
2763,"We used this to carry our car seat on a plane and it did a great job of protecting it.  We could also put the additional car stuff in the bag as well.  Don't know if it fits non-Britax.",5
2764,"Did not work on my Medela",1
2765,"It's been working as expected for 3 months. Smaller and lighter weight than the original.",4
2766,"Its very convenient and easy to keep baby stuff organized. Easy to get to everything that we keep in there. I had a basket which I replaced with this changing station and very glad I did that!!!!",5
2767,"I loved these diapers for about 18 months. Then I noticed that the elastic inside was ruined and created a gap in my son's legs causing leaking. This happened to almost all our Charlie Banana's, but not to our FuzziBunz or Grovias. I did contact the company and after multiple emails and facebook messsages they replaced 13 diapers, which was nice, but I am noticing that a few of my newer ones (purchased in November for 2nd child) are running in to the same problem with the elastic. These are great diapers, but definitely will not last you for a second child (and maybe not even for the life of your first child).",2
2768,"So soft and comfy. My daughter was so comfy in this as a newborn. But she is tall for a baby so in two months she grew out of it. But it is a helpful thing with the head support. I would recommend this to new parents. And its machine washable. That's a big +",5
2769,"For our first daughter we did not find out the gender and got a neutral car seat. Now, we're in the home stretch waiting baby GIRL #2 and so I was set on getting an insert to make the seat a little more girly :)Because it's summer now, I've got the pink side facing up and the fabric is not quite as cozy as the other side nor as soft as the regular car seat cover, BUT I have no complaints about it either.In the Baby Trend infant seat, the side body is really fluffy and while good for a newborn, seems to cramp the space for slightly older babes. The harnesses seem to work well around the snuzzler, though for my NB using the lowest setting, the straps are probably not &#34;as recommended&#34; because they have to go over the side body insert and back down to baby. Head support is good, not too fluffy or big, removes easily for carseats that already have one or kids who no longer need it.",3
2770,"We got this floor gym because (1) our baby's occupational therapist advised that we get one because he has low muscle tone and needs to work on reaching his arms, (2) it got good reviews here on Amazon. I'm really not sure how this product got such high reviews. It looks really poorly made and the design is just plain stupid. When following the instructions for assembly, it definitely can cause the mat to close up on the baby. To avoid this accidental trap, you actually need to NOT follow the assembly instructions and criss-cross the bars (like someone else had advised in the reviews).But my chief complaint is how low the toys hang. Two of the toys, in particular, actually get so close to my baby's face that they touch his face and makes him cross-eyed. Instead of trying to reach for them, he just rolls aways from them. One of the toys even touches his face! The toys are supposed to be adjustable in length with the given rings, but each ring is at least 2-inches in diameter, so you can only adjust them 2-inches down if you want. You can't actually hang them from the bar without the rings, so each toy is intrinsically going to be at least 2 inches down from the bar, which is how far they are when they stupidly hang so low that they hit my baby's face. I grant that my child has a big head, but definitely not big enough to be his fault for such low-hanging toys.And this light-up tiger that everyone raves about in their reviews is just not interesting to our baby. He doesn't even care.To sum it up...Pros:Lots of black-and-white featuresGiraffe pillow is good for tummy time and encourages reaching in a tummy positionCons:Overly low-hanging toys (don't be fooled by the picture on the box or on the website)Little flexibilty in getting toys to hang at the &#34;perfect&#34; lengthCheap-looking materialsCan be a trap when assembled according to manufacturer's instructionsI'll be looking for another floor gym.",1
2771,"This crib is mostly good. It's well built, sturdy when put together, no chips or scratches. It's a much brighter white than the picture, I wish it had been more of a bone color, but it's fine. I like that where you place the mattress is solid wood instead of springs.",4
2772,"Purchased for baby they wash well and work well also. They are very light weight  for a summer baby. I did notice some unraveling on one mitten after a few washing's but a simple trim of the thread and it is still holding up.",5
2773,"Got these mitts for our newborn and barely used them. Not the best mitts, don't stay on their hands very well.",3
2774,"I was looking for a larger bib as I started feeding my baby solid foods around 5 months. This was great. It came down over his whole torso instead of just covering the upper part of his front side. The velour-like material is very soft. I don't mind wiping his face or hands on the bib when we're done. There are also two snaps so he can probably use when he is even bigger.",4
2775,"Good bibs. Big size, so actually good for 0m and up. Front is soft, back is like acetate. silly billyz is softer and has a cloth back, but are smaller, I think those are nicer, but this is equal once size is taken into account. Great vibrant colors. Strong snaps. Keeps baby clean and dry.",5
2776,"This thing is great (so far), I've used it on 2 flights. I have a Britax Marathon, and it fit perfect in the upright position. Easy to get in, and there is actually enough room in the 'seat' of the carseat so stick even more stuff! So on the way back, we stuck one of our soft carryons in there so we didn't have to pack it around. One flight I gate checked it, 2nd flight I checked it as baggage. Both times it came through in one piece, yahoo!",5
2777,"I ordered this for my granddaughter 's car seat when we travel.  It's great to use when taking the car seat on the airplane.  I check it in with baggage and the cover protects the seat and it's easy to carry and convenient.",5
2778,"I used this with the B-Safe infant car seat without the base. The bag is much bigger than I expected and it had a lot of extra space after putting the car seat in. I suspect that if I had put in the base as well, it would have been a better fit. But despite that, the bag held up really well. Both the wheels and the strap came in handy during various stages of travel and it kept the car seat safe. I actually checked the car seat in with our luggage so I'm surprised that it did not show any signs of wear and tear.",5
2779,"I liked these spoons because they are easy to use with baby...he likes to feed himself and the wide handle is easier to hold. They came just as described in the add new and in packaging, fast shipping too.",5
2780,"i usually like the life factory company products but i do not like the sippy cup top on this on. its really hard to suck water out of it. my 3yr old can't, my 10 month old can't and can't either. i also emailed the company and they didnt help with the problem either.",2
2781,"I wasn't crazy about the nipples because they are too small. (comparable to the dr. browns or evenflo). I like a more wide mouth nipple but I use these to pump into (they attach to my medela pump) and i bought the Caps that the company sells and they are very convienent.why does this thing make me say more in order to type a review. i have nothing else to type/",5

2784,"I have had this monitor for 2 months and I still don't know how it works. It has some pretty sophisticated programming options, but there are very few buttons on it. You therefore have to push the few buttons in very specific ways to get it to do what you want it to do. It feels like having to learn binary code. Once it's working, it's great. But if you turn off the camera, or there is a power outage, it takes a while to get the camera and monitor paired up again. So if you don't notice until bed time that this has happened, you either spend bedtime pairing the monitor, or throw up your hands and fix it in the morning. If this thing were less complicated, or had dedicated buttons that do very specific things, this monitor would be worth 5 stars. As is, I give it 3.",3
2785,"I was researching several video monitors at the same time.  I thought this one had the option to talk to my son through the monitor, but it does not.  That is the only thing that I would change.  Good product, especially for under $100. Great night vision.",4
2786,"I love the big screen on this monitor. It  has a clear picture and the video camera gets all of his crib, rather than just half of it like our old monitor got us.The battery life is good (lasts all night) and it has a loud beep if it is dying. I wish the screen showed how much battery was left, but not a big deal.I love that the sound only kicks on when he makes noises and doesn't pick up our white noise machine. We don't have to sleep with his white noise all night that way!The customer service has been EXCELLENT. Our antenna on our camera piece was broken and Mae provided quick, friendly, personalized responses about the issue and took care of it for us.This monitor is a great product at a great price!",5
2787,"really good price for the function. the image is clear and sound is loud. you can adjust brightness and volume too.",5
2788,"The quality of the picture is just wonderful! My husband set it up and it did not take him very long at all. Just what we needed.",5
2789,"After months of researching monitors I eventually came to the conclusion that they all have their ups and downs so I just went with this one because of the reviews and price. The picture is clear at nice and during the day. I have no issues at all with the sound or battery. I just charge it in the morning and when I go to bed I put it back on the charger. I can hear baby just fine even with a loud window ac running in his room. The price and quality of this monitor match up and I would recommend it for anyone on a budget.Update* after a few days of using we noticed that while in vox the monitor was not coming out of standby mode  through the night after even when charged. Customer service offered a full replacement and had no problems.",4
2790,"Got this as a gift and it works great so far.  I would say it's a good value for a video monitor with basic features and works pretty well.  I added a few extra cameras so far.The only design flaw I see so far is that the cameras have on/off switches.  These are not-battery powered so a power cord is required.  So WHY would you need any sort of power switch?  If your paranoid that big brother is watching then unplug the cord.  The only reason I can see that they designed this with a momentary power switch is to annoy you when the power goes during the night, power comes back on but the cameras will not turn on until you go into your sleeping kids' rooms and press the dumb buttons.  Whomever field tested this idea needs an early retirement.",3
2791,"It works for us. I mean the screen is a good size. I've seen $150 ones at my friends and they seem nothing better. I have no idea why anyone would spend more on the same item. Plus I find the baby blue color to be appropriate for a baby item as oppose to one that look just like any other electronic items (black and white)It's easy to use and functions just as described.",4
2792,"For the price, you can't find a better video monitor. I thought mine was broken the other night and was so frustrated. So, I went online to see if others had had the same problem and realized I just needed to read the instruction manual. I had inadvertently turned on one of the many nifty features that come with this monitor. It was super easy to turn it back off again and I haven't had any &#34;problems&#34; since. From &#34;breaking&#34; it, I discovered there are multiple modes I was unaware of that are actually really useful. Anyhow, long story short, if you think yours is broken, read the manual. You'll probably be able to fix the problem and you may learn some really cool and useful features that you wouldn't have discovered, otherwise. :)",5
2793,"We chose this monitor because of simplicity and price.  The picture is very clear, even on the night vision setting.  We like the ability to pair additional cameras in the future as our baby grows from infant to toddler.  At first we weren't happy because we couldn't figure out how to get the video to automatically shut off, turning on only when the baby made a sound.  (Reading instructions always helps.)  Once we figured that out (press the Volume + and the Brightness + indicators at the same time and you will see VOX ON appear on the screen) we have been happy parents.  This little system works fabulously.  In fact, our friends just bought the same one for their new addition.  Definitely would recommend this product to anyone.",5
2794,"We had an existing video monitor, but with having more kids needed additional monitors and tried this model due to some of its unique features.What's so great about it:- Supports up to 4 cameras from one receiver, provides unified system for monitoring multiple kids in different rooms.- Has a silence feature where the monitor audio/video turns off when there is no activity, but turns on when there is noise. This prevents the constant white noise while you try to sleep (like other monitors do).- Inexpensive compared to many alternatives.What's not so great:- When using less than 4 cameras, you have to scroll through the &#34;empty&#34; channels each time you want to rotate through the cameras.- Silence feature doesn't reliably turn back on- Night vision viewable distance is pretty short, unless your rooms are small you will need a night-light on in the room to see anything.- Battery in receiver stopped holding charge after 1 year- VERY poor quality on the power cables, they simply stop providing power due to small breaks in the wire in the cable - I have had to repair, replace two of them in 2 years. For plugs which mostly remain in the same spot with occasional relocation, this is pretty bad.Summary:It worked well enough for us when our kids were babies, but once they got older the longevity of this product became an issue.",3
2795,"I like this product. I can see my baby clearly. It has a feature that allows the video to go into an energy storing mode that turns back on when the baby makes noise. This is nice so that you don't have a glaring video on the entire night! I only wish that it was able to be angled better to look down into the crib without having to mount it on a wall. Right now we just have it perched on some objects next to the crib angled down so that we can see him.Overall, I recommend this monitor.",4
2796,"Perfect for labeling things for daycare, as well as homemade baby food for the freezer.  If you don't need to put a date on them, and you use a Sharpie, you can actually leave them on the container and they'll stand some hand-washing.  Best part is how easily they come off when you want them to.",5
2797,"First time mom expecting twins and using cloth diapers. I needed a large pail made from non-caustic material, wouldn't retain orders as plastic often does, heavy enough to hold up to tail wagging of large dogs or the occasional bump into. I did my research and this brand and size fit my needs with a bonus lid lock. After many empty years and Invetro we are expecting twins, one girl and one boy, so my standard requirements for baby items is pretty high. We plan to purchase a second pail exactly like this one.",5
2798,"This filter was made for the diaper pail I purchased. Its made of odorless carbon exactly what I needed. If you've ever opened a closed container you know what I mean. They last long which makes them cost effective. I plan to purchase the orange filters also.",5
2799,"I had initially introduced these balls to my daughter when she was 2 months old, and she initially had no interest in them whatsoever. In the past month or so, she has come to love these balls and they are her favorite toys at the moment. They are easy to grasp with little hands, and develops great motor skills in babes who are learning to reach for toys, grab them, swat at them, throw them, chase after them, etc. Simple concept for a toy, but she prefers these balls over anything else on her playmat at this time.",5
2800,"Nice to keep one in the car so that we always have a straw cup handy. The only caution is that if you put the straw in the lid and then try to put the lid onto the cup you have to be prepared for a splash. Best remedy to avoid this is to put the lid on the cup and THEN put the straw in the hole.",4
2801,"My Little one was introduced to these cups at 7 months old. I could squeeze the sides, so she could taste the liquid on top of straw. As of 9 months of age, she quit using all her bottles and moved to these cups. The one issue now at 11 months, is that she likes to remove the straw and drink from the hole, and make a mess....",4
2802,"We ordered 3 types of straw cups - these, the Nuby 2 Handle Flip n' Straw Cup, and the Playtex Lil'Gripper/Anytime cups - for our 10 month old daughter. These cups on a 5 point scale so far:Drinkability (ability of our daughter to sip through the straw): 5 stars. She can easily drink through the straw - since there's no valve system, its the same as a regular drinking straw. Slightly harder for her to grip, since it's uncontoured, but no big dealWashability (ease of dismantling/cleaning/reassembly: 5 stars. There are 3 total pieces including the top. It's dead simple to put together Top rack dishwasher safe, also easily cleanable by hand.Leakproof?: 2.5 stars so far.  There is no valve system, so this barely qualifies as leakproof.  However, the top of the cup securely holds the straw in place. If you put the straw all the way to the bottom of the cup and turn the cup upside down, the cup will only leak the amount of liquid that's in the straw.  I can see where after a bunch of use, the top might no longer hold the straw and it *could* start leaking around the straw as well. For the price, though, just toss it if it starts leaking and buy more.Oh, and this also fails the OCD test - we received four cups: 2 red, 1 orange, 1 yellow; the tops we received: 2 blue, 1 red, and one green; the straws we received: 1 red, 1 yellow, 1 green 1 blue.  ACK!",4
2803,"These are great for the car and also good for toting snacks like fruit chunks or dried snacks. I would buy them again.",4
2804,"I got these for my 18 month old. The best part is that there are few other options out there for a legitimate cup with a straw for this age group. They are inexpensive and are easy to wash, etc. Also, the straw is pretty sturdy in the cup, it takes some doing to get it out. The straw itself is hard plastic, not like a typical soft straw. I like this because toddlers want to chew everything to death so this gives if some durability.The reason for the 3 star review is because these cups leak to high hell. I will say that they are not marketed as &#34;spill proof&#34;, and I know that. But still it's so annoying. If you don't put them in a ziplock bag you will flood your diaper bag. And it happens no matter how straight you keep the cups. Secondly, do not ever close the lid after filling the cup, with the straw in it. It creates a pressure point and you will be sprayed with water big time. I speak from experience. Overall I recommend these. Just know what you're buying.",3
2805,"We took these to Disneyland and they worked GREAT! We didn't lose any and now use them for long walks in the stroller and in the car, keeps the risk down of losing the good water bottles. No valves to clean, which is great when you are on the go.BEWARE: fill these cups and put the lids on WITHOUT the straw in the lid or it will shoot a stream of water at your face when you snap them shut.  I just pull the straw out, hold it in my teeth while I fill it up and then stick it in the lid after it's secure -- no drips!",5
2806,"I spent hours researching different straw sippy cups for my ten month old, and of course there isn't a perfect cup. I spent a considerable amount of money on a Tervis cup with a straw lid but after trying these, I will save the tervis for when she is older. These are light and not too big so even at ten months, my little girl has no trouble holding them herself. I have yet to have a leaking problem, just make sure you put the straw in AFTER you put the lid on or else the pressure build-up will cause some overflow.",5
2807,"I needed a bag to send to daycare for my baby's cloth diapers. This is the perfect one. It is the right size for a day's worth of diapers  - can easily hold 2 days worth, but isn't one of those giant bags meant for a week's use. Just hook the strap on to any rod / edge of diaper table etc, and snap in place.I also got the large Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry bag but it's not as useful. Too big, has handles that don't open and snap so you'd have to tie it on somehow. It would be great for taking when we go swimming or to the beach, will hold the whole family's swim clothes. Just not right for what I intended it for.",5
2808,"This bag is much smaller in person than it appears. I doubt it's ability to hold 12+ diapers now that I've seen it in person, but we'll see. The material feels kind of cheap but the print is nice. I should've gone with my usual Planet Wise wet bag.",3
2809,"I love these bags, you can use them for ever. I have had one for 2 years now and it had held up great. It can hold a lot of cloth diapers.It can also hold 4 beach towels and a 3 swim suits and lots more uses I have found over the years got another for the new baby. Happy with item, great for shower gifts.",5
2810,"The Kanga Care wetbags make cloth diapering easier for me.  Before finding the Kanga's I had smaller wetbags, which held about 5-8 cloth diapers (depending on my LOs output for the day ;).  These bags hold SIGNIFICANTLY more.  They hold at least 15 diapers (including liner and insert).  These hold in the smell really well and the design choices are adorable!  I throw these in with my diapers when I wash.  No problems to report.",5
2811,"Doesn't completely block the smell of my son's cloth diapers, but none of my other wet bags do, either (neither do diaper genies or any other diaper pails I've ever seen).  I like the size and the hanging loop a lot, and the seams seem very well sewn.  I can fit 4 flip covers, 12 inserts, 4 BG freetimes, and cloth wipes for 3 days with some room to spare.  It can be a bit awkward to get the last few diapers in there when it is close to being full because the zipper is not directly on top, but it isn't too much of a hassle.  For the moment this is my fave wet bag; I also have a Planet Wise (second fave) and Charlie banana (wicks badly after 9 months).",4
2812,"I bought this to replace our Planet Wise bag after the zipper broke. Our PW bag had plenty of use, so there's no surprise the zipper failed. Instead of buying another PW bag, I wanted to save $12 and try this wet bag out. I wish I had spent the extra money on a different bag. It's much smaller than I thought considering some of the reviews saying it fit a good amount of diapers. I hang the bag on a closet door next to the changing pad. I never realized how much more efficient a bag with a zipper on top could be. If this bag is very full, it's difficult to open without having a diaper fall out. It gets the job done, but I wish I hadn't been so cheap.",2
2813,"Bib works as indicated.  Just wanted something so baby doesn't spit up milk all over her clothes.  Material is also soft for skin, but it's not terry cloth, just a soft cotton",5
2814,"The colors are much less vivid in person than online. This was disappointing, but the bibs are well-made and I like the side-closure and the snap, which is much less irritating to my baby's neck than velcro.",3
2815,"These, like all aden + anais products, are wondeful.  Nice cotton material.  A lot other bibs have a plastic-type coating or lining.  Those kind get a moldy smell very quickly.  I love how these are cozy, cute and wash clean easily.  Yes, my drooly baby has a soggy bib some of the time but it's better than a smelly, soggy bib.",5
2816,"These are huge! I thought they would be for a baby's drool but they are more for those babes that eat. Not what I wanted at all! But it could be what you want!",2
2817,"I purchased these beginning of June, 2014.  I love their look, their texture, the optional 3 length side snaps.Unfortunately, they're not very absorbent.  Although my 3 mo LO is a huge drool monster right now.",3
2818,"These bibs are OK, they don't catch the food that falls, and not liquids that spill, plus they are small in size so I have to change my baby's shirt after she eats.The good thing about them is that they are made out of nice material.",3

2820,"I have both the Vista and the G-Luxe in my stroller fleet.  When we traveled to NYC this past Spring, we took the G-luxe because of it's weight and size.  Besides making quality products, UB also has impeccable customer service.",5
2821,"It's ok not great. It's a slightly darker than the photo and the inside black circles fade quickly. Ive only had it a month. I was not impressed. I already bought another bag.",2
2822,"I had a much more expensive diaper bag that I bought online.  I liked it, but it had a very rigid structure and was smaller than what I wanted.  This is flexible and I can put a lot more stuff in it.  As others have mentioned the lining feels cheap.  It isn't that big of a deal to me but I can tell this is a poorer quality than my other bag.  There aren't as many pockets either, but for $60 it is cute and functional.  Most of the bags that are cheaper than that look like a diaper bag and aren't cute.  I just can't bring myself to do that :)",4
2823,"I've purchased one of these and one of the gray ones directly from Ikea. The girls love them but they do tend to mildew after a while. I've machine washed them and they've held up well but the mildew is next to impossible to remove from the suction cups,  even with chlorine bleach.I went ahead and bought a replacement via Amazon for the convenience, even though I think they're cheaper in the store. My local Ikea is a bit of a drive, though, and it's always crowded. It's worth a couple extra bucks to just order from Amazon unless you otherwise need to make a trip.",3
2824,"This is a cute bath mat and I do like it a lot, but it is slightly smaller than it looks and my son is constantly pulling it up and tossing it out. I'd say it's almost more for looks, but it does work pretty good too being as my son hasn't slipped yet.",4
2825,"Many moms swear by amber teething necklaces. I purchased this one out of desperation. My infant son was constantly fussy for no apparent reason, so I tried the teething necklace. I guess teething wasn't his issue at that time, because it made no difference. It also annoyed him. When he was older and I was sure he really was teething, he hated the necklace and wouldn't even let me put it on him--neck, ankle, wrist, anywhere. Eventually I gave the necklace away to a neighbor.It is well made. The clasp and the beads all seemed secure. No problems with quality.",2
2826,"I use these to keep a heavy floor lamp from tipping over. They work great and are easy to install and adjust.",5

2828,"I love this changing pad.  It is soft despite having a vinyl/plastic lining.  It's waterproof and it's not too big or small in size.  Fits perfectly in our diaper bag.  I sometimes use it when I'm in someone elses home and put baby to sleep on their bed -- just in case baby has a diaper explosion or pees through his diaper oh and the drool of course.I will purchase another so I can have a backup while I wash one.",5
2829,"I like this car seat.  I purchased it because of the great safety ratings, but it is also cute, gender-neutral, and very cushony.  My daughter did get hot and sweaty in it sometimes.  She never liked riding in the car until she got old enough to sit upright in her convertable seat and play with her toys, but I don't think it was the car seat's fault.  I like that you can buy additional bases so that you can snap the car seat into different cars without having to mess with the car attachments.  It snaps in very easily.  Sometimes it was a little difficult to snap back out.  I made the mistake of also snapping into the top section of shopping carts before I learned how dangerous that is ... please don't do that!  (Thankfully we never had any mishaps.)The stroller is nice but very bulky.  It takes up most of the trunk space and doesn't fit through airport secutiy machines so they have to take it check it by hand.  However, I like the shade and the under-stroller storage.  It does fold up very easily one handed, but it's too heavy to lift one-handed, and I could never get the hang of unfolding it one-handed without tipping it over.  (The reason this is important for you new moms and dads is that you are often carrying baby in the other arm.)If I had it to do all over again, I would probably purchase just a car seat and two bases (for the two cars), and get a really nice baby carrier like an ergo to carry the baby around in.  It seems like it would be really convenient to be able to transfer a sleeping baby from the car to the stroller without waking him/her, but in reality my baby never slept in the car.  Since she hated riding in the car so much, she pretty much cried the whole time.  Then she just wanted to be held.  I would try to get her to go in the stroller, but ultimately ended up carrying her and pushing an empty stroller around more than half the time.  So it would have been easier and more convenient to just put her in a baby carrier and walk around hands free, and she would have been happier, too.",4

2836,"is practice, is a very good help to feed the baby with hygiene and expeditiously, spacious and comfortable to put their bottles",5
2837,"My daughter had thrush and so the doctor recommended sterilizing her bottles. Reading through the reviews on this one I was kind of concerned since a lot of people say it started to rust, but I can safely say after five months we have not had that problem. I think the mistake people are making is that after each use you need to wipe off the heating element in the bottom. Letting standing water sit on metal is going to produce rust, so just wipe it off.The only negative I have to say is that it doesn't fit Dr. Brown 8 ounce bottles well. If you sterilize them you need to also use the top part and then balance it on top of the dr brown bottles. It's not ideal but I think it works well enough.",4
2838,"I bought this when I was due with my first baby, and while it is a good product and easy to use, I've found I don't use it very much. I just end up hand washing bottles one by one as they are used, and find I can get them nice and clean that way. Occasionally I'll throw them all in for a &#34;deep clean,&#34; but rarely.",4

They are really heavy and would fall out every time he started to fall asleep, waking him up.  Finally bought some MAM pacifiers which are very light and he loves them.",1

One caution, make sure you buy the right age size, the 6-18mo size is considerably larger and my boys refused the larger size even when they were much older.",5

My husband and I couldn't stop laughing. It was the cutest thing ever!We bought this because my daughter has been falling and hitting her head as she's learning how to balance and walk. There was a faint smell when we opened the package but not bothersome. The material is great, very thick and easy to clean up messes. Very colorful on both sides. You can't go wrong with the price either. I would've gotten the XL but am happy with the large.",5
2848,"IT is robust, colorful, entertaining, and educational. Our lo learend some animal words and concepts by using this mat as a conversation piece. I would recommend this.

The mat helped him to crawl and it doesn't hurt him even if he falls on his head.This is one of the best purchases I have done. Even though its expensive but its worth spending money on this item. At times I even nap with my little one on the mat :).",5
2850,"Excellent product, easy to clean and durable.  Opted for this instead of the puzzle pieces because of it being 1 piece and thick/cushioned.  I put my weight on my palm against the mat and it will dip the mat down, but overnight, the foam comes back up to shape.",5
2851,"I ordered these after reviewing the other brands and how easy they were for kids to figure out.  These fit securely and will definitely keep the kids in/out.  These work a little too well and sometimes and can be tricky for adults to use.  It is difficult to lock the handle on exterior doors with these on due to the opening for lock being small for an adult male fingers.  I just defer to the dead bolt for security for use on an exterior doors.  They snap securely on the top and bottom.  The adults just need to remember which way the handle turns on the exterior doors and they will be ok.  Interior doors are no issue because they turn both directions.",4

I originally bought him a regular training cup with a hard plastic spout and since he has never used a bottle or cup he had no idea what to do with it. This cup has a soft spout so that when he puts it in his mouth he can chew on it and get some water. He is learning that the cup is for drinking and not just a toy this way. I also really like the handles, they spin so that he can hold it however is most comfortable for him.",5

2858,"First of all they're adorable!!Second they're a really good quality!They are the only of all my covers that have snaps that don't feel like they'll break. I like all the size options. I can get a good fit on my baby with these.I don't have any real complaints, you'll be happy with these!I do prefer my Rumparooz or Blueberry covers but I use prefolds. If you use liners then this part of my review won't make a difference to you....With bulky prefolds you need a bit more coverage. Rumparooz and Blueberry covers do better. My Bestbottoms fit but it's a bit more effort to get them around the prefolds. They have worked so far but I just prefer the fit of the Rumparooz and Blueberries. If I went back and reordered my stash I'd skip this diaper and go with those other brands. But like I said earlier, for inserts or thinner diapers like fitteds, these are wonderful and I highly recommend them!",4

Snaps unsnap too easily though, there's no front or back pocket to stuff an insert, & they're a tad expensive. They also aren't as stretchy as some of my other covers, but these seem high quality material.",4

It's adorable and the same quality as their other diaper covers. We never thought we would use cloth, but it's so easy with these.",5

2867,"I also have the heavier one as well and they are simply amazing. I plan on buying them for friends baby showers. I have not seen these in stores. They wear so well and after use every single night for many months they still look good. I swear it's what helped him feel comfortable and sleep through the night. He won't sleep without it! He is 10 months now and we have the lighter one on him now because it's summer. I can't say enough about these, I only wish they were cheaper so we could afford a couple at once. If his gets dirty now we have to wash it fast because he won't nap well without it. Excellent fabric.",5

2870,"These seem to work great. No issues with leaks. My little one is 2 months old and she can go from 9 at night to about 8 in the morning and we haven't had any leaks. I will say they do make the diaper very bulky and give her &#34;splayed&#34; legs, but they do the trick. They don't take that long to dry, which is nice.",5
2871,"I've only used this in a shopping cart so far but it works great. The cover fits great over  the walmart shopping carts.  I love that you can attach a toy too!  Washes well.  A little interesting to fold up.  There's no directions really on how to fold it up but I just winged it and it worked.",5
2872,"I have used this with no trouble on many shopping carts including Target's and many public high chairs. I can do a shopping cart with one hand, it does take  a minute though so I generally steer to the side as I get it on so I don't hold people up in the entrance of the grocery store. Baby loves the teether that comes attached to it. I get lots of compliments on it.it washes easily in the machine and I'm very happy I purchased it. Would use for a boy or girl.",5
2873,"The newborn position is to have his feet up under him inside the pouch. It was clear this was not comfortable for him. He also loved to look out, but was too small to do so and got upset quickly.I tried it again now that he is 3 months and can sit with his legs out the side. It works pretty good now and will definitely keep using it.",4
2874,"It's a good product.  Only downside is the straps are sooo long.  Which means sometimes while you're putting it on , the straps drag on the ground or floor.",3
2875,"It is so cute to see my husband carrying the baby around the house in this while he does the dishes or shows the house off to the baby.  It is great because it fits me at 5'1 and it fits him at 6'4 without having to rework any straps.  The ties hold very strong and it can be worn with the baby facing you or out.  My husband puts a small blanket or towel in the bottom when he faces the baby out for a little extra support on the bottom so the baby sits upright better but it isn't needed, I don't do it but I am breastfeeding so I have other ways of holding the baby.",5
2876,"This lightweight carrier is great for the summer. However, it is not the best carrier for beginners as the ties can be difficult to manage with the baby. With practice, this is not an issue, but you probably want to try it out a few times at home/around the house with a second adult to help.",5
2877,"I have 3 kids and have used other carriers in the past and I have to say that I prefer this one by far!!!For starters, I love the design. I think its very chic looking and a different look from your usual carriers that are the generic black on black with no design element to them at all. When I first looked into this type of carrier I was a little worried about how safe my baby would be in it as there are no belts or buckles to it all. Let me tell you I have had no problems with that at all. If you follow the insructions, which are very simple and straightforward you'll love this carrier as well. Comparing this product with other carriers I do think that it takes off pressure from my lower back that I would feel with others. The reason that I gave four stars instead of 5 is because The sashes themselves are very long. I'm a pretty short petite woman 5'2 and for me as I'm bundling up my little one the sashes touch the floor and can get dirty.  But its a breeze to just wipe it down with a wipey or something of the sort. By the way the part that touches the floor never touches the baby, its what ties behind the baby's back. I just dont like to see it touching the floor thats just me... lol All in all I would def by this again!",4
2878,"I got this baby carrier in hopes that it wouldn't hurt my back. Plus, I'll admit, I thought it looked pretty darn cute with the pattern and all. . . I normally use a Baby Bjorn carrier that I got at a yard sale for $2. . .can't beat that. Comparing this with the Bjorn, the Bjorn is so much easier to use in that I just clip it on real quick and I'm on my way. With this one I have to tie it and it's kind of a hassle to get it on every time. If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have bought this. It's cute and trendy, but not super functional in my opinion. However, if I hadn't used the Bjorn prior to this, I probably wouldn't be as picky. . . and most people probably aren't as lucky to find a baby bjorn for only $2!! :)",3
2879,"I really like the carrier! I was a little bummed your baby can't face outward, but there's an option to place your baby on your back, so they could still see if you were able to do that. I don't use it as often as I had intended to when I bought it, but every time I do use it, I am grateful I have it around! It's fairly simple to put on. I'm a single mom so wearing my baby on my back is too dangerous for me to want to attempt, but I do just fine with the other two positions.",4
2880,"Feels sturdy and a good weight.  I'm waiting for our baby to get a little older to fit more properly.  Easy to put on and adjust without help which is great.",4
2881,"I originally purchased this for my 2 month old but i feel it is not supportive enough compared to other wraps and carriers.I'm keeping it though because it is lightweight and will be good for travel when baby is older.",3
2882,"If you breast feed, you need this. If you like getting things done but love snuggling your baby and are torn between cuddling them and prepping dinner this is amazing! I was able to nurse a very demanding nurser and lose my baby weight walking while discreetly nursing him under my cardi reversed",5
2883,"First off, I am a petite person! I am 5'1 and 115 lbs. I had the basic infant carrier by Infantino with my son, but it was like I never could get it tight enough! My husband was able to use it very easily though! So, when I became pregnant with my second, I found out about the Mei Tai carrier! I noticed on a lot of the reviews that some of the people were small like me. So, I decided to go for it, it was not too expensive, so it would not be a big loss.I love it! It is so comfortable for me to wear! The shoulder straps are padded so it does not dig down into my shoulders! I can make it fit me very snugly! I love the detachable hood! When it is sunny or windy I know she is protected! I am still able to move around very easily! I wear it when just cleaning around the house to grocery shopping and zoo or park trips! I love how versatile it is, that I can wear my daughter in different positions as she grows! She loves it too! She loves to be close to me and goes to sleep instantly! She is currently 3 months and about 12 lbs. I have no problems carrying her. My husband still uses my other carrier for him (plus it is more masculine looking), he says that he refuses to use my mei tai, so its great I kept the old one!Overall, I do not think anyone could go wrong with this! It is awesome!",4
2884,"This wrap is great for newborns!! It's easier to wrap than other brands. My 2 week old son loves this. He falls asleep in it immediately, once I have it on. I watched a few online videos on how to wrap it. It's really easy to put on and feels really secure. The inexpensive price is a major plus. It's great quality! I really love it.",5
2885,"This might be &#34;universal&#34; for the Infantino variety of carriers, but it is not universal in the sense that I can be used with any type of carrier. I bought it to try out with my Ergo carrier. It works ok, but the bottom doesn't keep my baby's legs covered as much as I had expected, hoped, and thought that it would. This makes the carrier disappointing. I really thought &#34;universal&#34; meant that it could be used for different brands of carriers, but that doesn't seem to be so true.",3
2886,"I use this all the time!  It's so nice that it just hangs on the carrier and has 'pockets' for my son's feet.  The pockets for mom's hands falls really low on me, but that's not a big deal.  I wish they made this waterproof for walking in the rain",5
2887,"I had bought this but the caterpillar one and she loved it, so I bought it for her cousin too. He loved it. The babies like the crinkly sound lol",5
2888,"Of course my 2YO daughter loved it. The material is a little &#34;silky&#34; feeling so the pillow case and top sheet slides off a little easy. One negative I have is that the comforter developed a little tear in it after several washes.",4
2889,"So I had a family emergency per say to get to out of state I'm 7 months pregnant with 22 month old. Who obviously needed his car seat for travel after we landed. Instead of me trying to corral him and tote my car seat and carry on I simply strapped him in and pulled him along. I gate checked this (with car seat) attached and it arrived at my next destination. If your a frequent flyer I say get this!! A must",5
2890,"It's not the most wonderful chair in the world, but for the price it's a great buy.  I prefer a pillow at my lower back, so I don't actually feel the amount of cushion, but the shape is fine and it has held up well.  The side pockets are nice for stowing baby items.",4
2891,"Great value for the price. Was super easy to put together, comfortable enough. My big butt fit nicely im 5'9 238lbs after just having twins lol. Only problem we've had with it is getting up while holding a baby, its a bit low to the ground. Not uncomfortably low whe you're in it... but I had to lean way awkwardly forward to stand which irritated my csection.  Also one of the arm rests has a pocket. Surprisingly useful. No regrets here.",5
2892,"When the babe was a few weeks old we took a trip to Portland for the day and 3 dirty pacies later we knew we needed a solution. This pacigrip is great because it is not made of cheap plastics that easily break like others. It has a strong grip that never falls offs, saving those precious pacies from the nasty floor. Now we can travel with just one pacifier! And the print on this one is super cute!",5
2893,"Thankful for the clip, stylish, but more importantly, it keeps track of the pacifier so I don't have to worry about keeping up with it.",4
2894,"I feel like I could talk forever about how great this diaper cover is but that would bore anyone reading so I'll list out what I have tried and why I lovelovelove this cover.I have tried:bestbottom coverseconobum coversrumparooz coversthirsties coversand of course this blueberry cover!My favorite is a tie between this blueberry cover and my rumparooz cover. For more information I use prefolds (osocozy unbleached prefolds, which I also love and highly recommend) and these covers fit *wonderfully* over them! They're just the prefect size! I LOVE the double gusset around the thighs to contain ANY size of breastfed baby blowouts! hahaThis cover has a high rise in the back (not too high, just right) and the pattern (I chose giraffe) is ridiculously cute! This cover (and my rumparooz) is the first I reach for from my stack of covers! I'm always sad when this cover is in the wash and I'm forced to use my other ones instead.Just an additional note: the snaps feel super weak on these. I haven't had any issues with them so no critique there really but compared to other diapers I have they feel like they're going to pull right out of the diaper when I use them. But again, they *haven't* had problems so... as of now I still rate this diaper cover at the top of my list!My final thoughts and recommendation:Blueberry and Rumparooz covers withOsocozy unbleached prefolds (4x8x4) with snappisORIf you are prefer a little more trim diaper I'd suggest Bestbottoms covers with Bestbottom liners or Bestbottom covers with kissaluvs fitted diapers. The reason I personally prefer Blueberry and Rumparooz over Bestbottoms is because they're slightly larger and cover a bulky prefold better.  I don't mind a big butted baby (why I use prefolds!) but some people do and to you I would say Bestbottoms might be better. HTH! :)",5
2895,"My little one is now too big for most one size diapers.  So after much research I decided to give these a try since it goes up to 40 lbs.  My child is around 35 lbs.  These fit great with a lot of room to grow.  I highly recommend them.",5
2896,"In total we have used 6 different baby gate brands/types - this is my favorite of all of them.What's so great about it:- Capable of forming angles - I use it to gate around a right angle around the landing of our stairs.  I also created a makeshift banister kit by zip-tying a 1x1 to the banister to provide a wood edge to screw the mounting brackets into.- Can be removed entirely without removing the mounting hardware (when you need to space open for moving, parties, etc.)- Easy open and close with one hand- Automatically closes, but can be left open- After daily use for years its still going strong where other brands have had repairs needed on their locking mechanismsWhat's not so great:- Its a little flexible due to its length and adjustable &#34;joints&#34;, but not to the point where I ever worry about kids pulling it down or breaking it.- You may need to make adjustments (additional spacers on the wall depending on your baseboards, to ensure a straight fit as the gate is intended to be all the way against the ground (to avoid tripping)Summary:If this gate fits your space and desired mounting method - get it.",5
2897,"This teether is adorable and my son enjoys all the different textures it has but he does not like when I put it in the freezer to chill the two wings on top that have water in them. The other plastic and rubber materials get too cold for him to enjoy chewing on it when its cooled but overall it still serves its teething duties well",4
2898,"the setup on this crib is soooo easy. good quality product, small footprint and very portable. not sure how long my baby will fit in this, though. she's 7mo right now, so it will be interesting to see how it serves us once she can stand/climb etc! overall a great purchase, and it will definitely be used for future babies or when we have visitors with little ones!",5
2899,"I purchased the guava baby lotus travel crib and the baby bjorn travel crib for an upcoming trip across the country. Initially I thought I would like the lotus better, but the baby bjorn won out. We like the fact that there's sort of a 'bumper', meaning that the fabric is solid closer to the mattress. My son sleeps best when he can't see out. I also preferred the mattress, which I found to be much thicker and more comfortable and the fold, which I found to be much less complicated and quicker than the lotus. We're happy to have the bjorn to take with us on all of our trips because my sons sleeps so well in it!",5
2900,"Purchased the BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2 for our baby's first international trip--because we didn't want to use the hotel's basic/hard crib--and it was well worth it! Have used it on three international flights since then and countless road trips, and it has held up! PROS: Easy to use, set up time is approximately 5 minutes, maybe less if it's your 2nd/3rd time using. It's convenient, lightweight, easy to carry, and the mattress is soft. CONS: Too big for carry-on, have to &#34;check it&#34; on a flight. The carry bag that comes with the crib lasted 3 years for us, but finally ripped at the seam the other day. This might be a pro since it has held up so well through our countless trips. We have actually seen baggage claim personnel throw it onto the plane's baggage belt (frightening)...but there were no issues when it was opened. Probably an easy fix for a seamstress.",5
2901,"so my husband and I can put this up by ourselves, which a huge plus.  THat said, this thing is way expensive!!  I think thinking back on it, that it's just too expensive to use (that said we have twins) so we ended up just using the graco pack n play.  It's 1/4 of the cost, a few pounds more, and not quite as easy to set up yet easy enough.  Not so much harder to justify a 150 dollar difference that I'd rather use on educational toys or a wagon or something.  That's jsut me though I guess.",4
2902,"Honestly I'd give them more of a 4.5. After experiencing unpleasant thrush I had to find a pad that was comfortable and did not allow yeast to flourish. These worked great for that! The bamboo is more hygienic and the cloth allows for more air flow. The softness of the bamboo was also nice on my poor sore nips! They do however bunch up a little hence the half a star.",4
2903,"I like this snack cup because it is stainless steel.  It is much larger than other snack cups, which I do and don't like.  My son can now remove the lids to these kind of cups, so it's pointless to give him the slotted snack cover since he just takes it off and pours the food all over himself!",4
2904,"I read reviews and bought it anyway. The lid doesn't stay on, I wish it did. My kids still loved having a cute bowl with handles. I loved that its stainless steel. The color on the bottom did chip off some after much use and being dropped on concrete, tile floors. Still a cute bowl with minimal plastic, would buy again.",4
2905,"Got this for our daughter when her baby was born. She loves this monitor and can follow the baby's sounds/movements from anywhere( even outside the house) with her smart phone or tablet. Should be a great choice to monitor your babysitter too. USB cable needed.",5
2906,"Good design. I like the extra rain cover. It slips a little when you put the carrier handle up and down or try to move the cat seat canopy but it's not complicated to slide back in place. I live in Texas and it was definitely a must have to deal with this sun and heat.",4
2907,"We use this cover with our Chicco Keyfit and it fits perfectly.  It is a useful cover that protects from sun and bugs.  It is easy to fold up when not in use also.",5
2908,"This is a great canopy. Perfect for summer when it's hot and don't want baby to overheat. Has good air flow and blocks out sun really well.",5
2909,"This is great for taking out newborns in the summer to protect them from the sun and insects and also from the rain.  I used this all the time when I took my son on walks.  Love it!  I think every mom should have one.",5
2910,"Started with the Bjorn but my back handle that after LO hit 14 pounds... plus wasn't happy about how ergonomically incorrect it was.  Thought about the Ergo but the panel is barely high enough for my now 8-month old wiggle worm, and I didn't think it would have the longevity I wanted (although I'd have happily used it from 14 pounds til now).  In my experience, the Pognae is comparable to but more affordable than many of the other SSCs out there.  I like how the hood tucks away as I lost the hood to my mei tai in a week.  I also like the mesh panel - we both still get sweaty when it's hot and muggy out, but it's nice that LO gets a little fresh air, especially in milder weather.I'm 5'3&#34; and find it very comfortable both in a front and back carry.  We regularly take about 2-mile walks in it.  It's quick to get into and out of, especially with a front carry, which is nice because my little dude is impatient to the max.",5
2911,"I loved having this for my mother when I left town for a few days on vacation with my DH. It made for little waste when it was time to thaw out breast milk. It is the safest way to thaw quickly!!",5
2912,"These fit or Ergo straps perfectly. To avoid having to wash our carrier frequently from our little chewer I wanted ti find some drool pads. However, I didn't want to pay $20 for something so simple. These were cheaper, cuter, and fits like a charm. Great quality too!",5
2913,"My little guy is a biter - he'll chomp whatever gets near his mouth.  Because you're not supposed to wash most soft-structured carriers often, it's been incredibly helpful to have these drool pads.  I'm glad my carrier isn't getting as crusty and gross as the pads get; I just throw them in the wash and we're all set to go.",5
2914,"These are very cute and have come in very handy for my milestone photos, but...they are not very sticky.  Before I even have a couple of pictures taken, the sticker is peeling up and you can tell that in the photos!",3
2915,"I am very pleased with the quality of this chest.  I would have preferred it to be even bigger, as my child has a lot of toys, but finding any chest bigger for the affordable price would have been very difficult to find.  The chest does compliment well in our living room, and hides the fact that it is a toy chest.",4
2916,"We enjoyed the first towel we purchased, I went back to order more. The towel is made well and use quality materials. I recommend this product.",5
2917,"this ball is wonderful!!  It makes a wonderful sound when you shake it, and really gets my son's attention. I'm using it to help him track and the soft plastic makes it easy for him to chew, plus its light so he can grab it and swing it around.",5
2918,"Easy to handle. My baby loves to play with the ball. It is a well build toy, colorfull, entertaining and fun.",4
2919,"These are a great alternative to the Halo sleep sacks - slightly more affordable and lighter weight, so great for the summer.  My favorite feature is that the zipper zips both ways - great for late night diaper changes!",5
2920,"I have this sleep sack and several cotton halo brand sacks. This sleepsack is quite thin like a tshirt. Thus even over footed jammies I worry about her being cold particularly given that the parents are under a comforter. It means that we keep the bedroom warmer than is comfortable for us (about69). The solid color halo sacks are a thicker cotton fir which I think 67 degrees is ok when over footed jammies.However the zipper design on the summer sack is far superior. It zips both ways. Thus you can zip it all the way open top to bottom to get baby in or out or you can unzip just the bottom for a diaper change or to keep baby cool in the early warm part of evening (I like to leave the bottom open and then zip it later when the room cools off, without waking baby) . And you don't have to thread thezipper. With halo you have to &#34;start &#34; thezipper like on a sweatshirt which can be hard in low light with a wriggling baby. Halo does allowopen the bottom forndiaper change.",4
2921,"love it and glad i bought these lids. I used it after pumping to have bottle ready at nightstand, to store breastmilk in fridge, also to mix formula in bottle (since nipples sometimes leak when shaking), and even on the go to have water ready and secured tight in bottles for formula mixing. good accessory to have on hand if you plan on using tommee tippee bottles.",5
2922,"I don't know why I didn't buy these earlier. My nanny has arthritis and trying to get the lid that comes with the Tommee Tippee bottles is impossible for her. I just close it with this, which she can then twist off easier, than she can just put the nipple on when she's ready to feed.",5
2923,"Lids are lids, nothing special about these. They fit the Tommee Tippee bottles as they are meant to. Never had any issues with them.",5
2924,"Our favorite car seat and you can't beat it for the price!  We have 1 for each of our boys!  I love that this seat grows with them and is very comfortable especially since my 1st son is a big boy!  He fits so nicely!  I would recommend to anyone in the market for a car seat!",5
2925,"This is really a time saver. Its a lot better than the ones at walmart that's difficult to screw and snap back together.",5
2926,"Best diaper bag purchase I've made thus far.  I love the no mess pour spout.  I can make my LO's bottles quickly without making a mess.  I pre-measure 2 oz worth of baby dry formula in the first two containers and 4 oz on the last bigger container.  I sometimes use the bottom container to store a pacifier.",5
2927,"nice funnel top but the other sections don't connect well. i wouldn't get this again because it's easier to carry formula in those snap on lid long cylindrical bottles.",2
2928,"A must have!  It is nearly impossible to trim a baby's nails with regular clippers.  These are so incredibly easy to use.",5
2929,"i had a couple of the regular baby nail clippers and I find them so hard to use w/out accidentally hurting your baby.  This is so much easier to control and I love them.  My son wouldn't let me cut his nails so I started letting him hold the cover while I cut his nails as a distraction and now he won't let me not give the cover to him.",5
2930,"This thing is ingenious. Before I used this, I was just putting formula in snack bags. Huge mess when trying to get it in the bottle. I would be covered in formula. The funnel stops any spillage and you can easily empty it of all formula. The shape of it allows it to easily slip into the side pocket. You do need 2 hands to unscrew it and so forth, but I've never really had a problem with that. Cute, easy to wash, works well. Highly recommend.",5
2931,"Our 3-month old son began sleeping in this sleeper the very night we brought him home from the hospital. The incline of the sleeper helps tremendously with his reflux, enabling him to sleep through the night comfortably and without any issues...but he has become so accustomed to it that he is unable to sleep on flat surfaces - like in his crib. However, for now I keep this sleeper on my side of the bed where it is easy to keep an eye on him through the night and to conveniently pick him up for nighttime feedings and diaper changes. The rocking motion is a nice addition to the sleeper, and oftentime works in relaxing our baby to sleep - although it would be nicer as an automatic feature instead of a manual one. Still, we are very pleased with this sleeper.",5
2932,"The music has 2 different volume settings which is a nice feature. Don't be misled by the pictures though, it is NOT clear unless it's within a foot or two of the wall/ceiling. My son still loves it, he's watched it since he was 6mos and is a year old now. He looks for it when we go to bed and likes to tote it around by the handle. The slides store in a handy slot in the back, but beware- if your tot likes to drag it around they are bound to get lost because they don't stay in very good. I would totally buy this again, I turn it on when I nurse him at night and the music is soothing (and on a convenient timer, so you don't have to shut it off). Batteries last a long time too.",4
2933,"My daughter loves this lovey.  She chews/sucks on the &#34;ears&#34; while playing and rubs the soft blanket part when she's trying to go to sleep.",5
2934,"This is my go-to wet bag to keep in my diaper bag.  It can easily hold 3-4 cloth diapers and wipes.",4
2935,"My son loves this table.  His favorite part is putting the balls into the hole and watching them fall out.  Some of the stickers have already peeled off but I caught them before my son could eat them.  I wish the legs had a bit more weight to them, when my son leans up against the table, it tends to move away from him even on carpet.  That's not a good thing if a child can't stand on their own yet.  We would brace one side of the table against our coffee table until my son could stand on his own.Proslots to do, ball feature is a big bonus, flashing lights, bilingual, music is acceptableConsnot weighted well in the legs for younger toddlersSome stickers can be removed easily",4
2936,"Ok, the first use was difficult because it took me a while to figure out how to get it to fit my Bob stroller properly EVEN though it came with easy directions.  This rain cover is a little tight, so I played with it for a good 15 minutes before I figured out how it settled onto my Bob Stroller.  Once it was on there and I took it jogging in the rain with my son, it worked great.  No leakage, no problems, no fogginess or condensation.  I have since taken it on quite a few rainy-day jogs and it has been great.  It did the job just fine.  I have no complaints other than it is a little tight to put on each time.  But now that I know it's quirks, I know exactly how to manipulate it into proper position quickly and efficiently so I can get out there and jog. :)  I'm happy with it and GLAD I have it!",4
2937,"I have gone through about 15 strollers since my baby was born. This was by far, the best stroller we have ever had. It was inexpensive, lightweight, easy to open and close, as well as fit in my trunk without taking up all the space. It maneuvered around stores easily, being able to might tight turns or fit between racks. I loved being able to take the baby out of the car, still in the carseat and lightly place him in this. If I was careful, the click sound it makes to tell you it is secure wouldn't even wake him him.My only complaint is that I wish they made something similar for bigger kids. None of the other strollers met all my needs like this one did. They are expensive, heavy, hard to open, or really big. I even liked this stroller better than the $800 Uppababy I bought (which is a nightmare stroller --- why do all the rich people like it??)",5
2938,"I received this as a shower gift and have used it for two months. We recently took it on a plane trip. We also own a BOB with the infant adapter. I prefer this Caddy when it is just me running errands (and I need cargo/cannot babywear) but on long strolls to the zoo or similar I might opt for the BOB. The wheels on the Caddy are squeaky and if there is any uneven terrain Baby gets what I call a Stroller Massage. We live in the city and there is a lot of uneven pavement so I think that Baby enjoys the shocks of the BOB. However, getting through doorways is so much easier in the Caddy.I'm glad we have both options. The Caddy definitely has benefits for short walks. It is easy to collapse, it is lightweight, has a huge storage basket and stands when folded. Great for when we walk to restaurants.The only improvement that could be made is to the parent console. The drink holders are shallow. It would be better if the holders were mesh/fabric to allow for additional depth...no current smartphone fits in the drink holder or compartment.The Caddy survived the plane trip and was the best choice. I could not imagine trying to bring a heavier stroller through an airport.I also tested out the Liteway Plus to go with our car seat. This Caddy is definitely the right choice for our family. I am not sure that it would survive another child but I think it will hold up for 6 months, when we would upgrade to a sit-up stroller.",5
2939,"The only downside to this is the center has no cushion.  We purchased a separate pad to put under it.  My granddaughter loves it.She has spilled and written on the cover and we throw it in the washing machine and it comes out brand new.  We have been using it for almost 2 yrs. and it still looks brand new.",4
2940,"My baby loves this feeder, it is eas to wash and keep clean",5
2941,"Our son is addicted to these!  If we are feeding him something that he isn't crazy about we can just put it in this and he eats it.  I would recommend buying 2 so you can trade off with your baby, they can be eating out of one while you fill the other.",5
2942,"I really like this feeder. It is easy to clean and much neater than the mesh bag feeders. I like that it has a case too!",5
2943,"Our little girl loves this handy feeder - especially since she is teething. She loves nectarines and pears, but they're hard to pick up, so with this feeder we can easily cut them up and put them inside so she can chew away to her heart's content.  The only thing I don't like is the size... this is the Large size, but it's really not all that big.  I wish there was a bigger size (or maybe there is and I missed it?). As far as cleaning goes, though - much better than the mesh feeders!!",4
2944,"I used this feeder when my daughter was 8 months to 12 months. After that, I could trust her to hold the fruit directly. It was great though. Fruit pops in and she chomps on it.",4
2945,"My grandbaby is teething so my daughter put a piece of cold apple in and the baby took to this like a pro. The cold helped numbher gums and she loved che wing the nipple and getting the juice and mashed apple out.",5
2946,"We didn't feel comfortable starting our 5.5 mo old on true BLW-size foods, so we got a Kidsme instead. He's used it with avocado and banana and eagerly holds it himself. He's very proud of his ability to feed himself and participate in mealtime. It doesn't make nearly as much of a mess as purees, and takes only a few minutes to prep and clean.Get the large, it's not very big. I can't imagine a baby old enough for solids would get much use out of the small.",5
2947,"This is wonderful for putting ice in it and allowing my daughter to use it for teething.  And, I think it would be wonderful for other foods as well.  But, I used it one time with orange tangerines and it won't lose the ugly orange tint.  The ability to maintain it's clean look was one of the reasons I purchased it.",3
2948,"My baby has great time eating fruits with this feeder. Easy to clean and store. Is a great way to get your baby used with textured food.",5
2949,"I bought this in one of my attempts to get my kids off of pacifiers and give them relief for their molars. They will occasionally chew on it if I hand it to them while changing their diapers but then they toss it on the ground. Where any piece of lint or stray dog hair promptly sticks to it. I thought they would love this since they love brushing their teeth but nope.",1
2950,"My baby loves this thing. I guess it's the little bristles against her gums. Yes, if you throw it around, it attracts fuzzies and stuff because it's silicon. But it's easy to wash. And it's durable.",5
2951,"I got this for the new baby, i hope she likes it. I had one for my son he loved it while he could use it.",3
2952,"Looks just like described. But my baby don't like it. It's too big for his mouth. He is 5 month old.",2
2953,"he absolutely loves this teether and I love that it is not plastic! The bristles are great for his front teeth. it's just a little gross that his saliva gets stuck in the bristles so you do need to clean this often",4
2954,"I had a feb baby and the center where I gave birth required a car seat cover. I decided based on reviews that this is what I was looking for. Without taking it off it was hard to get the baby in and out but it kept the baby nice and warm. It worked perfectly for trips outdoors and my daughter loved being tucked away on walks. It kept the wind, rain and snow out but if it was slightly warm I found that it got too hot even with it open. Being able to unzip it  was a nice feature for when we went in doors from outside and I loved the extra blanket layer. I used a different brand for my first daughter and I preferred this one so much more.",5
2955,"Even though officially techs say all car seats are equally safe and all pass the same official safety tests, I got the Britax Advocate because I read other independent safety reviews and it looked comfortable and cushioned. After using it for around a year (my son is now 2 years old and still rear facing) I can say that it is, in general, a very good seat.  HOWEVER: It does not allow for extended rear facing in general (my son is thankfully not tall) which is the safe option (children should rear face until 4 years old for safety, this is science-based).  It is not the most comfortable option for rear facing as it makes the toddler sit more crunched, not enough leg space and the sides are high so he feels kind of cowered in the seat.  It is certainly not his favourite and he often prefers to ride in his father's car where he uses a Diono Radian (also rear facing) and its much more comfortable for him and also to get him in and out of the car.  Also, the side protection foam has broken very easily just from getting him in and out of the seat.  Overall it is a good seat but i would go with another option if I were to purchase a seat again.",3
2956,"This is a beast.  It is two to three times as heavy as a normal car seat.  But it has a slim profile so works well when rear leg room is nil.  One problem, use a towel under it, a screw on the bottom tore my leather seat a little.  Be sure to check the weight rating for your vehicle's latch connectors because this and an older child likely mean you must secure it with the seat belt.",4
2957,"I'm giving this 3 stars although I truly believe that it deserves 3 1/2. The reason why I chose to give this 3 1/2 stars because although it truly is the ONLY carseat that can fit 3 across (believe me, I've looked for one since I found out I was pregnant), it is very heavy, does not have a lot of support for babies (my 11 month old looks slouched and leans to the right), and the most disturbing for me is that in rear-facing mode in order to tighten the seat belt I have to pull the straps from the back and then use the tightening strap from the front.I spoke to customer service regarding the fact that I have to pull the straps from the back and she said that it was perfectly normal. This is the first time I have ever needed to pull the strap from the back in order to tighten a seat belt. I have 2 older children and then my 11 month old and have had a Britax, Graco, Chicco, and finally this Diono between them and this was a first for me and really concerned me. She mentioned that you have to &#34;pull, pull, pull&#34; in order to tighten the strap. I did that, but it didn't work. She also mentioned that it could be because its rearfacing and the angle that at the angle I was pulling in was not correct because with Diono carseats you have to pull down to tighten the straps. She said to try it out forward facing, which I honestly have not done because it is fairly heavy and is in between 2 Clek boosters that are latched in and with my daughter not being anywhere close to forward facing I guess I'm too lazy to try it out. She did say that I could call back if it still didn't work. She also offered free of charge to send me a support pad for my daughter and I do appreciate that! Thank you, Annette!Pros:Really does fit 3 across - for me Passenger side Clek Booster, Middle- Diono, Driver Side Clek BoosterSoft materialLooks SleekGREAT customer serviceCons:Heavy, although you can travel with it I doubt you would because it is so heavy it would kill your back. I have my older Britax that I will take with the Go-Go Babyz Travelmate (so amazing!)Straps need to be pulled from the back while Rear-facingBaby is slouched. If I could go back I'd spend a little more and get the RXT with the headwings. I am thinking of just biting the bullet and buying that. I'm waiting for the support pad and if it seems like it doesn't help will go ahead and buy the RXT and sell my Diono on craigslist.In conclusion, I'm still glad I bought it. There would be no way I could get three kids in one row on my Honda Pilot 2007 without having to buy a new car. If I could go back, I'd buy the RXT. I hope this helps!",3
2958,"We just got this seat yesterday and judging by the few low-star comments I was expecting a nightmare of an installation. It was actually really easy for me and took about 5 minutes. I think people get a confused because there are a few different installation set ups, but you just have to follow the instructions for the one you are doing and ignore the rest.I primarily bought this seat in this color because they do not use flame retardants on the cover. It does have that typical &#34;chemical&#34; smell to it from the packaging and foam inside, but I feel like a lot of that will come off when I wash it. The material is soft and cozy and,  yes, the seat is huge, but that's to be expected for a car seat that can turn into a booster and hold 100lbs. We can not fit it rear-facing behind the driver's seat of our mid-sized SUV, and I am only about 5'8. The passenger seat does have to be moved up quite a bit to fit it in, but my wife is small so it's not a big deal. I can see that it would be hard for an average or large sized person to fit in the passenger seat with the car seat rear-facing behind it. It'll fit much nicer once baby is old enough to be forward facing and would also probably fit better rear-facing in a large SUV or mini-van.",4
2959,"This car seat came highly recommended by a friend who was in a bad accident and her baby was completely fine. We like how it folds up and is easy to travel with. Baby is comfortable and regularly dozes off in it!",5
2960,"We got this because it isn't as wide, but were pleasantly surprised to see how strong with car seat is. It doesn't feel like cheap plastic; it is heavy duty with metal and a solid frame. The only complaint is that it isn't as comfortable for long drives, and the tightening strap needs to be pulled straight down, not down and out at a natural 45 degree angle.",4
2961,"Cons: Does everything have to come with a chemical smell??? I am tired of having to air out my purchases and washing them before I can use them. Of course it is made in China.Rear facing requires a bit of room in your car and I have it in the middle and in a SUV. I wouldn't use this as an infant seat, but for every step after that.Pros: narrow when in the front facing direction.Takes care of all seat needs for a long time.",3
2962,"I couldn't be happier. It's a bit bulky for our elantra, but this thing just looks and feels safe!! Baby loves it much more than her old one. It's a little heavy, but I transfer it every day from car to car when I drop her off with grandma. Super easy install and set up! Takes me less than a minute to get it from car to car.",5
2963,"This seat is great! it has so many options for continued use as baby/toddler grown,  and is heaver than cheaper models by 3x at least. It's just a solid seat. I love its narrow profile, so I don't take up two seats with just the one car seat.",5
2964,"Tough to zip up but that's the point --- the carseat is super snug in the bag.  If only it made the carseat lighter to carry!  ha!  I do appreciate the &#34;backpack&#34; style carrying option, which is really the only way to muscle it around while traveling with a toddler in a stroller (as everyone who is bringing this carseat along is).  Only wish the backpack straps could tighten more, as it sagged on my back even in the tightest setting, forcing me to lean waaaay forward to manage it.  Even so, a great purchase.",5
2965,"I put this car storage on the floor in the back seat area of my Honda CR-V.  I use it to hold my two year old daughter's toys and books.  Currently, it has 5 books, toy phone, three small animals, toy tablet, and a pair of sunglasses in one of the side pockets.  It is a great tool to keep the car clean from having toys/books spread all over the floor and underneath the seats.  I would highly recommend.",5
2966,"I think this is going to work perfectly in my car, which is currently a disaster area with toys and fruit snack wrappers and snack containers all over the place.The one thing I don't like is how smelly this was as soon as I took it out of the box.  It's a really awful smell and we're currently airing the thing out, hoping it'll go away.",4
2967,"This has been a favorite of Little Man's since he could grasp.  Now 5 months, he shakes, bangs and eats it regularly.  It's been through the dishwasher multiple times and has entertained him for as much as 20 minutes at one time!  This is the rattle that started him scooting on the floor!!  I would definitely recommend this as a gift for any newbie!!",5
2968,"My teething baby loves these.  Each tab has a different texture and the big handle allows him to grab on it.  I also like that I can tie it on to his cart cover, stroller, car seat, etc.",5
2969,"It's a sturdy stroller that I would recommend for newborns to be in. Many function options where it can be used as a bassinet. We did purchase a lighter uppababy for travel though",5
2970,"My wife and I LOVE those! My baby girl is 2.5mo now. She still doesn't care much about the rings, but they're very useful for hanging her toys and secure other rings in place. Our baby is just starting to notice how beautiful the rings are, hopefully, she'll start grabbing them soon. The Sassy rings have been made with high quality and with great details. They're so educational and fun. We recommend this for all.",5
2971,"I bought a bunch of these for Fathers Day and all the men absolutely loved them!  We put a pic of our newborn in it and they went over really well.  They are really high quality frames, and at a really great price.",5
2972,"I have no complaints..... This was a perfect gift for my son to display his love for his newborn son. I would recommend this product to everyone...",5
2973,"Bought for my teething baby. She seems to enjoy it. Easy for her to hold. Safe silicone and not the bad plastic.Easy to clean and convenient to attatch to her travel rings so we can attach to her carseat and jumper.",4
2974,"My 6-month old loves these & they are easy for him to grasp. Scores way above many other teethers, including the ones you can put in the fridge.",5
2975,"These have held up well.  My 22 mo olds still plays with it and chews on it.  Easy to wash and even wear as a bracelet when  baby is really teething.  Love the colors.",5
2976,"My daughter loves these. The different textures amuse her as I watch her rotate and try each one. Easy to clean.",5
2977,"I got these for my daughter, not because she particularly needed a new teether, but because at 7/8 months, she was gagging every time I tried to give her food with any texture to it and I was worried it was a sensory issue.  I can't say for sure that these teethers solved the problem - maybe it was coincidence - but soon after she started using them, she had a much easier time accepting solid foods.",5
2978,"Granddaughter's favorite. It is easy to grip and attach to links and very soothing for her to chew and play with.",5
2979,"The different ridges and textures on the ring provide comfort and soothe the gums.  Its easy to sterilize and clean.  The colors are appealing to my child.  Easy to carry in a diaper bag and good price!!",4
2980,"These were the first two teethers we bought for our babies.  We selected this brand because these are made in the USA.  They use medical grade silicone.  They are dishwasher safe and can be frozen.  Not all silicone teethers can be frozen.  I especially enjoy that I could buy these in neutral colors AND that they came in a pack of two with two different colors because I have TWINS!  - Teethers are certainly something a M.O.M. needs two of...",5
2981,"Just an FYI for anyone else with a textured tub...this mat won't work.  And it's a shame because otherwise it's great.  I just wanted a little surface for my 1-year-old to sit on so she would feel more stable in the tub, and this was a great size for that.  It won't stick in our tub, but I'm keeping it for future use in another tub or large sink, if need be.",4
2982,"I am not sure why people complain about thie mat. It works just fine with our bathtub and i had no issues with it.",5
2983,"My baby is 8-9 months old and instantly loved this toy. I keep the legs off for now because she is just crawling and learning to pull up, but they snap on and off super easily compared to other toys we have had to assemble. Even though the legs detach easily, they are still sturdy to hold up against the weight of a baby when they lean on it. There aren't grippers or rubber on the bottom of the feet, however, which in my opinion is needed when you have wood floors like we do (maybe the manufacturer would consider adding them to future models) to help prevent skidding. I will probably glue some rubber stoppers to the bottoms eventually or keep this on her play mat that is slightly rubberized. It plays TONS of songs with languages in English, French and Spanish. I saw previous reviews that babies were getting their fingers stuck in the flipper but it seems the manufacturer has corrected the spacing issue because I inspected this thoroughly before letting baby play with it and I do not see any spaces large enough for baby to stick her fingers in ( and she flips the flipper back and forth constantly). There are two levels to adjust for loudness. I would recommend this to friends, family, or a stranger I saw looking at it in the store without hesitation. Just be forewarned: Your house will never be quiet again once you start buying electronic toys for the kiddies! LOL. They do love this toy though so it is worth it to watch them learn and explore.",5
2984,"These are really cute looking but I don't know that they serve too much of a purpose. Everything I out on it falls off except if I put nipples on the white middle pieces. But that means I'm drying 3 nipples only... I guess therefore they do serve a purpose (cute and somewhat saving space) but just a small one.",2
2985,"these are very flimsy and really don't hold anything. I took them off my grass and use the grass by itself.  not a very well thought of product",1
2986,"Provides additional space for drying the nipples and rings for all the bottles that we go through during the course of a normal day. Works great with the lawn to get the smaller pieces up in the air so that everything dries quickly.",5
2987,"What a cute way to dry baby bottles & nipples!  I love this little flower for my Boon drying rack.  It is way nicer to look at than a regular drying rack and works well.",5
2988,"It's cute and stays standing up just fine, but there's got to be a better solution for drying nipples.  You need something to go with the &#34;grass&#34; to hang nipples to dry on, but this is not the ideal set-up.  The angle and length of theses &#34;branches&#34; allow nipples to fall off too easily if you can even get them hanging in the first place.  For other items that have holes that the branches fit through (like pacifiers and the Dr. Brown's mini brush), it's great.",4
2989,"This a great addition to the drying rack.  I use it the most for medicine syringes and those pesky straws from sippy cups.  It works well for medicine cups and the cleaning devices I use for the sippy cup straws.  Over all it's worth the couple of bucks to add this to the drying rack because it's efficient and useful.",5
2990,"Recently saw this product available in-store as well, but first time I saw it was here, online.  This is a drying rack &#34;tree&#34; that attaches fairly loosely to the Grass/Lawn drying rack base by sort-of grabbing a few of the spikes of grass with the hollow base.  I like this.  We use it to dry breast pump valves, and to hang things like pacifiers to dry.  We use this and the Lawn base (and another flower accessory) multiple times daily.Pros:  Functional, but cute.  Can be placed anywhere on the grass lawn drying rack base.Cons:  The base doesn't grab the grass spikes with a great amount of force.  Any time I use this drying tree, I have to push it down onto the grass again.  I haven't had it topple over yet, but it always feels as if it may fall off.  I think if there were multiple pre-selected places for this to attach, they could have included tabs on the base of this tree which would snap securely into place to guarantee that the tree will not topple over.",5
2991,"These are the best pacis I've found.  They're one piece, so I feel safe giving them to the baby.  They also stay in way better than the round ones from the hospital.  And I run them through the dishwasher on &#34;sanitize&#34; to clean them.  No issues there.  Great price.",5
2992,"Got a few of these to add to my existing DXR-5 system.  I would say it's a good value for a video monitor with basic features and works pretty well,The only design flaw I see so far is that the cameras have on/off switches.  These are not-battery powered so a power cord is required.  So WHY would you need any sort of power switch?  If you are paranoid that big brother is watching then unplug the cord.  The only reason I can see that they designed this with a momentary power switch is to annoy you when the power goes out during the night, power comes back on but the cameras will not turn on until you go into your sleeping kids' rooms and press the dumb buttons.  Whomever field tested this idea needs an early retirement.The add-on cameras do not come with the camera stand that is included with the full kit.  Bummer since the stands are great for mounting to the walls with a few modifications.",3
2993,"We had an existing video monitor, but with having more kids needed additional monitors and tried this model due to some of its unique features.What's so great about it:- Supports up to 4 cameras from one receiver, provides unified system for monitoring multiple kids in different rooms.- Has a silence feature where the monitor audio/video turns off when there is no activity, but turns on when there is noise.  This prevents the constant white noise while you try to sleep (like other monitors do).- Inexpensive compared to many alternatives.What's not so great:- When using less than 4 cameras, you have to scroll through the &#34;empty&#34; channels each time you want to rotate through the cameras.- Silence feature doesn't reliably turn back on- Night vision viewable distance is pretty short, unless your rooms are small you will need a night-light on in the room to see anything.- Battery in receiver stopped holding charge after 1 year- VERY poor quality on the power cables, they simply stop providing power due to small breaks in the wire in the cable - I have had to repair, replace two of them in 2 years.  For plugs which mostly remain in the same spot with occasional relocation, this is pretty bad.Summary:It worked well enough for us when our kids were babies, but once they got older the longevity of this product became an issue.",3
2994,"I have both this and the boppy and this is by far the best!  The strap is the key because my daughter doesn't slip down between the pillow and me like the boppy does.  Plus the pocket is helpful.  I do wish the fabric had a waterproof layer on it but other than that, it's great!",5
2995,"If you plan on using formula at all this thing is genius. I wish I had known about it with my first daughter. Have had zero issues with it. Been using it about 4 months now. Worth every penny and I will be buying this for baby gifts! Every momma needs this convenient option. Nod it's cute so it's okay to leave on the kitchen counter all the time! ;)",5
2996,"I really wanted to like this and to use it more. I just can't use it comfortably. It holds my baby up against my breasts and I am sore from breastfeeding him so I can not really use it! I am hoping that in the future I will be able to. I am able to use a sling easier.",3
2997,"LOVE Boba! It has improved upon the basic m*by wrap concept with stretchier fabric that makes it easy to adjust properly. More comfortable on your shoulders, and requires less readjusting as the day goes on. I do not agree with the manufacturer's note that this last to 18 months, however. After 15-16 pounds our baby sagged heavily and we switched to a more sturdy carrier.",5
2998,"I love my Boba. People are constantly asking me where I got it.Since the carry is the same no matter the age or size, I had to learn to adjust when breast feeding in the wrap. But now, at almost 8 months... My little one discreetly feeds like a champ in the standard carry. Any time we are out of the house for an extended time frame where I expect my daughter to eat, I bring my Boba so she can comfortably eat wherever we are.I had a buckle and strap style carrier with my oldest and I was always sore from the straps... With the Boba, you don't even know you're wearing it. You know, besides having your baby in front of you. :)",5
2999,"We used this one time when my son came home from the hospital and that was it. I found it to be wayyyy too long, too difficult and frustrating to put on while baby is crying, etc. we use the ergo now all the time since he's older and more interested in being awake and carried around. For us, the wrap carrier was just a total waste of money.",1
3000,"I wish I bought this earlier. I purchased this when baby was 2 months because I was getting tired if carrying him and was getting carpel tunnel syndrome! I also was stuck on the couch or bed so I wouldn't wake him. This wrap gives you the closeness that baby needs. Read the directions and watch the YouTube video and it's easy to put on from there.It can get hot but no hotter than the other baby carriers. I dont feel it's the most supportive. I still support his butt or head when I feel he needs it.Overall still a great product",4
3001,"This wrap is wonderful for a newborn or very young baby. As they get older and want to wiggle more I find myself using other carriers. I watched the how to video on youtube a million times and you get the hang of it very quickly. My baby slept in this thing often and felt very snug and secure. It's a very comfortable wrap too. My husband is a big man and he can use it too, while the ergo is a bit constricting for him. Two thumbs way up. Will definitely use it with our next little bundle.",5
3002,"My daughter is nine months old and we love using this for quick trips.  I recently started wearing her on the back and it is great.  Her weight is distributed well.  We used this while at Universal and short hikes.  I was able to feed her in it without calling any attention.  We could wear her for hours without feeling tired.  I am also 5'1/petite and my husband is 6'0/bulk and this adjusts easily for both our heights and body types which I've heard other carriers don't.  I love the straps that make sure my handbag doesn't slip off.  The pocket in the front is a little useless for me.  I really don't see how you can fit anything in it when the cover is rolled up inside.  I also had a hard time using it when my baby was a newborn.  I did use it, but not very often.  It comes with a newborn support, but I didn't really like it.  I've read the newer models have improved this feature.  Overall, I love it.",5
3003,"I bought this to go on a tricycle that didn't have a cup holder. I keep it in my car trunk because I also use it on the stroller too",5
3004,"The clamp that attaches to the stroller has rubber pads which compress a little when used, but not enough to keep the holder stable on round bars. A little weight or bump will tilt it if installed on round bars; actual use by a kid makes it a pretty haphazard thing to use. The cups themselves are disappointing too: The blue cup sits loosely in the shallow side so it's easy to knock out (or for the kid to take out) and its guard(?) pops off with any use whatsoever; the deeper cup for drinks has little flaps that, once shoved downwards (in use), pretty much stay down and therefore are useless. Maybe mine is just defective, but it's more than just one problem so I doubt it.However, if you have a stroller with square bars, ditch the blue cup thing (or at least the top unless it happens to work for you), and use cups that fit pretty snugly, it will work for you. I rate it at two stars because it is sturdy as well as easy/quick to put on and take off as a complete unit and in only removing the cups.",2
3005,"This bowl DOES NOT stick.  My 10 month old is able to pick it up off of any surface without any difficulty.  The little tray that goes into the bowl doesn't click or lock on so it comes out VERY easy and he figured that out within seconds of putting the bowl in front of him.  The silverware is nice.",1
3006,"This is the only placement we use anymore.  It stays in place on the table, which is such a life saver you'll wonder how you did without it before.  It cleans up super easily and is cute to boot.",5
3007,"I have had a meniscus surgery on my knee and both my knees are kind of going down hill from being double jointed and so I really don't like having to kneel for anything, but this has been amazing! It's enough space for me to have both knees on and when I need to readjust and sit down, it's a nice cushion as well! Absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend to anyone with knee problems who have kids!",5
3008,"While this kneeler is certainly cushy and I love the hook for handing it up after bath time, I can't get past how nasty it looks now. The water stains just make it look gross and there's no way to clean it. I wish it were waterproof!",3
3009,"Definitely makes bathing my baby a lot more comfortable.",4
3010,"I like the bassinet feature on this so I can have the baby with me when I'm in the living room and have him in his cradle in the bedroom. The one thing I don't like about the bassinet feature is the fabric that seems to collect every piece of dust that flies through the air.  There aren't any sheets you can buy for this.  I also wish the sheets for the pack n play were sold in stores.  It seems they can only be ordered online.",4
3011,"Good quality pack-n-play. This is our LO's bed since he was about 3 months old. So far we have mostly used the bassinet. The bassinet attachment is sturdy there are no gaps between the included mattress and the mesh sides.  I did not buy an additional mattress, our baby has sleept through the night comfortably since he was 12 weeks old.  I didn't get much use out of the changing pad/infant sleeper, our boy is pretty big.  It is easy to set up and transport, I pack it up with one side of the bassinet attached on each side. It packs up just fine with the bassinet, the bars, and sheet in the included bag.  Giving it 4 stars because it would be nice if the changing pad/napper were easier to remove when using the bassinet.  Great for camping with a little one!  I would recommend it to others.",4
3012,"Fairly easy assembly and break down. Portable and safe which is always a plus. The changing table was a big help, but my baby's already out grown it (she grew like a weed though, it's almost 2 ft long.)you can attach more rings and toys to the overhang and it's a big help to fascinate the baby. :)",5
3013,"Loved it except that it squeaked a lot.  Every time I leaned over the railing to put my daughter in her playard, it squeaked.  There were times where I was trying to put her down for her naptime and she would wake up because as I leaned over the railing (I'm 4'9&#34; so I'm short =P) and it squeaked loudly.  My husband swears he tightened the screws so I don't know why it's squeaking.I am short on space.  This playard wasn't too small or too big.  The napper and changer was nice to have since I couldn't bend over because I had a C-section.",4
3014,"Perfect, the same as the picture. I love it, really easy and really very nice. Buy them, excellent price and quality",5
3015,"Portable bassinet= extra 3-4 hours parents get to nap while child is in there.Changing station= no poop all over the bed.Pack n Play= solid bassinet for baby to sleep at night.  It's easy to assemble, we carry it whenever we travel but we don't bring the changing station as that's not foldable.  Overall, it's great when you have a small place and want to delay buying a huge crib.",5
3016,"The playpen is definitely good quality (compared to others out there). However, the two top parts, the rocker and changer, are not suitable for children after 14 pounds. My child is already 15 pounds, doesn't fit in the rocker, and pushes the changer too far down; I had to remove it. All in all, a good product.",4
3017,"My 7 month old still sleeps in my room in this. It was totally perfect for her. We didn't use the changing table attachment much but we used the little rocker while she was tiny and after a couple months moved her down to the bassinet. Now she's starting to pull up and we've moved her down to the bottom level. the storage thing on the side is mostly just in the way, I don't really use it. We bought a thicker 3 inch mattress to use with it. If you plan to use this full time, you might want to do that. We recently took this on vacation and it folded up very small and took very little room in the minivan and she had no trouble sleeping on the mattress that comes with it for a few nights.",5
3018,"I seriously love this thing.  ONE problem.  They NEED to make an adapter for the changing pad so it doesn't slump.  Seriously. Other than that this is perfect.  I prefer a separate bouncer for our house but for travel having the one that comes with this is very nice.  The pattern is sweet - good for a boy or girl.  And sturdy! I could see this lasting a whilleeeee. So, if irish twins are in your future this thing could see some use ;)",5
3019,"I bought 2-3 packs of this mat to put it in my son's room. Did not want the alphabet number mat everyone has. This fit the bill. It was super easy to put together and helps cushion a wobbly toddler from falling down. Of note, on bare feet, your feet will make these sticker peeling noise when stepping on the mat since mat has texture on the surface this not a smooth surface. Overtime, we did notice that the thickness of the mat sightly decreased and packed down due to it being stepped on a lot.",4
3020,"This is such a cute mobile. It is well made and my baby loves watching it. This mobile has so many more songs than others we've had in the past. The lights are just the right brightness. I also like that this turns into a radio and is able to be used as a toy after the mobile isn't needed. It easily attaches to the crib and hasn't taken off paint like other mobiles in the past.  I deducted one star because it doesn't have an option to turn off all the lights while on. Some times at night, the music would be enough to soothe the baby and the light could be too bright. I really like the mobile overall the best compared to all others we've had. And the price is great!",4
3021,"I love this mobile. My son loves this mobile. My only issue is that even on the lowest setting, the volume of the music is ridiculously loud. When my son was an infant, I solved the problem by covering both speakers with a piece of duct tape. Now that he is sitting, I would be afraid that he'd be able to peel the duct tape off and get himself into trouble, so I detached the upper mobile and removed the lower unit from his crib, setting it on his dresser instead. He can still listen to the music and I can feel comfortable leaving the duct tape over the speakers.",4
3022,"These spoons are great for starting your baby on solids. They are gentle on gums and small enough to fit into baby's sometimes hesitant mouth. I used these exclusively for my son when he was 4 - 8 months. When he learned to take bigger bites, I transitioned him to larger spoons. The &#34;hard&#34; side if the spoon was never useful to me. So my advice is get these, but you will only need one pair.",4
3023,"This tub was perfect for us after our daughter outgrew the sink, yet wasn't big enough to sit in the tub.  We put the whole thing in the tub or used it on the floor (though that was obviously messier).  I absolutely loved how it folded up and could hang on the bathroom door, as we are short on space.  The only complaint is that the bottom is pretty slick.  We had to sit/lay our daughter on a washcloth to make her a bit more secure.",4
3024,"I love this. It holds my Graco snugride (for my two month old) and allows my 2 year old to ride comfortably. You have to access the basket from the sides (or small opening between two seats, but it's not practical), which isn't a big deal. My older daughter loves this. She enjoys the freedom.",5
3025,"I bought this in 2012 to use for a 2-year-old and an infant. I like it, but probably wouldn't buy it again.Pros: tons of different seating options, Graco car seat is very easy to &#34;click&#34; in, stroller folds up super fast and easily, standing platform is very sturdy, 2 canopies to shade both kiddos, child's tray and parent's tray are very useful, 5-point harnesses for front seat and jump seat, pattern is nice for girls or boys, storage basket is large.Cons: the brake is at a terrible position and I'm constantly kicking it, front seat is very shallow, fits into our mini-van...just barely, heavier than our last double stroller, jump seat is a bit difficult to get in and out of the stroller, stroller basket is difficult to access.Overall, it's ok. We've used a regular Graco double stroller in the past and loved it. I wanted to try something different this time around, and wasn't super impressed.Click here to see it at Amazon:Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, OasisUpdate: June 2014We've now had this stroller for 1.5 years. It's still in great shape but because of the above-listed cons I prefer using a single Graco stroller.",3
3026,"I bought this because it was cheaper than other strollers and it went with my Graco car seat. If you really plan on putting 2 kids in here get ready for a work out. It was the worst experience going out with this with my toddler and newborn both in it, When I came to places like raised curbs or high curbs I could barely lift the thing an inch and had to take my toddler out before moving it again. I am not rich and now I have no choice but to use this because I cant afford to spend money on another one!",1
3027,"I love that both my kids will be able to sit in this stroller, but because I have a two month old unable to balance her head I am a little hesitant to put her where she is suppose to sit. However, this stroller is way huge when it's folded up, but overall I like that I don't have to buy two strollers (even though I do have one previously from when my eldest daughter was born). Can't wait to try it out.",4
3028,"This didn't really work too great for elevating my belly as I was sleeping on my side, but this does work great in the baby's cradle to keep him slightly elevated.  He doesn't like to sleep on a flat surface and likes being slightly elevated, so this is such a slight incline that it works nice.  I do wish it was a little wider to fit all the way across the cradle though.  It would probably fit better in a bassinet.",4
3029,"This wedge pillow is perfect for my HUGE pregnancy belly, I wish I had bought it since the very first day of pregnancy because it really had help me a lot. Also I am willing to use it as a wedge under the bassinet's mattress for helping baby avoid any sort of heartburn.",5
3030,"Perfect for pregnant mommies! Being pregnant with twins, I had a lot of back and hip pain. This pillow relieved a lot of pressure and made things bearable and allowed my to sleep. Just a body pillow or pregnancy pillow was not enough, I needed 'bump support' and this pillow did a great job. I just wish I had bought it sooner.",5
3031,"I love these clips- we kept losing pacifiers until I found these- I wash them with clothes etc so they are super easy.",5
3032,"there were mixed reviews regarding the clip, but I like it, especially since my son puts everything in his mouth!  So far it holds well to his clothes or bib.",4
3033,"We purchased this car seat for our son when we purchased a new car. The leather matches our car perfectly. The materials are all very nice and the seat seems sturdy and well made. The install was easy and our son is comfortable in his new seat. We're so pleased with this purchase!",5
3034,"I should have gone with my gut and bought Britax seats. I've used Britax for all of my children and needed two more seats for my infant twins. No matter what you do, no matter how tight you try to get the seat, it wiggles around. My Britax seats NEVER did that. The angle of the pull straps for the latch system makes it nearly impossible to get a tight fit. I've used towel and pool noodles, and nothing helps.  I like that the fabric is soft, and I like the style, but that's about it. Also, like Britax, the straps twist ALL THE TIME.Just my opinion, but keep these points in mind when buying this seat.",2
3035,"It's big and bulky, but I'm okay with that because it feels sturdy.  It's hard to install, but that's fine because it means it's safe.  What got me is that it never sat securely.  I've had 5 children and only my Gracos have ever wobbled.  So today after cleaning out the car I downloaded the manual to see if there were more hidden legs or something.  The problem is that the little ""level"" ball on the seat never really sat in the safe zone if the seat was secure.  Graco's solution?  Roll up a towel and tuck it underneath the seat.  What?  No joke.  Page fifteen of their user manual has a picture of a towel!  How about adding some more legs?  Sheesh.  I won't buy another Graco if that's how they roll.",3
3036,"We loved everything about this car seat until we had to install it in the car. Maybe we got a lemon because we simply could not get the Latch belts to tighten enough to keep the seat secure when in rear-facing position. We tried it in two cars, with a pool noodle and towel, and in the middle and side seats. No matter how tight we pulled the Latch belts there was still slack and the car seat was able to move 90 degree to the left/right.We own a Britax Marathon and previously owned a Graco Snugride so we're pretty confident when it comes to installing car seats. We keep the Britax Marathon in our primary vehicle, but needed something for shorter rides when using our second car.We called Graco to troubleshoot and they only suggestion they had was to install the the car seat using the seat belts instead of LATCH. We returned the car seat as we felt we were making too many exceptions to make this car seat work and were compromising the safety of our child.It's too bad because we were all pretty excited about the cup holders. We decided to purchase a Britax Roundabout G4 Convertible Car Seat instead.",2
3037,"This seat looks good but it is the hardest  seat to get inside of a car!! It's so hard to tighten it down and it becomes loose easily. It takes 2 people to tighten it down and get it out. You'll be sweating by the time your finished. The instructions are terrible and I never knew if I have the seat in properly or not. Some of us only have one seat and have to change it from car to car. I hate this seat. The buckles are hard to click together. They were recalled and new ones do work better. The harness runs my sons neck to where it's blood red. He refuses to left me add any new pads that I bought to go on them. It's just a headache to go any place!! My husband hates it as much as I do. We are going to invest in another brand.",2
3038,"They are great, easy to clean, and catch everything my son drops.  Love these.  Plus, the button on the bib is strong so not easy for my son to take off (which is the issue I had with the bjorn bibs).",5
3039,"I'm very happy with this bib. It snaps easily, catches food particles and our daughter doesn't try to pull it off. Enjoy!",5
3040,"This bag is much darker than in the photo.  The green is much darker, and the gray-stone color is actually more beige.  I'm not happy with the colors and am sending it back.",2
3041,"This was better than those darn boppy pillows (which I got 3 of from my shower!). I wish i had gotten this sooner. Great for nursing. This just fit my body type better. Im not tny, but not huge, I found the boppy was hard to place around me, it felt awkward and my baby would slip between me and the pillow or roll off the side! This pillow is nice and sturdy, lightweight and fits perfectly on the side or front, whichever you prefer to feed. My baby did outgrow this and im still nursing, but definitely worth it for the few months in the beginning. She is 8 months now and that's why i gave 4 stars not 5 since its too small to still use. I would say she was able to use this up until about 6 months.",4
3042,"So ... these are SLIGHTLY different from the brand new ones that say &#34;Patent XXXXX&#34; on the tag.  These ones say &#34;Patent Pending&#34; and the fit is just slightly different.  It's not a huge deal, and they work fine for me, but while my &#34;new&#34; Fuzzibunz is adjusted one way (e.g. 3rd button hole), these ones would have to adjusted slightly differently (e.g. 2nd button hole) to achieve the same fit.BTW, I do think they'll start to leak after a while if you don't strip them every now and again.  Wash them with a tiny bit of liquid dishwashing detergent in super hot water, then do two wash cycles in super hot water with no detergent.  Then they should work fine again.",4
3043,"Pros:1) The seat is easy to clean, the fabric is waterproof, or plastic texture. It can be easily wiped clean.2) The tray is two layers, one removable and one that clicks in. The top part can be removed by even a little curious baby, less than one year old. We have had some unfortunate spills when the little one gets tired and starts to play with his tray.3) The chair folds nicely, by pressing on the gray buttons on either side of the high chair. Very nice feature for getting it through small doors or storing in a limited living space.Overall I totally recommend this product.",4
3044,"I had this chair in my baby registry at Amazon, just opened the box 2 weeks ago. After 10 min of use my baby's neck was cut from the safety belt!!! Unbelievable!",1
3045,"Easy to use (assemble & break down), compact, easy to clean.  Fits in my RV, my office and my bedroom.  Beautiful pattern.  The only gender specific item I've ever purchased with two children.",5
3046,"Thank god for these. For 12 months I never knew they existed. I am no longer fighting with the stupid car seat straps. Get it for anyone who has a car seat. They will thank you!!",5
3047,"If you have a carseat that doesn't have velcro or magnets to keep the straps out of the way, you're probably used to them tangling everytime.  Get these!!!  They work perfectly on ANY carseat, stroller, etc... and come with an adapter for non-metal buckles as well!",5
3048,"They hold the straps for her convertible seat out of the way, just as intended.  Wish we had bought them when she was a newborn and in her infant seat.",5
3049,"If this would have fit on my oven, I'm sure I would have loved this product. My knobs are on the front of my oven, so there is a protrusion above my oven door. The oven door and stove top need to be flush with each other. I may try installing this on the side of the door, not sure I have clearance from the cabinet to work well. Just keep that in mind when ordering this product.",3
3050,"This was easy to install and it works great. We had to install off center due to &#34;self-cleaning&#34; lock on oven. But it still works great.",5
3051,"The last oven lock we had at our previous home was cheap and worked awful. Our new home has stainless steel appliances and I came across this one. It looks great on the oven, you can barely notice it. I gave a good tug on the oven door, and it did not budge. Make sure the surface is clean, and you will get a good seal with the adhesive. I let it set for a while before tugging at it as well to be sure it was stuck on tight.",5
3052,"used these to keep my 2 year old out of the bedrooms and bathroom when we needed to. She had quickly figured out door knobs so we needed something easy to use for those who had to get in but yet still kept her out. My 9 year old and my husband both don't mind using them. Great deterrent for my 2 year old.",5
3053,"Looks better than most of the other ones out there, and it gets the job done.  Would be nice if there were a way to label the number of ounces, but I guess it wouldn't work with different formulas.",5
3054,"My little one hasn't arrived yet, but from first impressions the seat is of good quality, sturdy, and I love that the base is adjustable to ensure baby is sitting at the proper angle.",4
3055,"good quality but more on the expensive side of newborn diapers. Holds up in wash. very well made. will not fall apart easily",4
3056,"I have a bassinet that have a particular oval shape mini mattres, I was worry that this sheet doesn't fits it but at the end it runs great. I just had to use an elastic band with pliers and it makes it fits better!",5
3057,"I'm not sure why it's so hard to find bassinet sheets like this.  These are super soft and fit our bassinet mattress perfect.",5
3058,"Ours made it less then 6 months before it fell apart. It never was a favorite with our daughters' either. It made the seat harder for them to get on and it slipped off quite a few times. They really disliked the splash guard and one time, I caught my then 3 year old trying to pee facing the back of the potty to avoid it. While it looks cute, it wasn't really that functional for us.",2
3059,"This is so simple.  I just love having it.  We bought 2 for each of our bathrooms.  The seat is like a glossy dense foam (like a Bumbo seat), so it is comfortable to sit on.  It has a few suction cups underneath that keep it from sliding around, and it really does hold it securely in place.  Yet, it is also easy to pick up.  I bought a step stool that our son can use to either put in front of the toilet or the sink.  When he uses the toilet, he puts his own seat on there, pushes the stool up to the toilet, and climbs up!  I don't have to clean out a separate potty, he can just flush the toilet like normal.  For now, he only knows how to pee while sitting, but he knows to hold his boy-parts down and aim it at the water.  The seat has a little lip in the front in case he doesn't hold his parts down far enough and so it blocks him from peeing ON the seat.  However, sometimes pee gets under the blue seat and onto the actual toilet seat, so every once in a while,you gotta pick up the portable seat and wipe the bottom of it with a disinfectant wipe and also the actual toilet seat.  I do not regret having gone with this option rather than a separate potty.  It's so much cleaner and easier for our family.  Also, it makes it easy for us to take him into public bathrooms because is used to only using a normal sized toilet.  We just put the seat protector down and hold him on the seat and he goes potty no problem.",5
3060,"Great for little ones to keep them from getting hurt",5
3061,"These are really essy to install and work great.",5
3062,"Great grovia diaper shell. We absolutely love the hybrid system. The pattern is great and looks good for any gender.",5
3063,"I use a few brands and this one is great for a bib for breakfast time. It has been indespensible for not having mess in the morning all over my girl's daycare clothes. Rushing out in the mornignt o work and daycare, having her not mess her clothes is one less thing to worry about. Love the full coverage smock for all meals. Great for messy spagetti, yogurt and cottage chees when they are just learning to eat on thier own!! Yes, I recommend.",5
3064,"Love it! Now I can keep the stroller in great shape by using this item and washing it instead of taking apart the whole thing! Very comfy too.",5
3065,"I LOVE this pump! Yes, it is louder that most other pumps. But I will gladly trade a loud pump for the comfort! It is so comfortable and there is NO pain or tenderness after pumping. And even though the instructions warned me of an adjustment period for volume pumped, I had no problems or adjustment issues. The first time I used it I pumped 4+ oz off each side in about 5 minutes-which is a little more than what I had produced with the other pumps. I had pumped for my last two kiddos (one exclusive pumper and one half nurse/half pumped) with the Medela Pump In Style Advanced. I liked that I had a great supply with it but pumping was always a bit of a chore and never completely comfortable. With our newest addition, she arrived early like her sisters and I needed to pump more than I really wanted. When my Medela pump died unexpectedly and the pump was over five years old, there was nothing Medela could do. I decided to take a chance on this pump partially because of the price (so much cheaper than replacing my Medela-my insurance will only cover a double electric if my kiddo is readmitted) and partially because I was really interested in this new style of pumping. I am so GLAD I did! I will be telling every new mom I know about this pump because it is awesome!",5
3066,"I take these everywhere. Very easy and works well. My go to wipes for a messy toddler on the go.",5
3067,"I bought four of these, one for each bathroom in our house. They are wonderful and so easy to use. My son just potty trained and he really prefers these over a stand-alone potty for kids. They fit perfect on a standard oval shaped toilet seat. I also have a smaller potty with a circle seat in the kids' room and while this fits on it, it is not a perfect fit bit gets the job done.  I also like the air freshener built in the back.  It is a gentle smell and not overwhelming at all.",5
3068,"It fits my toilet seat, but if you have a squirmy toddler, the potty seat wouldn't stick to the toilet seat quite as well. Maybe this is the case for all potty seats, I don't know. The rubber helps with the adhesion, but not much. Don't get me wrong, it does the job it's supposed to, but there's always room for improvement.  I'm still working on potty training my son and haven't used the Arm & Hammer odour eliminating baking soda yet.",4
3069,"This does the job like it should. It's not my favorite one in the house (we have two), but the kids do like the handles and it's not uncomfortable for them. It fits an oval seat, so be aware that if you have a round seat it will not work as it is not adjustable.",4
3070,"Fits nicely in our toilet seat. I wish the handles had a bit more weight/stability to them.",4
3071,"this is a great seat but be careful if training boys sitting down as it will Shpirts all over the bathroom wall. the front tip is not high enough for boys",5
3072,"We live in a house built in 1961, with two bathrooms.  One bathroom has a regular new toilet that mounts to the floor, the other toilet is an original American Standard wall mount toilet from 1961.  It has a squarish-shaped seat.  I was certain that no potty seat would work with it, but I knew this would work on our new toilet, so I thought at least my son could use it in one bathroom.  Turns out it fits both toilets perfectly!  I was shocked.This seat is nice because it's hard plastic, and so when my son pees all over it (and he does) it is easy to rinse and wipe clean.  The deodorant thing is nice but I doubt I will bother with refills.I almost wasted my money on the Bjorn seat, but I'm glad I went with this one instead.  We have two of the Bjorn potty chairs, and while they are nice, they are nothing special IMO.  This is great and I love the handles.",5
3073,"My husband and I have found this to be one of the handiest things we own. It allows you to get a wipe one-handed, which is a big deal when you are trying to change a poopy, wiggly baby.",5
3074,"I bought two of these dispensers, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  It looks a million times nicer than the plastic wipes packages or tubs! I use them with Honest and Seventh Generation wipes, and they both pop up great. It opens and closes easily, and also wipes clean very nicely.",5
3075,"I'm really surprised how well this works. The dispensers that come with baby wipes never seem to be fully airtight and inevitably allow your wipes to dry out. This thing handily solves that issue. The design is also extremely effective in helping you grab exactly 1 piece of wipe. I have one for baby wipes and one for puppy paw wipes.The only complaint I have are the product sticker labels that come on this. They are EXTREMELY difficult to remove without leaving residue behind. I can't stand when I get leftover sticker labels that I need to scrub or use chemicals to get off. In this case, i worried about damaging the plastic while trying to get the sticker remnants off. Very annoying!",5
3076,"I like this dispenser, definitely better than the ones the wipes come in, but the weight could be better.  I would like to see some sort of track system for it to go into so it stays in place better.",4
3077,"This looks great, and the one-hand open is very helpful with a wriggly baby.  However, the weight that keeps the wipes down doesn't work perfectly with the wipe brand I use.  When I use one hand, sometimes more than one wipe comes through so I have to pull it apart with the other hand, negating the one-hand advantage.  I use Costco's Kirkland wipes.  I have used this with the thinner, lighter, smaller wipes from Up and Up from Target and it worked great.",3
3078,"Keeps your money fresh. Easy to reach for your notes and dispenses notes easily.Good as safe box for no one will know you are using this to store your valuables.",5
3079,"I love it, very nice and practic Wipes Dispenser, excellent item to have when you have kids! i love it",5
3080,"Why did I suffer using those wipe containers that came with the giant packs of wipes ? NEVER AGAIN ! This product is ingenuous ! I press gently and voila the top opens! There is a weight that easily  allows you to grab one wipe at a time ; it also serves as the color indicator on how much wipes you have--definitely helpful ! A must have for all homes that use bathroom and baby wipes!",5
3081,"I love this wipe dispenser - I have one upstairs and one downstairs, and have gifted a couple as well (I've used since my son was born.. Almost 2yrs). Super easy to load, very easy to dispense wipes one-handed (simple push down lid to pop it open), and the white with tiny pop of color goes with any decor. I get my huggy wipes in bulk through amazon mom (20% off) and you can fit about 1/3 of one bag of wipes in here at a time (pretty substantial amount). It looks big but its footprint is the same size as other dispensable wipe containers, so it should fit any of your caddies or changing tables just fine. Highly recommend!",5
3082,"The first time it was a struggle to out this on but after that I got the hang of it. This sleeve helps you hold the bottle easier, and once our granddaughter is able to hold it I think this will help her grip it better too. I like how it protects the metal bottle broom denting if it falls on the floor.",5
3083,"The bag is okay.  Everything fits and it is not embarrassing to carry like other diaper bags.  Other people have fancier bags and I'm sure they work too, but this one was more reasonable.  I would still prefer to carry a tactical backpack.",4
3084,"I tried out many reuseable snack bags and these were my favorite mini version. I use them for my son's snacks during the day - mostly for dry snacks. I either wash them with a bottle brush or put them through the laundry. They've held up well. The only thing I wouldn't use them for again is dried seaweed. The little dried seaweed pieces jammed up the zippers.",5
3085,"I love these bags. I have tried 3-4 different brands and love these the best. The zipper keeps food safe and avoids spills, but is easy to open and access the food. Other brands use velco tops which can be tough to open and crumbs spill out. These are easy to wash out. We use at least 2 a day for lunches and I always keep 2 with snacks in my bag. It's been great to cut down on using plastic snack bags!",5
3086,"We bought these because our baby had to use an oxygen cannula from birth and later even had to use an NG tube. We needed to keep his little fingers from inadvertently pulling either or both of these off. These mittens worked perfectly when we first bought them in January when the weather was still quite cool here in northern California. But as the weather warmed, these proved too be just too thick and caused our baby to get too hot. I wish they were of a lighter and more breathable fabric.Pros:Cute animal designVelcro makes it easy to put on and take off, but not easy for baby to remove on his ownWashes and tumble dries wellSoft fabric (not itchy and does not scratch baby)Big enough for growing hands, but not too big to use on a smaller infant.Cons:Fabric too thick for warm weatherReversible flip design causes even more thickness and is really pointlessNot breathable... my baby's hands got really sweaty and stinky!Expensive!",4
3087,"They are nice but very small and would still slide off my newborn. I wouldn't purchase again because I think they are very overpriced.",4
3088,"These are the only mitts that would stay on my son's hands......expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  I always add them to my baby shower gifts and the moms are always thanking me later on!",5
3089,"I wanted to love these. I wanted my baby to love these. They are lovely to look at, they feel lovely (I love the material they're made of, they feel like extra soft rubber), I love that they're natural.But my son hated them. More than any other pacifier and he really wasn't too picky about pacifiers. They have a tiny little nipple and I guess he just didn't like that. He would suck on them occasionally because he was a pretty easy going baby when it came to pacifiers but once he hit two months old he stopped willingly taking them. He just loved his soothie pacifiers.He currently loves to play with them as a toy. He'll hold them and gnaw on the sides or even the back looped part! He still doesn't like sucking on the nipple part though! haha",1
3090,"These are on our top-ten list for &#34;baby-must-haves&#34;. Absolutely love every aspect of them, the guilt free components (environmentally/baby safe), the easy to clean factor, and now that baby is older - the fact that this can be a strap on (with paci clip) paci and teether in one! So convenient and quality.",5
3091,"I purchased these blankets for my grandson.  The designs on them are cute -- perfect for a little boy!  They are also soft and comfortable, not at all scratchy.  I am very pleased with these blankets!",5
3092,"most disposable breast pads I find make my nipples very itchy. these feel really soft on my flesh and don't stick to my nipples or leave lint.",5
3093,"My little one was unsure how this worked but now she calls it her grown up girl cup! We love it!",5
3094,"Bought this to help my son transition to a regular cup, great little design.Pros: - Detachable lid; - Handles; - 360 degree drinking spoutCons: - Will spill some (to be expected) even after the kid is done drinking (always bring the lid if it's going in a bag!); - Once they 'get' the mechanism, the like to hold it 'open' and watch their drink come spilling out; - Not intuitive to put back together after you clean it.We accidentally threw away the instructions after we put it together the first time, so remember the order of things was trial and error. The plastic seal in the cap has the Avent logo on it, which needs to be readable when looking down at it before you fit the final 'lip stopper' into the top. If the logo is upside-down, you won't get a seal and the drinks will just pour out. The quantity this holds isn't much, but I honestly haven't looked into if this can be used on other Avent cups with more capacity.",4
3095,"I use these to keep my son's stroller straps from rubbing his neck. They are soft and fit everything from his stroller to his toddler swing set. I use these frequently and love them. So cute!",5
3096,"I like the splash guard for my son. I just wish my son would use it. Either way this toilet seat does the job.",4
3097,"Our 14-month old loves it. She's been using it for a couple of month.  We just ordered a third one for every bathroom.",5
3098,"We followed some of the reviews and are super happy witht he purchase. It fits on our modern new Duravit toilet perfectly. Love the handles so that she doesn't touch the toilet and the rim fro her bum is smooth unlike a travel potty we tried. No we just need to get her to poop on it!!! She likes to sit on it and asks to sit on sometimes but jsut doesn't do her business....any tips? :) We do recommend this one. Will be great for boys to b/c the spray gaurd is high enough/big enough.",5
3099,"Someone gave these to us as a gift and at first I had no idea what we would use them for. Now, we use them almost daily. When our daughter was young, we'd use them to hold the clean nipples when we were going out (until we were ready to pop them on the bottle). Then we started using them to take snacks with us on the go (still do this) and also to just serve my daughter snacks in a container. We've also found other creative uses for them (we've packed meds in them when traveling so we didn't have to take a bunch of bottles, tupperware for leftovers, condiment holders for packed lunches, etc).Once you get the hang of the threaded tops, they won't bother you. My daughter can even use them now (20 months).",4
3100,"I bought this mirror because I didn't want to get a mirror that would distort my baby's face, it does the job and she loves it!",5
3101,"For as inexpensive as these are I didn't expect a well made product but they are nice. I've been using them as bum wipes and the wash up great with our diapers.",5
3102,"be careful to let hang dry and keep away from velcro. stitching can be prone to get snagged but they hold up well otherwise.",4
3103,"These work just fine - I love using cloth wipes since my son has an incredibly sensitive bum. I like the flannel/fabric part of these but the reason for 3 stars is that for many of my wipes the edging has partially unraveled, which is annoying.",3
3104,"Very thin and  flimsy and like paper even when wet. I do not recommend for the baby.",1
3105,"I have been happy with using this to prevent diaper rash but I wouldn't recommend using it to treat diaper rash.",4
3106,"It is on the smaller side, but I am ok with that.  It is a cute print, and allows my child to bang away on our oak table without causing damage.  As of currently, my child is 8 months old, and if he picks it up to chew on it, it's not the end of the world for us.  He leaves it alone during mealtime, and we always put a little water underneath to keep it from sliding around.  I also do not leave it on my table overnight or all day so I can't say how the wood and stain on my table handles it.  We just put it on during table time.",5
3107,"This is a great little placemat for home or on the go. It doesn't slide all over the table when my daughter is eating. I haven't had any issues with the ink coming off like I read on other reviews, so I would suspect they were faulty placemats and would ask for a new one. The only reason for 4 stars is it's a little smaller than expected. It's a good size if you want to roll it up and put in a diaper bag, so that's a plus for it being small. Quality is very good. I would purchase again.",4
3108,"This is not a diaper cover! not waterproof! This is a swim diaper. no insert needed. Works Great! one issue, I wish they made this with good leg gussets. Other than that... great job again bummis! your products are AMAZING!",4
3109,"I have purchased it for our new car to protect the seats from our 3 year old inventor. The mat is already not looking great, threads coming out and the shape is somewhat altered. I have purchased the seatsaver of this company and that works well.",3
3110,"I loved these kick mats when I got them. Loved the fact they had the lower strap to secure the bottom of the mat, loved the rubbery material for wet or muddy shoes. I have had them for a while now and I hate them with a passion. The rubbery material slowly disintegrated every time my kids put their feet on them and the back floor of my car ended up covered in a fine black rubber dust constantly. Never mind when one of them is actually in a mood and kicks the seat causing chunks to fall off. The rubber surface looked like a good idea, but not so much.",1
3111,"this doesn't fit in my car (volvo) and I had to rig it with tape to kind of work.  Should have just returned it but I opened it to install it.",2
3112,"We use this with a booster seat (we never bought a highchair) and it works great!  Easy to clean - wet or dry food comes off very easily and it covers our entire chair so no food falls on it.",5
3113,"i wasn't sure if i would like this or not but we have &#34;bigger&#34; kitchen chairs and my daughter does all of her art projects there.  this has literally saved my chair!! it actually holds on to the fabric really well and doesn't slide too much (sometimes she messes it up climbing into the chair though).  it's very easy to clean paint and play-doh off of and we like the neutral color, i would recommend it!",5
3114,"My son (10 months old) seems to genuinely enjoy this chair.  I think he likes being able to dangle his feet.  It connected easily to our dining room table and now he can happily make a mess while eating dinner with us.  The chair is padded nicely at every angle so he looks comfortable.  He's definitely less fussy in this chair than he was in his Prince Lionheart chair that we used before; he just outgrew that.  People have told me how much they love this chair and how great it was for restaurants.  We haven't tried that yet, but I have no doubt that it'll work well.",5
3115,"We've had this chair for 4 months and love it.  Looks great, our 8mo old likes it, and it is sturdy and easy to hook onto our kitchen table. Also easy to take the cloth part off for washing.  Have not used it for travel at all, but it is easy to fold up and pretty lightweight.",5
3116,"Great for the house, picnic tables, travel, restaurants, friends housesLove this product",5
3117,"Not only is this a safe space saver if you hate bulky high chairs like I do, it's a wonderful way to include baby in mealtimes with the family.",5
3118,"Bought this for my 1 yo granddaughter and it's an awesome product.  No more worrying about those dirty high chairs.  This fits perfectly on a table and we can sit our munchkin next to any of us.  It collapses and easy to store, also it comes with a pouch.  We love this product and we don't have to worry about its cleanliness.  By the way do restaurants ever clean high chairs?  Just food for thought.",5
3119,"These swaddles are amazing and great for those of us too tired to properly swaddle with just a blanket... They help my son sleep like, well, a baby. Thank you!",5
3120,"These are so cute and helped calm the little guy when we was still eensy weensy.",5
3121,"I love the SwaddleMe products. These were great to use before my little one started rolling over - I used them daily so I would suggest the two pack so there's always a clean one at the ready.  They wash up well (make sure to secure the velcro first!), are soft to the touch and keep babies safely swaddled without the worry of becoming loose in the middle of the night.  Now that our baby is able to roll over I am using the SwaddleMe zip up blankets. Can't say enough about these products.",5
3122,"We did some research and decided swaddling with wraps was more efficient than with blankets. Keeping baby snug and comfortable is good for the baby and the parents. Being adjustable will give them additional time use....baby isn't here yet, but we are looking forward to using these soon.",5
3123,"Look good and feel very soft but I have a feeling that my little boy is going to outgrow these very quickly.Still a great product.",5
3124,"I love these. They are made of cotton so they are breathable. The velcro is very strong. They wash very well too, do not loose its' form.",5
3125,"My son is a mover! He loves his hands and at 11 weeks he was already rolling over and playing with his feet. I decided to try these because of the price and they are thinner than the halo brand. He still sometimes gets an arm out, which never happened in the bigger/thicker halo swaddlers, but the halos are too much fabric for the heat of the summer and they cost twice as much. I just ordered size large because he still needs a swaddle going on 4 months.",4
3126,"...to wiggle his way out of this one.  The design allows my little guy to get his hands out under the flaps every time, which totally defeats the purpose of this product and creates a dangerous/uncomfortable bunching of fabric up around his shoulders/chin/mouth..  I love that the fabric is soft, strong, and yet light (not too hot), and the velcroe also seems sturdy but not overly strong.  However, the flaps are poorly designed.  I have a size small and my baby is about 10 lbs.",3
3127,"I bought these thinking they were such a great idea. I had never heard of the woombie though so these were the first zip up swaddler I bought. I noticed my son could get his hands out of the top though and he seemed to wiggle around in them a lot and was always trying to stretch his legs out but his feet were at the bottom in it. Then I saw the woombie here on amazon and even though it cost more I decided to try it instead and I am soo happy I did! The woombie is more snug and he can't get his hands out of the top. They are also longer so he has room to wiggle his feet. The woombie is soo much better, I wish I never wasted my money on these! These would work well for you if you have a short chubby baby though, or if you want your baby to be able to suck on his fingers.",2
3128,"My baby was 6 lbs and 19 inches when we first tried to use these. Wasted effort. They were too loose on her and she could move about as freely as she wanted, including getting her hands up through the neck hole to hit herself in the face (the reason we were swaddling). We thought maybe she was just too little and that the lower end of 5 lbs on the packaging was a bit of a stretch. Well we tried again when she was 7.5 lbs and 22 inches with the same result. At that point we switched over to the swaddlemes with velcro which worked better. The new velcro plus zipper-bottom pouches they have just released would be what I purchased next time as it seems like it would solve all the things I disliked about earlier products.",2
3129,"My newborn got out of these within 5 seconds of putting it on. Their hands can get out of the neck hole really easily. This is a waste of money, go ahead and spend it on the woombie.",2
3130,"The patterns are super cute, but this definitely couldn't fit a 4 year old like the description says. In fact, this was pretty snug on my daughter who is in the 20th percentile in both height and weight at 6 months old, so I find it very hard to believe that this could fit a 4 year old comfortably.",3
3131,"Absolutely perfect for helping baby prop his bottle by himself. He was able to grip this better than around the whole heavy bottle. It fit our angled bottles because this isn't a ridgid plastic (even though it is supposed to be for straight bottles), it fit our needs.",5
3132,"I  use Medela bottles the 5 oz size. It does not fit as pictured.  I have to slide the ball into the middle of the bottle.  My little one does not like to use it like this.  She does like to play with it just likes ball.  She can hold it and move it around.  So I got a toy instead.",3
3133,"This is really nice to have for your diaper bag. It doesnt take up much room and if you like you can clip it to the outside of the bag! Nice to have these little baggies for those stinky diapers, and other people appreciate it too!",5
3134,"Works as a bag dispenser, but I was never completely happy with this product. The green clip is essentially non functioning, impossible to move. The refilling door continually opens causing you to loose the entire roll of bags, so the product must me kept inside my diaper bag. Annoying since it is a bulky with the big plastic clip.  The bags are only slighter larger then our doggie bags. I do not recommend this product.  There are better quality and much cuiter doggie bag dispensers to server this purpose.",1
3135,"I have one for me and one for my husband and a must have!  The bags help hide the smell and it's convenient to use.  A must have!",5
3136,"The price for this product is comparable to a large discount store, but I live in a rural area so the closest big retailer is 20 miles away.  Online ordering with reliable delivery is a huge convenience for me.  This is a handy product to keep in your car for trash disposal.",5
3137,"Little too big to carry in a diaperbag and the trash bag is wasteful in that the size is too big thus you get less number of bags per roll. I prefer the munchkin brand over this one.",3
3138,"A bit bulky for transportation. The clasp constantly opens with even the slightest touch. Can't keep it in anything or it will open with pressure. It opens even when I try to pull a bag out normally.",3
3139,"I am happy with these bags and the despenser. It is really handy to carry with you and takes up little space in the diaper bag.",5
3140,"these are great in the diaper bag and my mother uses them (she watches darling two days a week) they are perfect in the dispenser.  Anything to make life easier.",5
3141,"Love this litle mobile...It is convertible and plays great music. It also has several awesome features and our baby loves it!",5
3142,"Needed a second charger, and this fits the bill.  We keep one downstairs and one upstairs.  The monitor doesn't hold a charge for more than 4-5 hours (or maybe I'm just looking at it too often!) so a second charger is needed at the end of naptime.",5
3143,"As I am preparing to go back to work I realized that with my long 12  hour shifts my husband is going to be hauling our diaper bag around a lot. He isn&#8217;t too thrilled with that idea. I came across this at a garage sale for a few bucks and fell in love! I figured that I could use this in place of my diaper bag most of the time and carry my cute purse again (it feels good to have something that doesn&#8217;t scream &#8220;mom&#8221;). Anyway, this is perfect. Especially since I&#8217;ve recently just started carrying an extra diaper, wipes and change of clothes in the car and not hauling a diaper bag around anyway. I just leave this in the car all the time and restock as necessary. That way for quick trips around or to take my older child to sports events I only have to grab the baby, my phone and keys and I&#8217;m out the door. I breastfeed, so if you need to carry bottles and formula that&#8217;s another story. My husband just carries that stuff in a small separate bag.Whoever designed this kit obviously has kids and really understands how to make something functional. First off, from the outside it looks stylish. The gray color with baby blue accents is cute. I actually almost didn&#8217;t look at it because it looked like a CD case from the outside. The changing pad is a great size and easy to clean. It&#8217;s very helpful that it zips off! The pockets are great for a couple diapers and small package of wipes. I buy wipes in the travel size section of the grocery store for it. That&#8217;s all I put in it. I keep one extra outfit in each of our trunks and don&#8217;t usually need diaper cream, so the pockets are just right. If you want to carry a bunch of stuff, consider using a diaper bag. I&#8217;m a minimalist and try to carry the bare necessities.",5
3144,"Had it for a few months now, no problems with it staying put on smooth, clean tile.  Easy to toss toys in, netting allows toys to dry thoroughly to prevent mildew.",5
3145,"This would not suction to my wall. My tile is slightly the textured but not much. Not sure what to do with it now.",1
3146,"I guess I should have done better research but this is too small for many of my babies bath toys.  the opening is quite narrow.  Am sending back and getting a different one.",3
3147,"I've tried EVERYTHING to get this piece of junk to stick to the bathroom tile with no luck!  The Boon Frog Bath Toy Scoop is way better and worth the extra money as it actually sticks to the tile.",1
3148,"This has been great for the tub.  Sometimes it doesn't stick as well, but I think it is my fault.  Easy to use and scoop up toys.",4
3149,"This is exactly what you think it will be. I did have the suction cup fall once (even though it was applied to a clean dry surface) but I just put it back and it's stayed so far.",3
3150,"elves it's purpose. My only complaint is that the suction cup doesn't work at all. Minus a star for that. Otherwise, no complaints.",4
3151,"Good durable bag and dries quickly, but it kept falling off the wall, no matter what I tried to do to get the sunction to work properly.",3
3152,"SO I really love that it works well with scooping up the toys from the bath tub, and I really love that it's made of netting so that the toys can dry. But...it doesn't stick to the wall of the shower very well! If it stuck to the wall, it would be a five star rating! But no matter how hard I try, that thing falls down. I am able to use the ledge of the scooper to hang it on the shower curtain though, which is alright too :)",4
3153,"When hanging it the first time (according to directions), it slipped. Twice. One more time and it's going back.The hook part on the hanger that's supposed to catch on the scoop could be deeper. It's only like a 1/2&#34;, not even, so the scoop slips off easily.",3
3154,"Our kids bathroom is also the guest bathroom. I don't want toys just laying all over the tub, so I purchased this little organizer to keep the bathroom looking neat and clean. It has a suction cup and I have smooth tiles, so it holds on really well. There was a few times where it would become loose, but it would stick back on. I like how you can remove the scoop bag and collect all the toys and then place it right back on the base. It's a good size and it fits a good amount of toys.",4
3155,"Awesome for the bath",5
3156,"The plastic piece attached to the suction cup broke -- we have never removed it from the shower wall, so it's not like it was from a ton of use.  Total junk!  It's too bad, because it's a really cool product.",1
3157,"My daughter's bath toys were getting out of control.  We didn't have enough storage space, and I had previously bought one of those cheap net bags that hang with suction cups.  The spaces between the netting were too big, and toys would get tangled in it, and it was too flimsy, making it difficult to put toys away in it or get them out.  This scoop is nice because the top is molded open, so we can just toss toys in one handed like a basketball hoop, or take it off the wall and scoop them up  from the water using the handle, too.  The suction cup is really sturdy, I've had it for a couple months now and it hasn't budged from the shower tile where I initially hung it up.  I imagine reviewers who have had problems with the suction cup don't have perfectly smooth tiles, they must have a little texture to them or something.",5
3158,"Nice idea however we have a non rectangular bath and hence the scoop is too wide to fit due to the curvature of the bath. Nice idea just didn't work for us.",2
3159,"I was using a folded towel to kneel down on while bathing my son...but wanted something I didn't have to throw in the wash after every use, so I purchased the BRICA bath kneeler. I'm pleased with my purchase as it serves its purpose and provides a soft surface for me to kneel on during bathtime. When we are done, I simply wipe it down and hang it on my towel rack.",5
3160,"Perfect size and made out of durable nonslip materials - not cheap like the other knee protectors.  I love Brica!",5
3161,"I honestly do not know how parents have survived this long without the kneeler. I use it everytime I wash my 10 month old. Went to someone's house who didnt have this and actually missed this item....buy for every baby shower I attend. Yes, it's a little luxory but worth every penny.",5
3162,"It's smaller than I expected, but it is enough. Really helps my knees. I use it every day. Once I won't needed it for my son's bath I plan on using while gardening.",5
3163,"It is so big my baby is lost in it....It is an adult sized towel to wrap around my neck....I would not recommend it....",1
3164,"I wish I had this towel with my first baby! A must have for all parents. This will be my new go-to baby present for all of my friends!",5
3165,"We love this mat. It is very cushy and covers enough ground to bathe both of my twins at the same time. I read some reviews about the suctions cups not sticking- I usually wait until the tub starts filling to put the mat down, then stick the outside cups down. They don't always all stay stuck, but enough of them stick to that it doesn't float. Then once the boys at in the tub it never comes up. We hang it by the suction cups on the side of the shower to dry after every bath (and that is where we store it) and we haven't had any issues with mold or smell. I'd definitely buy it again.We have not tried this in a shower- just for the baths.",5
3166,"Bought this for ease of use in my second vehicle. Works great and has a easy uninstall clip incase u have to remove it.",5
3167,"Love how light this car seat is. It is also comfortable and secure for my son. I would purchase again.",5
3168,"We got this seat to be an auxiliary seat and for use with airline travel.  We didn't want to spend a lot.  When this seat arrived, I was amazed and impressed with the quality.  Our other convertible seats are Britax Boulevards, and since the price on those is so much more expensive, I expected that this seat might be visible cheap or flimsy.  I was surprised to find that it was not.What this seat certainly lacks compared to more expensive seats is ease of installation.  The LATCH clips work adequately but are old school metal clips--no fancy red buttons or easy to use latching mechanisms.  When installing through LATCH, this seat doesn't tighten separately on each side, rather, it has one strap that tightens the seat in.  That works fine and adjusts easily enough.  It installs very similarly to our Graco Nautilus, for anyone familiar with that seat.This seat was also great for use on an airplane because the base is narrow.  You can easily carry it down the aisle of an airplane, and it fits well within a plane seat.I feel secure with my toddler using this seat.  I still prefer the Britax for our everyday use, but if that isn't an option in someone's budget, I find that this seat is of worthwhile quality and is well worth the price tag.",5
3169,"Got this cheapie for my moms car in the event that she may need it.  Lightweight and doesn't take up much space.",3
3170,"The baby gear industry, like the wedding industry, is definitley over-hyped. You can buy a car seat for $200+ with all sorts of crazy features that promises to save your child from the end of the world, or this one, for much less, that still provides 2x the Federal Safety Standard. Installation is quick and easy forward or rear facing, and the seat is well designed with storage for the LATCH clip (when not in use) and the instruction booklet (key if you're taking this seat traveling and need to figure out how to hook it up with a seatbelt). Haven't noticed any complaining from my 20 month old about 'comfort', although he does take the headrest off (it has a very plastic-y feel and sticks to him when he gets the nap sweats). Super easy to clean, the cover is machine washable and the straps wipe off quickly. We haven't used the cupholder yet but I'm sure it'll come in handy when the boy is older and a little more coordinated.",5
3171,"My daughter didn't like, the bottom is a little hard for long trips.  There's also a strap that's suppose to keep the seat belt in place but just gets in the way.  I guess you get what you paid for.",2
3172,"We bought this quickly as a secondary seat, so for the price I wasn't expecting it to be much. It was easy enough to assemble but it doesn't feel very durable or seem like it's going to be very comfortable to sit in. Next time I'd spend more money for a better quality seat.",2
3173,"MY SON LOVES HIS CHAIR AND WORKS PERFECTLY FINE FOR MY TODDLER AND THE OTHER CHAIR WE HAVE FOR MMY BABY, NICE COLOR AND DESIGN AND IT IS VERY SIMPLE TO ASSEMBLE",5
3174,"Love! Love! Love! This pack-n-play.  The colors work great for a boy or girl.  The changing station is really the priceless piece.  We cover the changing portion with a swaddling blanket to keep it clean.  A few reasons I liked this pack-n-play over others:1) The changing station isn't super slanted making the baby roll to one side2) The simplicity of the overall product3) Includes a travel bag4) easily sets up and breaks downI would definitely recommend this product to anyone.",5
3175,"I was so excited about this gate, but when it arrived, it was too large for my standard 36&#34; door.  I looked online and realized that there were no dimensions listed for the product.  (Interestingly there is a similar gate available on here which does list dimensions, and I can see that since it's called &#34;wide&#34; that maybe that would imply that it's for exclusively wide doors, not normal AND wide doors!)  So, fyi - this is for doors &#62;38&#34;.",2
3176,"Mixed feelings on this gate... It does it's job, and our son doesn't feel like he is trapped behind jail bars.  Holds up on the wall great and very sturdy fabric.  But this gate is simply way too tall.  I don't understand why.  My wife is 5'4&#34; and can barely make it over without knocking her knees on the bar.  I'm 5'10&#34; and it's a bit tough for me too.  When my parents come over, I have to take it down because they can't get over it.Please re-design this product to be 3-5 inches shorter.",3
3177,"Nice sling, well made with very pretty fabric BUT IT DOESN'T FIT! I measured myself with a tape measure and according to the official Hotslings size chart I measure a 24&#34; from shoulder to hip which is 2&#34; below the maximum size for their regular size sling.when it arrived it barely fit over my frame at all- let alone with the baby in it! I had it adjusted so the buckle's cinches were all the way out and it was as big as it would go. It was way too small. So irritating!",2
3178,"I bought this a few months ago for my 2nd child.  I have 4 other strollers in my garage that never get used now.  This is by far the best!  My sister-in-law recommended it to me.  The extra large shade is great here in FL to keep the sun off my LO.  The best thing about it is the way it rides.  You can easily push it with one hand and navigate it with ease.  It's very smooth. This is great when trying to hold a door open for yourself and attempting to push a stroller through at the same time.  It is also great when I need to push the baby while holding my 5 year old's hand at the same time.  It folds and unfolds easier than any other stroller I have ever owned.  It also works for a baby OR a larger child. Although I use it mostly for my 8m old baby....my 5 year old fits in it comfortably for the occasional times she is too tired to walk and I need to use the carrier for the baby and let her ride in the stroller (such as at Disney).  This product is worth every penny!",5
3179,"I love this stroller.  I have a bumbleride indie that I use for jogging and any rough terrain. The bumbleride takes up almost my full trunk in my equinox and is a complete pain to fold and unfold.  This stroller is amazing!  The shade is awesome, you can pretty much choose how much of your child you want to shade with three choices.  It is not lying when it says one hand fold.  I can do it with my daughter on my hip and throw it in the truck.  It folds completely flat and leaves so much room for groceries and such.  It has a basket underneath with is decent size then a handy net pocket on the full back of the stroller.  Very useful! The wheels feel almost like a foam though which creates a smooth ride but I can see how they would wear quickly.  This stroller is worth every penny and then some. The only complaint I have is I wish the handle was adjustable.  I would like for it to be a little lower. Great 'umbrella stroller', I would buy again and would recommend to a friend! My daughter is 18 months old and has tons of room to grow into this stroller!",5
3180,"We have been through many strollers and so far this is my favorite.  I love the ease of opening and closing this stroller and it's pretty lightweight.  I love that the wheels are not touching the seat while folded like a previous stroller did which resulted in the whole canopy getting filthy.  This canopy is working wonderful here in Arizona with the constant heat and sunshine, it easily covers my son providing protection.  The restraint is easy to clip and un-clip and appears comfortable.  Having had three previous strollers, this handles the best by far.  It's just so easy to steer and it never gets hung up on itself like other strollers did.  The width is good so I can still take it shopping as well as outside.  I would recommend it without reservations, I am actually bummed I hadn't purchased it with my first child.  Great purchase!",5
3181,"This stroller is amazing! you drive with one hand and the wheels are great that can go over grass and rocks... Basket is a little small, but we make work! very happy with it the GT is worth the extra money, the wheels are better and the hand break is key!",5
3182,"We waited a long time to finally purchase a stroller to replace the clunky 2008 hand-me-down phil & teds stroller. This baby jogger city mini is a breeze to push with one hand. I LOVE this stroller! I even have a series of pictures of me and my kid and all the places we go with it. I feel like I have a level of freedom that I didn't have before. I am SO happy!",5
3183,"I love this stroller. It is my favourite stroller and we've been through a few. I prefer it to the Bugaboo bee (now sold), the Britax B-ready (can be single but currently used as a tandem) and the Baby Jogger City Select (also can be used a single but currently used as a tandem) and our umbrella stroller. This stroller has a great ride, pushes like a dream, the adjustable handlebar is fantastic and the seat is a great size for a tall but slim nearly 2 year old. It is definitely worth getting the gt over the basic mini for the sake of the adjustable height handle bar alone. The more rugged tires are fantastic for use in the park or over rougher terrain but this stroller is not too large to use indoors.",5
3184,"Really can't say enough good about this stroller.  It is super smooth, folds easily, has &#34;real&#34; wheels not hard molded plastic, has the adjustable handlebar and the sun shade/awning provides great shade while walking.  The seat back reclines practically flat and there is mesh at the head when reclined so no fear of pacifiers or toys falling out the top.Our only issue is that it does not come with a parent tray for keys, drink, etc nor does it come with a child tray for their sippy cup or snacks.  They are sold separately.",5
3185,"We bought this as a secondary stroller because our primary stroller (Quinny Buzz) is a full sized stroller and it is too much hassle to travel on the plane with. This stroller is great because of the large (really large) canopy so it is really useful on sunny days in spring and summer. The rubber tires make it sooooo easy to push and I can easily push with just one hand. The basket is not as small as I thought it would be - I can easily put a gallon of milk, a tub of yogurt, a melon, some vege, some fruits (you get the idea) when I go to the store. One thing that I don't love is how LO seems to slide in the seat, no matter how tight I buckle him up. But he hasn't complained so maybe it isn't uncomfortable for him. Oh, and forget about the velcro at the back where its supposed to stick to the seat to make things neater - they stopped sticking together after about a week (but don't bother us).",4
3186,"We are well pleased with this stroller, and I would recommend it to others.  The only real problem with this stroller is the lack of cargo space and the difficulty with which the cargo space is accessed.  To accommodate for the lack of access to cargo space, I use stroller hooks to affix my diaper bag to the stroller frame, and I use a mommy hook on the handle to attach any odds and ends.I have not purchased a bar or any trays to go in front of kids, and I'm happy about that.  I think they'd just be in the way, really, and they're not necessary.  I also didn't  purchase the baby seat adapter, but rather, started laying my infant in this stroller for use when he was about 3 months old.  I would have done so earlier if I needed to, but it was winter and I wasn't really using a double stroller while the baby was that little.  I'm glad I saved the expense on those accessories.The stroller does need a parent console.  The best option I've found for that is the bob duallie console.  It's not a perfect fit, but it's adequate and functional.  I also bought the baby jogger stroller bag for use with airline travel and was much more impressed with the travel bag than I had expected to be.The stroller handles well.  It turns on a dime, and there is no problem getting through doors at commercial establishments.  I tried it in my house, and it goes through most interior doorframes as well.  It's good for use at the mall, the park, or bumpy city sidewalks.  It is not, however, a jogging stroller, but it handles multiple types of terrain very well.  It's got lots of space for our toddler, and the separate recline for the baby is great.  The shades are large and I didn't realize before this stroller how nice it is to have such large sunshades.  It's also great that they operate separately. The stroller folds easily, and folds small.  It takes up drastically less trunk space than my single babytrend jogger.  It's also easier to fold and easier to load in and out of my Ford Fusion trunk than the single stroller.  On a recent trip we fit this stroller and two large pieces of luggage along with some smaller items in the trunk of our Ford Fusion.The only complaint is the cargo space.  It seems to me that the design could be modified with only slight adjustments to allow meaningful access to the cargo space.  As it is, the cargo area will hold quite a bit, but nothing that is large.  So, you can put lots of small items in--jackets, lunch bags, half filled duffel bags, but you cannot fit in a full diaper bag or anything of the sort.We got a good deal on this stroller, and I would buy it again and recommend it to others.",4
3187,"I call it &#34;vanilla boob.&#34;  It's a light, refreshing scent and good for the days that you don't feel quite clean enough for baby (like after going for a walk, etc).",5
3188,"Now that we have a two month old these work well at night but at first they were too big so we had several messes.  As long as you don't have a small baby I would recommend them.",4
3189,"They look great, a little tricky to apply to the wall, but some of them sort of peel off on thier own after a few days.  I love them but they are tricky to apply perfectly. If you are good with crafts/precision and are patient then it shouldn't be a problem. I do recommend them. We ahve them all, the birds, the owl and tree and the savanna",3
3190,"These bibs are great for our 8 month old who is now eating purees, it gets messy! They clean up easily too.",5
3191,"I send these in my toddler's lunch and they are perfect for little hands to grip and self feed.  I had other more expensive versions that did not always make the return trip home so now if these do not come home I am ok with buying more.",4
3192,"This warmer is very handy to have in the car. We use it when travelling or when we are just out shopping for a few hours. The temperature is perfect every time. And the baby agrees. lol",5
3193,"This sound machine has lovely white noise that my baby needs to sleep, and beautiful turning light pictures projected on the ceiling. So after 2 months when the motor burned out and stopped moving the projection, we immediately purchased another one (the first was a gift off amazon, the second was from babies r us). And then, within 2 weeks, the SAME THING HAPPENED. We only even ran the projections at night. After reading up about these machines, this seems to be a common problem. Very disappointed",2
3194,"this is a great buy. i can't believe how affordable it is. i would have paid much more for it. we use this as white noise for our son. the volume can get very high which is nice. it also plays lullabys and mozart and other sounds. we haven't used the projector yet but it works and looks really good. the night light is nice as well. its easy to use and is also small and compact. get it!",5
3195,"I've had this for 2 years almost and am very pleased! We only use the white noise option and keep it on continuously. For the last 6-8 months we've been using the projector. Everything still works well, no problems. I do think it would be nice if they sold more cartridges with difference scenes.",5
3196,"I bought this when I decided to move my 3 months old boy to his room. He loves it and falls asleep within minutes.It helps him to relax at night! I love the fact its pretty easy to use, comes with 3 pictures, you can choose songs or sounds and it has a timer so you don't have to worry about getting up in the middle of the night to turn it off.Best purchase ever!",5
3197,"I originally bought this, to block the kitchen area off when my granddaughter was visiting.  Turns out, my stove doesn't get hot on the outside, so I've never even used it!  It seemed well constructed though and easy to use.  For anyone needing to block off an entrance, I would recommend it.",4
3198,"My husband purchased two of these at a cheap price (looks like the price dropped more now though). So I can't be surprised about the quality of these gates. If you are looking for something cheap and simple grab one of these. They are easily adjustable and the tension is quite good. However be warned that two problems will arise over time. The first problem is the cheap plastic bar that you pull up and push down to engage the tension. After a while it starts to bow outwards and you will have to keep extending the gate to increase the tension. The second issue arises if you use this gate to keep your mischievous toddler contained or out of a particular area. My kiddo is now 20months and shakes this gate with Godzilla like strength. The little plastic piece at the top of the gate that keeps the two sliding frames aligned often pops apart and the gate appears to be half broken. It doesn't completely break it and it can be popped back together but it is very frustrating and not the safest item to rely on if you are using this gate to keep your kid from some sort of danger. Again for the price... you get what you pay for. I could see this being great for crawlers and small pets.",3
3199,"While our baby is growing we felt it important to have her in our lap while we are eating or working.  This keeps her stable and safe and the best part is she can feel calm while she's being held. Works in chairs and laps.",5
3200,"Our little one loves this bottle. It didn't cause nipple confusion for him and it still works really well! We have no complaints.",5
3201,"I love medela products and thought this would be great for my 12 week old due to that she now is being bottle fed breastmilk.  The nipple is awkward for her to take and when the milk did come out it was way to much for her.  I know this is a new product and there are a few different brands out there.  I will be looking to other brands.",2
3202,"My husband loves this one because it looks cooler than the green organic Ergo that we have been using AND it can forward face.  The zipper part in the bottom looks kind of weird like you are getting a peep show, but of course you are not haha.  The top part that folds down below their chin is a little bit thick and bulky and high.  I can only see the top of my 6.5 month old's face.  He will get taller though.  And if I took that extra bib piece off the top so it is less bulky, the regular piece has a fold and velcro where the bib is attached that becomes exposed and doesn't look very great.  My husband seems to think it is comfortable.  My baby loves to face out so they have fun doing that together.  I mostly got this for him so that he can face the baby out without using a crotch dangler carrierI think my shoulders hurt a lot sooner that with the Ergo.  We were trying to get the new Ergo 360 but they are sold out and back ordered everywhere.  So, I caved and ordered this one instead.  It will do.  I will still probably use the Ergo myself on certain occasions.  Maybe be the time we have a second child we will get the Ergo 360.",3
3203,"I had such high hope for it.  My 1 1/2 year old is painfully teething incisors and molars.  It lasted 30 seconds. I then got the gumdrop pacifier(which I was trying to avoid since she weened off mam pacifiers when she shredded them) that she will at least munch on for a couple minutes.",2
3204,"we were using a Playtex brand teether similar to this but they stopped making them. my son has sensory issues and still chews and bites when he's upset or angry or tired. this fit his mouth great, and since I don't want him using a paci this is a great transition, he can't suck on it, but can fully bite down, sturdy yet chewy material, he cannot bite through, wish I could freeze it though.",4
3205,"My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.",2
3206,"These are really nice diaper changing pads and are easy to wash. I recommend buying 2 sets for a total of six.",5
3207,"I've used this boppy all over the place. It is so hard to get comfortable when you are not home in your chair, but this thing makes it possible. I'm a &#34;My Brest Friend&#34; person at home, but this is the best when out. It's not small by any means, but the strap is great. Also since it folds closed, the top is protected from getting dirty, which is nice for both baby and breast.",5
3208,"This head support is a life saver. I used to look around desperately for emergency parking spots so I can stop and check me 1mo's breathing as her head would always be dangling beside her! My baby girl is 2.5mo now and I haven't worried about her head support ever since I started using this product. It's a must have.",5
3209,"I gave this product 4 stars because the pictures make it look like you are getting two when you are only getting one. I put this in my citi mini and supports my 4 month olds head",4
3210,"If your child has a flat spot on their head, you need this pillow! My husband found this on Amazon and I am THRILLED. Within one week we could see results. We bought both pillows, this one with the extra neck support and the other one without (for when he is laying on the floor.) We use this one in the stroller and carseat.",5
3211,"I bought this head support after buying the Noggin Nest (also from Boppy). I use both in the carseat to help with my little one's flat spot. I noticed that my little one's head would flop forward when she fell asleep on longer car trips. This scared me so I bought this head support. The neck guard is bulky and doesn't look super comfortable, but it keeps her head in place while sleeping, so I am happy and she can sleep without her head wobbling all over the place.",5
3212,"We weren't sure what to expect when we asked for this on our gift registry. After using it over the past five months we con say we absolutely love it. It's soft and holds warm water to keep our baby comfortable. Our infant son loves bath time, I wonder if his opinion would be different had we used a hard plastic tub.Bonus, It fits into all of our sinks and is easily portable when dry. Great for family visits.Taking care of it is a bit more trouble than a plastic tub which can be cleaned and dried with a cloth, but we feel the benefits outweighs the small hassle. At first we tried rinsing and squeezing out the excess water and hanging it to dry, but it would still get stinky. We now put it in the washing machine, then into the dryer on the lowest heat setting. Pretty darn easy.",5
3213,"I hate having to step over the bottom piece of a baby gate when walking though it.  I installed this gate in doorways that we use all the time and I'm very happy with it.  It is strong enough that my son can stand on it and it doesn't bend or sway at all.  It is easy to open and close, and it doesn't seem like the doorway is constricted at all when the gate is open.  This is by far, my favorite baby gate.",5
3214,"Love these cups - and these are the only kind I buy anymore. After going through two kids and countless &#34;no spill&#34; sippy cups that truly weren't no spill.. I tried these and I will say they truly are &#34;no spill&#34;. There are not a bunch of parts which is great for busy parents. It has a silicone spout on the inside that simply pushes onto the underside of the lid and away you go. The inside spout piece is also big enough so it doesn't fall out of the dishwasher &#34;cage&#34; that I have for all the little pieces. The lids easily go on and you will hear a &#34;click&#34; when they are where they are supposed to be so you don't over tighten them or not tighten them enough. My toddler loves these and they have been through the tests - drops/throws/night time/ outdoor play.. and no leaks. nothing. I highly recommend.",5
3215,"we used these with my daughter starting at 10  months and we still use them at 17 months. However, we are switching to a different cup with a softer bit part because these are a little harder to get liquid out of.",4
3216,"I think our 8 month old baby prefers these trainer cups to his bottle but we still use bottles for milk. However we do use these cups for water and he loves using them. He grasps both handles and holds them up to his mouth and doesn't create a mess!",5
3217,"I have had such a struggle finding a good sippy cup for my 9 month old because they always end up leaking after the second or third use. These didn't leak and lock securely so my son can throw them. hahaGreat cups and super easy for the little ones.",5
3218,"My baby just knows how to drink from this bottle. Save me the effort to teach. I even watched the video online about how to teach baby to use straw cup.",5
3219,"My son transitioned easily from bottle to these sippy cups. They are easy to take apart and clean. They snap in place so you know there will be no leaking. Highly recommended!",5
3220,"The traditional 'sippy cup' that you have to lift and tilt up didn't work for my 7-12 month old - she wasn't getting the whole gravity part.  So, I bought a few different straw sippy cups.  This one is the best in my opinion.  Not too many parts and if she hurtles it to the ground you usually only get a tiny bit of spillage, if any.  I actually bought about 4 of these.",5
3221,"I think these are the best bottles out there. They are easy to clean, light weight, durable, and don't leak. I have used them with my LO since he was 4 months old for Breast milk feeding. He has never been fussy, never had nipple confusion, and he can hold the bottle on his own.  At 7 months of age, I have continued to use these bottles and nipples. I like the slower flow nipples since we r still breast feeding. He is eating solids now, this is still enough milk for a feeding. We recently bought a born free sippy cup, to convet our bottles to cups and all parts fit. I do recommend these bottles.",5
3222,"Love our born free bottles. Never use the silicone cover and have dropped them on tile floor with no breaks or even chips. The glass warms quicker than the plastic and I think they clean better as well. We have both glass and plastic and I prefer the glass.",5
3223,"Fun fact, these bottles are completely interchangable with the dr browns wide neck bottles - nipples, screw on cap, and even the parts inside. This really is of no use except I got these for my shower (I registered for acouple different kinds) and since we now only use dr browns and this saved me buying acouple extra bottles!I did try these as their regular system and the venting system totally didn't work for us. Like someone else mentioned the nipple kept depressing almost immediately when our son drank - which doesn't happen at all with the same nipples when using the dr browns system. But every kid is a bit different so what is great for one is terrible for another.",3
3224,"I have been using these bottles for about 10 days and they are great!Easy to clean and the parts that keep it vented are also easy to take apart and keep clean.I highly recommend these bottles.",5
3225,"I was given a Medela shield at the hospital and it really helped my little girl breastfeed. I soon realized having more than one would be handy for different reasons. I was surprised how expensive they were when I went to the store so I also bought this less expensive NUK band shield to try at almost half the price. i would say it is just as good as the Medela if not better. It seems to clean up better and the case is nice for in the diaper bag (before I was using a ziplock bag). Save some money and give it a try!",5
3226,"The diameter is right, but it's way tooooo long! Don't understand why they design like that. You have to have nipples as high as 6 cm to use them. Or did I get it wrong?",2
3227,"My baby struggled with latching so in the hospital we started out on the medela shield which worked great. Then a month in I rwlized I rsakly needed a few more so I always had a clean one on hand but the medelas are spendy. This got good reviews and was cheaper so I tried it. I ended up liking this more than the medela!!! My baby weaned off after two months so I didn't use it that long but it made my life much easier.",5
3228,"I used nipple shields after my twins got thrush to try and get them to nurse again. It worked and they were 4 months old at the time and hadn't nursed for weeks... I lost several nipple shields before buying this case and none since. It also has holes in it to breath- so if you're like me and wash the shields and stick it in the case, then your diaper bag, you don't have to worry about the moisture building up and growing bacteria. Just wish it came in bright colors to be able to find a bit easier!",5
3229,"I bought them about one week ago to replace my other NUK pacifier (they trap water like crazy). I like the one-piece design b/c you won't get any dirt or water or lint or hair trapped. However, I don;t know what type of silicone they use, it stinks! Now they have been sitting on my desk for a couple of days and the smell seems to go away...a little...I like the orthodontic design, but just can't bear that plastic smell.",3
3230,"My baby started teething pretty young and this teether is one that she could hold, even when her hands were small, and get her mouth around. She still likes it (at 8 months old), and I often bring it with us on walks or other outings so that she has something to hold onto and play with.It's easy to clean. It's flexible--not a hard plastic. My flower is more red than the color shown in this picture.",5
3231,"The pink and purple bottles are made in China while the standard color bottles are still made in the US. Why make them differently??",3
3232,"These are great bottles, our child has no problem while drinking with them since the air flows so well back into the bottle with the venting system. The only downside to these is that they are harder to clean. You get used to it pretty quickly though. We also use Avent widemouth bottles when we need something we can quickly clean and dry, but the Avent bottles venting system only works about half the time.If your child is having problems with bubbles or gas, I'd definitely try these out!",5
3233,"I love this thing! I was using the gliding ottoman from an old rocking/glider chair to sit on while bathing my son and our vanity and toilet tank were littered with baby shampoo, soap, bubbles, tooth paste... This holds everything in one place out of the way.  It folds, unfolds, and stores away very easily and quickly. I can't believe I went 10 months without it!!",5
3234,"This seat is great for giving our daughter a bath.  The pockets are a bit small to hold most shampoo's and bubble bath, but this is so much more comfortable than kneeling next to the tub that I can overlook that.  Plus it holds a lot more weight than advertised.  Holds my 260lb frame and it still feels sturdy.  I like that it folds up as well and fits under the sink.  Wish we had bought this sooner though.",5
3235,"I am really in love with this product. It is an excellent product beginning with the fabrics and colors and ending, obviously, with the price. It have a great quality. I hand wash them and the colors stay vivid and the fabric didn't fall apart. I really recommend this brand and also the seller! They are great!!!!",5
3236,"Bottom line: These are okay for the price, but I wouldn't buy them again, and I wouldn't give them as a gift. For an inexpensive muslin blanket I would choose Laura Ashley over these.I can't compare this to the super expensive A&A; because I haven't been able to justify spending almost $15 a blanket yet. However, I can compare these to Laura Ashley muslin blankets which are comparable in price to these. The big difference is that the Laura Ashley blankets are smaller. (They are still large enough to wrap my 13 pound 2 month old in, but I'm sure they are going to be too small by the time she is a few months older). That being said, I prefer Laura Ashley to Hudson Baby because they are much softer. I can see how other reviewers say Hudson blankets are scratchy. They definitely are right out of the box, but after a few washes they soften up. Still not as soft as Laura Ashley, though, and I'm sure not as soft as A&A.; I will say that the baby doesn't seem to notice a difference between Laura Ashley and Hudson blankets.",3
3237,"I really like these blankets. Although I didn't quite use these for swaddling our baby (our's is a very wiggly one and has never met a swaddle he can't beat to free his arms), it is very soft on baby's skin and breathable enough to avoid overheating. It has a stretchable quality to it - so it does allow some room for arms/legs movements after swaddling, but that also makes it easy for the little ones to break free from the swaddle.  I generally use it as sheet for my son to sleep on and I swear he sleeps better on them (guess he likes it's soft feel).",4
3238,"I bought these sippy cups thinking that the soft nozzle would be a good transition from a bottle to the normal hard-tipped sippy cups, but I had no idea that these sippy cups would leak. When i say leak, i mean a constant stream of milk runs from the bottom of the lid every time it is tipped. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. These sippy cups are easy for my 12 month old to hold, however because they leak, I no longer use them.",1
3239,"I installed it on 2007 Nissan Maxima and other than having to use the pool noodles everything looks great. I can see the blind spot fine from the driver seat if I turn my head(which I always do). Had to wrestle with the seat strap to get it tight enough but thats expected if you want it installed correctly. I had to use 5 pieces of pool noodles(bought 2 and made six pieces out of them) so that the read line is almost parallel to the ground. I have it in rear facing position.I must say that the way the seat is my 8 month old can touch the back of the car seat. Also I can see how it won't be super easy to put her in and out like it was with the baby carrier. Once she grows up so that I can use it in forward facing position it will be easy.",5
3240,"Interestingly, my child prefers the flip side... The handle... To the blueberry side. The handle, when she sticks it in her mouth, rubs both sides of her mouth at the same time and seems more soothing to her. Also the pacifier is larger than a traditional pacifier. This is definitely a teether made to look like a pacifier but the whole thing is fun for babies to chew on and play with. Mine seems to like the whole feel of it, too.",4
3241,"Easy to install. Durable. Withstands plenty of pulling and tugging from our 1.5 year old. Works as intended to keep toddler out of toilet.",5
3242,"How this can fit a child past 30lbs is beyond me. My DS was 20lbs when I purchased this and I knew immediately that this would not for him past 30lbs. He is tall but slim. At 18mths, being 25lbs and 32in, this aio was already unsnapped in the front and on the very last buttons for the hip snaps. Now at 20mths and 28lbs it is unusable. An almost complete waste of money.It's only saving graces were it's built in liner and the ability to insert another liner underneath the built in.For those having issues drying it here's what I did. I would dry half cycle then turn the diaper inside out and finish the rest of the cycle. This is when is also take out my covers and fuzzibuns laundry bag(which is amazing!!).",1
3243,"Love the brand, but these did not perform as expected. Soaker was too short in front (bad news for a boy). PUL leaked through the stitching. Otherwise, love the fit and design. Maybe just a faulty batch . . .",3
3244,"This was the leaky-est diaper we had.  Sad, because it looked so cute & I really wanted to love it.  I don't know if it was design or just capacity.  Our Thirsties pockets are much more reliable.",3
3245,"It is near impossible to suck liquid from the straws. I could barely get anything out and my son definitely couldn't. The parts are near impossible to clean as well. The only positive thing I have to say is no they don't leak but that doesn't matter if you can't drink from it. Don't waste your time with these.",1
3246,"I love the non-click-to-lock version of these....for whatever reason, the click-to-lock ones we got leak and it is next to impossible to get the little top/flap piece off for cleaning.  The other ones work great and are our favorites though.  Plus they're slightly cheaper.  I have heard similar feedback from several friends as well.",2
3247,"We are using this as a collect all for stuffed animals and it works great. The bin is soft, so it needs to have some things in it to keep it sitting up.",4
3248,"We have gone through numerous woven baskets and cloth baskets for storing our toddlers toys but this is the best storage solution we have found. The woven baskets are bad because the grass or whatever material that it is made of will fall off when your toddler starts picking at it. The cloth baskets are usually too small and flimsy. This storage solution is great since the outside is cloth and the inside has a plastic liner which can be wiped down. I highly recommend this storage bin and we liked it so much we got 2 other patterns!",5
3249,"When I first opened this up, I was doubtful if this would work for our storage needs.  There is no structure to hold the canvas upright and I was concerned about it drooping or not keeping its shape.  But after filling it with my daughter's stuffed animals, I am more than satisfied!  My daughter is 2 and, because of the lack of metal structuring, it is very easy for her to get toys out of this relatively large bin.  If there was metal structuring she would barely be able to reach into it to get her toys.  The bin is well made and so cute!  There are also canvas handles on the side, which is nice.  As to what some reviewers stated about the smell of the plastic lining, I did notice a slight smell but nothing severe, and within 24 hours the smell was gone.",4
3250,"It was HUGE!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! Right now we are using it for blankets until we get our newborn his collection of toys. So happy we purchased this!",5
3251,"I bought four of these containers in different animals. They look sooooo cute in my son's playroom. When he was an infant, I set them around the living room, and he enjoyed crawling over to them and digging through them. They were perfect for sorting toys. Now, I have them on a bookcase in his playroom. They fit perfectly in a standard bookcase (I know lots of reviewers mentioned a bookcase from Ikea, but I just have a wooden bookcase from American Signature Furniture). My son (and my niece) loves to pull them out and dump the contents on the floor. I'm okay with that since I know that I can easily sort the toys when he goes to bed and hide them away again. I have the entire collection of 3 Sprouts items, and these are my favorites.",5
3252,"These are perfect toy bins. The are really cute and a nice size. Hold a lot of toys and great for a lot of rooms/spaces.",5
3253,"These are prefect for storing toys and they're super cute in the playroom. They're pricey though and you can get the same size and quality for much less if you don't need the design. They do fit into the IKEA Expedit shelving which is awesome.",4
3254,"I just love these. They are adorable, fit tons of toys, and i have then in any room in the house where my son's toys might end up. they also organize things in my older daughter's Ikea cube bookcase. But they are so expensive. I wish 3 sprouts could do something to bring the cost down.I have 3 and would like more but just cannot justify the cost.",4
3255,"no offense to this product, i do not have a very good sleeper. she is hard to get to sleep and nothing helps her except rocking and some crying it out. however, this product is very neat and the music is very pretty. It does take some effort to change the batteries and the remote does not work all that great but at least it has one.",4
3256,"I reveived this product as a gift.  It seems very cute - although I am less than impressed with the sounds/lights/movement that the &#34;Try Me&#34; button displays.  In addition I already have a crib mobile and a Baby Einstein activity mat with a similar soother.  I tried to return this item through Amazon's gift returns, but it is apparently &#34;non-returnable&#34;.  When I called Amazon to find out why, they didn't know and couldn't do anything to help me.Make sure that you (or your gift recipient) really wants this before you order it or you will be stuck with it.Goodwill, here I come!",1
3257,"Works well, has many great features and our baby loves it (got this when he was 3 mths). I would certainly recommend this to new parents!",5
3258,"These nipples work just fine, the only thing that would be nice is if the nipple flows were color coded. Because I have kept the lower flow nipples and use those still sometimes when my baby is not super hungry and looks a little tired, so she can drink a little in a slower, lazier fashion the way babies will do at the breast. The flow is imprinted on the edge of the nipple but it is hard to find and see. This problem may be specific only to me.",3
3259,"The nice thing is the nipples and caps fit the same for the 8oz as the smaller 5oz bottles. So you aren't playing a game of concentration and trying to match them all up when you are getting them ready if you have both size bottles as I do.",3
3260,"This was essential for me.  I love how you can adjust the spray which I think is crucial so as not to spray poop all over the place.  Still sometimes happened.  Easy to install.  We have had it on four toilets.  Doesn't always fit them all.  We had to make an adaptar at one house.  Something to check into, but would buy again.  A piece of it broke about a year in, and the company was wonderful about sending the replacement part.",5
3261,"This was thicker than I expected and fit right into my pack n' play.  I didn't like the thin hard bottoms to the pack n play so I bought this instead.  It's also nice because I'm short and so are my arms and this gave me the perfect height to reach in comfortably and pick up my baby.",5
3262,"Pack 'n play is great, but the mattress is horrible. We stay in a hotel that supplied a pack 'n play with a mattress, and we were suprised how well our daughter slept. If you value your sleep, this is a good thing to take with you on car trips!",5
3263,"This is not very soft. It is better than nothing but not nearly as comfortable as his crib mattress. We use a pack and play with mattress when we vacation and I feel so badly for how uncomfortable the mattress is. I keep meaning to look for a new one!",1
3264,"This works perfectly in our Graco pack'n play. It provides more padding for a better nap, night's sleep and comfort.",5
3265,"We got this to put on top of the Graco Pack 'n Play to use as the Bassinet. It fits perfectly in our Pack 'n Play but it is almost stiffer than the padding that comes with it. I think the only advantage of this is that it raises the baby up higher and over time it may soften up and have more give. The Pack 'n Play might be too soft as it is and our baby might be resting on the hard surface now that she weighs more.If you get this, I'd suggest getting a pad like a mattress cover to go over it to offer some padding. It is very washable and waterproof which is great.",4
3266,"This fit perfectly in our Graco Pack 'N Play with Newborn Napper Elite, Vance.  It seemed to help our 9 month old sleep in the pack n play, as we were having trouble transitioning him from a rock n play.  It is firm, but I don't believe it is any firmer than his crib mattress.  : ) We are still working on transitioning to the crib : )",5
3267,"Perfect fit for my pack and play. It is light weight, thick and comfortable. Worth the money in my opinion.",5
3268,"Very hard! Our baby cried when he fell on it in his crib. We returned this item-definitely not for us. We do not recommend this.",1
3269,"Sturdy and comfortable!  My mom bought this for our baby present.  Worth the price!",5
3270,"Works great and fits well on my Graco Pack N Play. Its a great fit. There are no gaps or sliding around. I don't feel like my daughter is in any way in danger of falling into a gap is it is such a snug fit. I also bought a sheet to cover it. I believe American Baby makes a jersey crib sheet and that fits very well with this mattress and is super soft. My daughter loves it. I really feel like this makes her PNP so much more comfortable instead of just lying on the thin mattress that comes with it. The only thing is now that my daughter is older, when she stands up I feel like as she gets older she'll be able to climb out of the PNP more easily because it is so thick and high. Overall I think its worth it and its a great product.",5
3271,"This allows my baby to sleep in the play yard for naps in the daytime.  It is  a secure fit in my Graco.",5
3272,"Good until the rust started coming out the bottom. It is perfect for holding the family's toothbrushes and toothpaste. I love being able to take it apart to clean it. Unfortunately whatever they used inside of it to weigh it down has gotten rusty and is now staining my sink. Now I'm looking to relace it. Waste of money.",2
3273,"this only worked for food that was already soft.  My wife and I used it briefly then decided it was more of a hassle to wash then a fork that would accomplish the same job.",2
3274,"When you have a baby, it seems like every company on the face of the planet wants to sell you some gadget designed to make your life easier. Baby food warmers, baby food makers, baby food processors...it's a racket. This is one of the few things that turned out to be worth it: just 2 pieces, easy to clean, and you can mash up your own food for your baby in a matter of seconds, without plugging anything in.",5
3275,"Get little portable masher, does the job...but not super necessary. I usually end up mashing with a fork out of convenience. I'm a FTM so live and learn, I say! Save your $$.",3
3276,"I bought this stroller to carry into the subway. It's lightweight, easy to collapse and easy to carry with its shoulder strap. I only wish the dirty wheels didn't rub against the shade when folded. The straps are a pain to adjust, but feel very durable.",4
3277,"These bottles are fine, as far as plastic bottles go.  They are teeny tiny and easy for little guys to hold.  But the 5 oz glass ones are better.  These don't really have a good weight to them, so my son ends up playing with them in his mouth, when he should be drinking.  They also slip out of his mouth, and because they're so light, it's harder for me to feel it during dark, nighttime feedings.More importanly, Born Free (recently bought by Summer) now offers a trainer cup, which comes with sippy spouts and is fully interchangeable with the other Born Free bottle parts and nipples.  Overall, this is a more economical option&#8230; you can buy more nipples of your choice (we use the Dr, Brown wide nipples) really cheap.  The &#34;Summer Training Cups&#34; come in nice colors and a thin,  slightly bigger 7 oz size.  I LOVE these bottles and wish I had found them before I bought these teeny tiny plastic ones.We use the glass 5 ouncers at home, and the green training &#34;cups&#34; (with the Dr. Brown nipples) as bottles for traveling, because the plastic won't break when I throw the diaper bag around.  Although, I should probably add that I've never managed to break one of the glass ones, either.I LOVE Born Free bottles.  Please don't stop making them!",4
3278,"Perfect size for little hands and what else can I say, when my 2 year old hurts himself he asks for this owl, so clearly he likes it. He has even taken it to bed with him a few times!",5
3279,"Read the instructions. Always read the instructions. Do  not forget to read all of the enclosed instructions I am not kidding.",5
3280,"We bought this pack and play for my babysitter's house. It's light, simple and compact. My baby naps well in here.Tip for assembling- pull up the sides before pushing the bottom part down!",5
3281,"We purchased this security blankets because our baby loves the larger ones. However, she puts them up to her face at night, so we wanted something smaller that was breathable if it were to get over her face. She really likes to hold onto her mankey when falling asleep!",5
3282,"The muslin material allows my son to be able to breath even when he draps them across his face.  My so sleeps with these every night:)  Plus, I use these blankets as transitional &#34;loveys&#34; for my baby.",5
3283,"I absolutely love the muslin crib sheets-keeps baby cool during warm/hot summer months. However, if you are not careful, they snag really easily on your nails or wedding rings. Otherwise, a perfect buy.",4
3284,"I wanted a breathable organic cotton sheet.  My needs were met in those ways, BUT - I wish this was certified organic.  Companies can make a lot of claims about being organic, but without the certification -- it doesn't hold a lot of weight to me.  I don't really trust Made in China organic, but -- this is the only muslin sheet out there.",3
3285,"My daughter has eczema and she would turn over in her crib and rub her face on the crib sheet.., so I had to find the softest crib sheet possible. I had high hopes for this given the great reviews. However, when I received them, it wasn't as soft and the areas were the prints were on were scratchy. Granted I didn't wash them, I did compare them with a few other sheets to see which ones were the softest and this one just didn't make the cut.",2
3286,"These don't fit on the windows in my car. I do not recommend if you have smaller back windows. I can't comment on the quality of the product because as I said, they don't fit.",1
3287,"These are my favorite Britax accessory I've bought. They really do cling to the windows very easily - you just place them on the window, and they stick. They do a nice job shading my son's eyes so that he doesn't complain about the sunlight. I only wish that they were a little bit bigger for better window coverage.",4
3288,"These were a cheap quick fix to shade my baby since he wouldn't leave his sunglasses or hat on in the carseat. They are shipped to you twisted in a smaller size (the frame is a twisty metal like some of those folding sunshades you put across the front window). Once the &#34;tinted&#34; plastic gets used to being normal size again it will *mostly* lay flat. Don't expect these things to easily stick to your window. My advice is to lightly wipe one side with a wet wash cloth to slightly moisten it. Once it's moist place the moist side against the window and rub all the air bubbles out with your hand. It *should* stick. The entire shade will not stick but it will stick well enough and once it sticks and dries completely it stays in place. I have had one in my car and my husbands car for over a year now without problems. Don't forget and accidentally roll down your kids window... this makes the shade angry and you may have to reattach....",4
3289,"My husband loves these as an alternative to the shades that fit over the window.  They never need adjustment and the kiddos can't mess with them as easily.",4
3290,"These are pretty good, however, I can't wait to have the windows tinted so that we can remove these.  Not able to open windows.",3
3291,"They did fall off at first, but I think I need to clean the glass.  They are staying properly now, but you can't have anything in the way, have clean glass, and smooth them on well.",4
3292,"They are small and doesn't cover the entire window as a result you still get sun rays inside the car.",2
3293,"They look cheap and don't seem to be very effective at dimming the sunlight. I still have to shield my child's baby carrier with a carseat canopy or blanket to keep the sun out of her face.  Very disappointing.",2
3294,"These shades are good for their intended use.  Even in the 90-100 degree Los Angeles weather they stick appropriately without issues.  The only thing we wish is if they covered a larger surface area.  The shade itself is difficult to see though when trying to get a 360 degree glimpse of surrounding traffic as well.  Will recommend but there might be better products out there...",4
3295,"These are great. They cling wonderfully, and can be moved over and over. No problems so far, and we've had them for over 3 months.",5
3296,"We had a set of these for my first and he kicks and kicks and beats on them. This is our second set for a new addition. They are great and prevent your seats from becoming black from kids shoes. The pockets at the top are a nice bonus even though they don't hold too much.  I have a midsize SUV and it fits my seats perfectly.",5
3297,"I bought these to cover the back of the front seats of our new van. I have had no problems with either of the straps. The pockets up top are great for little things (we have matchbox cars and sun glasses in there). I didn't want any pockets on the bottom because my son would just kick them and get them dirty. I still put stuff in the seat back pocket and the kick mat covers it so it doesn't get dirty, but is still accessible. Great product, awesome price!",5
3298,"My little girl was born average sized but quickly grew and we only used this insert for about a month before she got too big to use it in the car seat. It's really soft and fits well in the Britax B Safe. But although it was springtime, I did notice that she easily got sweaty when we used it despite normal temperatures.",3
3299,"This pillow works beautifully in our Britax stroller.  Sometimes with a smaller baby it's nice for it to stretch out and get out of the infant carrier for stroller rides.  This pillow is supportive and super cozy!",5
3300,"These are very soft and comfortable to wear. I would recommend these breast pads for nursing moms. They wash and dry nicely and don't show much wear. My only complaint is the bright pink shows through my thinner bra and is visible through light weight clothing. Otherwise they are great!",5
3301,"I am using these as an aid in night time potty learning. I also bought the Imse Vimse as well as a SuperUndies. I like these best. Although they are a bit snug and not easy to get off and on, which is a con if I want my son to do it on his own, for my purpose, which is mostly contain nightime accidents, these are perfect. They are low profile, not bulky at all, feel luxurious and soft. I will be ordering at least 2 more.",5
3302,"Very good quality training pant.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the sizing is off.  Size medium is supposed to be up to 45 lbs, my son is 32lbs and it is very snug prior to being washed.  I'm hoping it does not shrink.",4
3303,"Love these! They are so nice to put in the freezer to help relieve soreness in the first few weeks of breastfeeding. They can also be heated to help with plugged ducts too which I occasionally get. I really appreciate the covers that come with them too. I think these are a must have for any moms who plan on breastfeeding! I would recommend you get them while stile pregnant that way you will have them ready for when baby is born and your milk comes in.",5
3304,"This didn't seem like it was worth the money to me.  It didn't stay cold for more than 10 minutes after being in the freezer.  I didn't try it warm, but I didn't have a reason to.  I wouldn't recommend to a friend, there are other alternatives that would be cheaper and easier like an ice pack or warm washcloth (items around the house).",2
3305,"I love these! I tried another pad system that was non-reusable and cold. This one is great because I typically respond to heat better than the cold. The heat easily unplugged my clogged milk duct in my breast. That resolved a huge amount of pain.",5
3306,"Didn't work for engorgement but it's comfortable to put those things on after heating them. Didn't try cold version yet.",3
3307,"I haven't had an opportunity to try out the actual gel/bead pads.  They seem like they will work fine.  The covers, however, are no bueno.  They're cheap, and I'm not even sure what the fabric is called.  They'd be much better in a cotton.  As is, if I were to put them in contact with my skin, they'd make me itch to no end.  Probably just going to throw them away.  I'll have to figure out something to use as a cover.(Posting under my husband's account...)",3
3308,"These offered such a relief for those first two weeks of BF. They fit perfectly and I love how I could use them warm or cold.",5
3309,"These cups are wonderful they make it so easy to transition into a regular cup! The are spill poof and look like a real cup but help mom have peace of mind  transitioning  to the regular cup.",5
3310,"These are cute and leak proof but its really hard to suck liquid out. I thought it was just my baby having a hard time figuring out because she is breastfed but I tried and you really have to suck hard. I wouldnt recommend this especially for babies under one.",3
3311,"The holes is the nipple are too small for the baby to suck.  My 6 month old was spending a tremendous amount of energy trying to drink water from it.  However, the handles on these are good for them to hold the cup.",3
3312,"the cup is fine, I bought it because my almost 2yr old recognizes Hello Kitty and I thought this would be a good bedtime cup.The image looks blurry, like maybe the stamp moved when they were stamping it on the cup. That is disappointing, since I bought the cup mostly for the picture, and paid more for this cup for the picture.I don't know if I am going to send it back, but I would not have bought it if I would have seen it in a store. I think maybe when the factory messes up they sell the product online just to try to get it it sold knowing that I probably don't want to take my kid to the post office to return a $6 cup.....",3
3313,"This gym is on our &#34;top ten&#34; list of the best and most important things we bought baby. I will admit we have been buying things like crazy for our first little one, but we've tried to stick with the guidelines of organic/non-toxic/environmentally friendly. I love that this gym is wooden and classic looking, especially when you compare it to all the plastic and synthetic options out there. What's even better is our baby LOVES it and has seemed really ahead of the curve when it comes to hand eye coordination and spacial awareness.",5
3314,"I think the flow was slow enough that my baby could get the hang of sippy cups.  I had bought a nuk before and it just was too much for her.  However, this one has lots of parts to clean.  Now that she is comfortable with it, she actually likes drinking from the nuk ones too which only have three parts to clean.",5
3315,"My son loves sophie,, So I got him this one just to throw in my diaper bag or car so I don't have to carry sophie everywhere. It is kinda expensive so I was expecting a good quality. it turns out, it is NOT... The bottom part of the vulli has become black. I just cannot remove it(tried scrubbing, sterilizing) and I am scared to give this product to my son. I don't know how it became so dark at the bottom, upon sterilizing or if the thing is peeling?? I don't know,, but it looks dirty at the bottom.",1
3316,"I'm having twins so I ordered this set thinking it was 2 of the FIRM sophie teethers. It actually Is one soft HOLLOW teether( for when baby is younger) and one original FIRM teether. These are NOT counterfeit as some have said. If you read the box it clearly states the difference in teethers. I LOVE THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT and just ordered another set so both babies have one of each. The seller does not state the difference in the the description of product which might add to the confusing of what you are getting. However many other companies sell this same duo set of teethers. Great price for 2!",5
3317,"We purchased this car seat after lots of research. The top of the line safety ratings were incredibly important, and the anti-rebound bar is unique to this car seat. Our son was premature, only 5 lbs 5 oz when we took him home and we have never had issues with the seat. Our baby fit perfectly fine from the day we took him home. He seems to find the seat very comfortable, constantly falls asleep in the car. I love the extra head support the seat has because even when he had poor neck control, his head was always upright and straight. He is now close to 4 months and everything is still great. That being said, there are 2 things I don't particularly love but will definitely tolerate due to the fact that my son seems to love it and the safety ratings are great. First off, when people say this car seat is large, it is! We have a 2008 Acura MDX SUV and the car seat forces the front passenger to give up leg room. If you're tall, it would prob be difficult to sit there with the car seat in place. The second thing I don't love is the fact that the car seat is heavy. On a side note, I would imagine most car seats are heavy, and for us, we mostly leave the carseat in the car and take the baby in and out of it for convenience. We also have a Britax stroller which has the click-n-go system which means all I have to do is pop the car seat into the stroller and I'm ready to go. So, that being said, the weight is not too much of an issue for us as we rarely have to carry it. Overall, great car seat, would definitely recommend to any parent.",5
3318,"It's just OK, but the way it's designed the &#34;tray&#34; part slants down toward the baby, creating a food slide right into your kids lap. Lot of fun. Not. But it is a high chair that is portable and will do in a pinch.",2
3319,"We have used this high chair countless times, however we've had to stop using it because our 1yr old is too big to get in and out of the chair easily.  He still needs a high chair, and we're a bit disappointed that this one is so snug.  However, when he did fit into the chair it was great, he loved being in his chair and it's super easy to set up, clean, and transport.  We had a good 8 month run with this chair, definitely will keep it around for baby No. 2.",4
3320,"Love that they don't leak and my daughter enjoys drinking from them. They are dishwasher safe. We leave the 2 inserts out to dry after washing to protect against mold. They do require you to make sure the tab on the inside is put back in correctly In order for them to work but then again most of the good cups do",5
3321,"We've gone through many sippy cups with no luck and these ones finally worked for our son. He loves them and so do I. They're cute, sturdy, and easy to hold. We've had no leaks or problems with the inner filter coming apart. It did take him a day to get used to the flow of these but he's a pro now. I do like that the spout is hard but also kind of soft too. Also, the age recommendation is 7-12 months but he would have been too young for these then. As a breastfed baby, he's just getting used to drinking from straws and sippy cups at 17 months old. So don't be too bothered by the age recommendation if you think they'd work for your older toddler.",5
3322,"My baby has used this napper since he was a newborn until the 2 1/2 months. Now he is 4 months and we continue using the napper as an ocassional chair. He still loves the cute toys and the sweet melodies that helped him to sleep. I can not recommend this product enough. The sweet melodies that come with the napper will be always on my mind as a beautiful memory of the time my baby was born.",5
3323,"Bought this Tiny Love for my daughter's new born baby. She never used it because the sides are not visible. She ended up using a little bassinet that she put in their bed. My daughter ended up using this Infant Napper : Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Bedding. It has mesh sides so the parents can view their baby all the time when it's in bed with them.",1
3324,"Our baby slept in this every night since birth through 10 weeks old when we transitioned her to her crib in her nursery. I love that I could reach out from bed and rock her with one hand, and the vibration option often helped her settle down. The ability to use this as a seat and a rocking chair also extended its life quite a bIt. I'm all for purchasing baby gear that grow with baby or have multiple uses. However, I could only give it 4/5 stars because our baby quickly became too tall for this which was a shame.",4
3325,"Our 8 month old would find every single tag on every item and chew and eat them. So naturally we thought he would love this taggie blanket. Unfortunately, I think it's a bit of overload for him and he doesn't know which tag to chew on. So pretty comical he only chews on the white one that looks like a tag on any other item. I'm sure some babies are fascinated by all the tags but our baby only gravitates to the one that looks like the others.",3
3326,"This is such a cute pacifier can't wait for my newborn niece to start using it so I can take photos. Seems very durable and the colours are so vogue!",5
3327,"Cute changing pad cover; matches jungle theme; washes well; fits the padBaby likes the design! I bought another one from the same company.",5
3328,"These covers are great. I bought the Owl one too. They don't shrink in the dryer and are super soft. They have been easy to clean and have not become stained from poop landing on them.",5
3329,"My kids have no problem drinking in these cup. The straw seems to work properly. The only problem i have is cleaning it, the silicone straw in the cover as seen in picture can't be detached, if i put it in top rack of dishwasher it doesn't get cleaned thoroughly. So better to hand wash everything. The lower portion of the straw is easily detach for cleaning and it is hard plastic. I like the twist lid for hygienic purpose. I got the soccer/ baseball design for my daughter and son. Item arrived in secured packaging. So the double wall insulated cup are intact.This is an add on item so i went to order it even it says for ages 18/24M. My kids are older, 3 and almost 5. But trust me they still need non spill cups as they find ways (intentional/ unintentional) to make mess when using regular drinking cup.",5
3330,"I use this on my Volo and it stays snugly in place no matter how many times the stroller gets tossed in and out of the trunk. Not super flexible with size, but I haven't found a cup that doesn't work yet. I guess if you drink Big Gulps you'd be in trouble. But anything normal fits just fine.",4
3331,"I just needed a little something to have a water bottle in during my daily walks.  I think it is perfect.  It is easy to put on and snap off, which is important, because if your folded up the stroller with it attached, it could get bent or broken off.  Overall I was worried about the ease of putting it on and taking it off, but my worries were unwarranted.",5
3332,"Washes great. I did hang to dry.  Fabric is comfortable, soft, cute, and fits great in the restaurant high chairs and store shopping carts.",5
3333,"i got this cause my daughter loves the crinkly noise and she only had a mat that made that noise and it was started to bunch up in the fabric, i got this for her and she loved it, we are still using it now at 11 months.",5
3334,"My kids love the &#34;crinkle&#34; in this book and the rubber pieces they love to bite on while teething. One of their favorite toys bought when they were 6 months.",5
3335,"super cute book. great gift to give for baby around the 5 to 6 month mark. love that it crinkles and has taggies on it.",5
3336,"This is my daughter's favorite toy by far. She loves the texture of the &#34;pages&#34; and the crinkling noise it makes. She loves teething on it and examining the bright colors and images. She smiles when she sees it. She got it around 4 months old and 2 months later she is still fascinated by it. It's not really a &#34;cookbook&#34; unless you consider 3 images and numbers on a page a cookbook. But it does have a pocket inside where you little one could &#34;store recipes&#34; one day - or whatever his/her little imagination can come up with. It was worth the money, and she really enjoys it.",5
3337,"Got this for my 5 mth old and she loves how crinkly it is and fun pieces to chew on.",5
3338,"This was bought as a gift for a friend.  It is cute and she liked the buttons on the bottom.  The only negative comment was the quality of the mirror.",4
3339,"Does not attach the way they show it I the picture and stay that way so I couldn't ever see my baby. Facing forward now she's loves it. It is very sensitive though. When we go over bumps it will turn back on if it was off due to timer. It is very loud even on the soft setting. However I gave it two stars because if you are buying this to see your baby while driving it doesn't work right.",2
3340,"Although it didn't say the model year in the description, I got the 2014 Vista model in Jake yesterday.  I love the carbon frame and assembled it immedately.I wanted to buy this stroller two years ago but didn't as I thought it was pricey.  I went with a the bob jogging stroller and the bumbleride flyer for my first child.  Unfortunately, he outgrew both by age 2 as he is on the taller side and the visor on both stroller covers his eyes.  I cannot fold the visor back without the fabric sitting on his forehead.Now I am pregnant with number 2, I decided to purchase the uppababy vista as there is an option for the rumble seat and a piggyback ride along board for my now 2 and a half year old.  I decided to try out the visor as it is adjustable for taller kids.  To my surprised, he really enjoys sitting in it and can see out clearly.  It also helps that the seat can be upright at 90 degrees which he loves!  He also loves the fact that he is so far above the ground.  It helps later for me when I can see the baby without having to reach too far down.Another concern I had was that black would be too hot for summertime.  The fabric is actually quite cool.  the handle bar can be raise for taller parents.  This is helpful as my husband and I are a foot apart in height.I wish I had purchase this earlier.",5
3341,"I love these little cups.  They don't hold water in any way so they can't mildew.  My 22 month old daughter loves to play with them.  They get used every night unlike some of our other bath toys.  This was a good purchase....",5
3342,"For $3 you really can't complain. I got these for my Freemies (breast pump.) There is one piece that has a straw like part I could never get a regular bottle brush into. The first time I used one of these I stuck it in the straw part and the curved metal piece on the end of the brush un curled and got stuck in the pump part. It took me 20 minutes to get the brush out using pliers. I almost ruined the piece. I'm much more careful about how far I stick the brush in but, still, you would think there would be a better design for something like this.",3
3343,"These cleaning brushes make cleaning baby's dishes a snap.  Small enough to clean out a straw, the low removal of food residue from those small impossible to reach corners.  They help make a tedious job easy.",5
3344,"Cleaning sippy cups with straws is almost impossible without these. Why are these not available in stores or not sold with double packs of sippys??cleans inside the straws and the valves of sippys. I also use them to clean my reusable straws for my tumblers.",5
3345,"Use these for bottles and sippy cups attachments. Very durable, and my go to for brushes. I like that they have more than 1 skinny brush since that one is very commonly used across all drinking devices. I'd like to see a bigger nipple brush though.",4
3346,"This is such a great blanket to give as a gift. It is super soft, warm and easy to care for. I always buy these as gifts because they are so decently priced and long lasting. Young babies enjoy laying on them for tummy time because they are soft and well padded. As the baby grows into a toddler they enjoy the patterns on the blanket and love the soft comfort as they snuggle to sleep. I have personally washed these Carter's printed Velour blankets MANY times and they retain their size, softness and patterns without fade. This should be a must on a baby registry.",5
3347,"These are definitely spill proof. We have had no issues with leaking and the handles are perfect for the little hands to grasp!",5
3348,"Pros:  Thin (This is a good thing as temperatures here are typically in the 90's during the summer).  Cute design.  Easy to machine-wash.Cons:  None!Overall:  Wife is looking for more blankets just like these.  She loves them.",5
3349,"Purchased this as a gift for my nephew. Shipping was speedy and it came undamaged.He absolutely loves it, and it is fun watching him wheel it around. Lots of pockets. The backpack strap on the back is great for adults.",5
3350,"These are great.  They stay in place (I even have trouble getting them off sometimes).  My one year old tries and tries to remove them with no success.",5
3351,"I really like the look of these vs the square ones.  They are pretty hard to get off but I think that is kind of the point.",5
3352,"I love these knob covers.  My son can't figure them out (neither can visitors) but my husband and I can easily open doors.  We will likely be buying more of these soon!",5
3353,"We use this to keep our oven door shut. Our toddler has never come close to being able to open it. It's sturdy and easy to apply. Our toddler pulls on the oven door and so far these latches have stood up to all that tugging (been using them for about a year).",5
3354,"This is a nice product for child safety! I use these on my lower kitchen cabinets and on the cabinets in my bathroom. They are easy to operate for adults, but difficult for children because of the grip strength required to open them. The humidity in my bathroom and the moisture in my kitchen near the sink area has not affected these items. I could not be happier with this purchase!I like these much, much better than the side by side locks, which I find very difficult for adults to operate. Example of the kind I don't like: http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Cabinet-Decor-2-Count/dp/B005XTCPFQ/ref=pd_sim_ba_20?ie=UTF8&refRID;=01WRGFTJDD1BXMTBSG76",5
3355,"We use these on our kitchen drawers. They're perfect - plenty hard enough for the toddler, but not too hard for our kindergartener or us. Great piece of mind! The only thing they did't work for was out toilet, which I had hoped to use them on. They would not stick to the curved bowl, but I don't fault them for that - nothing flat would stick to the curve. But for everything else, they've been great! (We have I think 8 - 12 of them).",5
3356,"I seriously use these things every where. As long as you don't mind the looks of them...on my refrigerator , dishwasher, oven, nightstand drawers, cabinets. Great product!!!",5
3357,"put in apartment. when moved able to gently scrape off adhesive. kept baby out despite her curiosity and wanting to play. now if only i can get daddy to reliably put them back on ...",5
3358,"WE originally bought these to keep our curious toddler out of the fridge. I bought a few other fridge locks first and the glue never held and my daughter was always able to break the locks. These however are strong! She has tried countless hours to break them and it does not work. In fact when she figured out how to unlock the standard cupboard locks I purchased these to replace them and I also installed on on my front screen door to keep her in.  I sometimes wonder if they'll be difficult to remove considering how well the glue holds but I suppose I'll have to cross that bridge when we come to it.",5
3359,"We have a pantry that has double doors, with knobs spaced very far apart and I had no idea how to keep my toddler out. This was the perfect solution. Strong enough and works perfectly.",5
3360,"I purchased this to keep my toddler out of the fridge. its surprisingly very durable, I also placed one on the garbage can.",5
3361,"These work great on our kitchen drawers (where other child locks won't fit on).  They save my sanity!  We have also used them on our entertainment center successfully.",5
3362,"I bought this to prevent my 22 month old son from opening the refrigerator door.  I was surprised how well it works on the refrigerator!",5
3363,"I have this latch on my fridge. I probably wouldn't affix this to wooden cabinets because the adhesive is strong and might damage your finish when it is removed. It is extremely easy to use yet effective. My toddler loves to help me cook, but he was wandering into the kitchen and opening the fridge to take food out at all times of the day. Want an egg right now mommy? Thanks, buddy. Now that we have this latch I don't have to worry about toddler fridge foraging or cold storage of toy cars. He doesn't have the coordination to press the buttons to open the latch yet-- it requires both dexterity and finger strength that toddlers don't normally have. But he does clip it shut for me if I forget it, which makes me chuckle. Thanks for being such a good helper and helping Mommy keep you out of the fridge!",5
3364,"Works we'll in securing the doors of our Ikea furniture and fairly straight forward for an adult to open when needed. Only marked as 4 stars as the item is larger than I believe is necessary. The concept could work with the 'squares' being half the size and I,d prefer that. However I am sure that is just subjective.",4
3365,"I like that it has no bells and whistles--literally.  This makes my daughter the star of the show (and the sticker she gets for a successful trip, of course)...I find all of the lights/sounds of the new potties to be a little redundant and tedious.  I mean, how much of a party are we throwing here???  This is nice- it sits very neatly in her &#34;area,&#34; and she loves it.Quick things about it, though: it is pretty small.  Like, it looks like it would be best for a small/short toddler.  My daughter, though is really tall and brawny and still loves it, so I say give it a try anyway.  You never know.The stickers on it don't come off very easily, but she loves to sit there, picking at it while we're waiting for her to...you know...so again, whatevs.  I'm not trying to showcase this as an objet d'art in my bathroom or anything.  I'm sure they'll come off completely in time.The one actual problem?  It could really use some non-stick pads or whatnot on the bottom.  It slips and slides all over the tile floor (which I assume most of us have in our bathrooms)- I have been looking to find solution to this but I just can't bring myself to put a &#34;rug&#34; type deal underneath it.  Most of them have pretty noxious fumes and then on top of that they can just be just plain gross- (kid+potty training+rug=ew).  I mean, I am pretty close to just seeing if I can coat the rim on the bottom with something, but seriously--by the time I figure the science out behind it, she'll be done with it.  :)Overall, I really like it.  It's super easy to dump out/ clean/ sanitize, too.",4
3366,"I am a mother of six and I have had this product for over a year now and it is the best I have ever used. Simple, easy to clean, easy for my toddler boy and one year old girl to use. I love how it is basic and not all complicated and dressed up!!! Buying one in pink now that my girl wants to use it all the time!!",5
3367,"I purchased this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it.  Every week she is able to move more and more.  I was a little worried about the stairs in our home, they are open and we are not able to fit them with a gate.  This walker states it has brakes and can lock when front rollers hit a lower area.  We tried several times and different ways and IT WORKS....It absolutely locks and will not move, when front wheels go past floor area onto open air on step.  We are very happy with the walker.",5
3368,"Our baby doesn't seem to chew on any of the teething toys for very long.  I was hoping he would like this one.",4
3369,"It's beautiful and matched all our furniture. I am very happy with this crib. Easy enough installation. I give this 5 star!!!",5
3370,"I was really excited about using this, even though it did take me forever to take it out of the box and put it on. When I did, boy was I disappointed! While it's a great idea for storing cash and cards and other small things, the cup holders are terrible. No matter how smooth the ride, the organizer rocks with the movement of the stroller and causes every drink to spill. Hot drinks are especially concerning because with the position of the organizer, a hot drink could spill right onto the baby's head.",1
3371,"Nice and sturdy and good quality.  The cup holders are smaller (as many reviews mentioned) but good size for water bottle, small soda or similar.  Not recommended for hot drinks (but do you really want a hot drink by your baby?!)  Overall good quality for the price and fits perfect with my baby jogger mini select GT stroller!",5
3372,"I love all Britax products, it fits my b-agile stroller perfectly, and is great quality. I just wish it was a little cuter.",4
3373,"We are a large family and 1 cup holder doesn't quite cut it for us, so this organizer with 2 cup holders is perfect.  it is soft and straps right on the Britax B-Ready Stroller.",5
3374,"This is a great stroller, we were debating between this and uppababy.  We chose britax because of its price, more economical compared to the uppababy line.  Even though it folds down pretty well, it is a really large stroller when pushing it.  We don't mind that it's bigger than all other strollers we've seen, it securely holds the car seat, toddler seat, and bassinet and easily can be removed.  The big wheels also gives a comfortable ride.  I don't see anything wrong with it",5
3375,"After tons of searching, I found the Britax B-Ready and love it.  It is very well made.  It takes 35 lbs of pressure to flip it backwards which is greater than any other stroller I looked at.  This is so important if you are frequently around younger children that may pull on the stroller.  The adjustable handlebar works well and will allow all of us to push the baby around comfortably.  The height of the stroller seat and reversible seat options were one of the big selling points.  The seat is light weight and can be easily turned around for parent child bonding time, or even an undistracted nap.  The hood is awesome and the perfect size.  The frame is heavy, but that is what adds the stability, so I am pleased with it.  If you have a small car, you will need to make sure it will fit BEFORE you purchase this stroller.  I drive a large SUV and it takes up about half of the trunk space if I have the 3rd row folded up.  If I have the 3rd row in, it takes the entire rear space of a Toyota Sequoia.",5
3376,"Very strong and secure, no box spring required to hold it in place. My toddler has always preferred the bed to the crib conversion and this helps make it safe and secure for sleeping. We love it.",5
3377,"my daughter loves putting all her toys back in the scoop, it looks unobtrusive and i like that it has a shelf for shampoo etc.  all though it did fall off the wall once when i had it full...but maybe i was too hasty sticking it to the wall and i didnt prep the surface well enough.  it hasnt fallen since and it is really full of toys. i reccomend",5
3378,"Much better and way more comfortable than disposable pads. Heat shape is odd but works.",4
3379,"This stuff kicks the snot out of borax, oxyclean and bleach/ chlorine free bleach. Gets construction site grime out, gets 5 year old white towels looking new and my cloth diapers still look new. Doesn't do anything for smells, just looks. If you need to get smells and deodorant/sweat grime out you need sport wash. This stuff works best if you are not using the cheap junky detergent in the first place.",5
3380,"I use this for my cloth diapers along with my Charlie's Landry Soap and it really brightens things up. I can definitely see a difference and I love it. Will keep buying!",5
3381,"it says is cotton but It thought the fabric is going to be thicker, but it is really thin.i do not think it is going to dry my baby but i have not tried yet.price is ok",3
3382,"Very cute and soft. Good value with 2 towels and 2 wash cloths. Seems to be made well. This is a gift so they haven't been used as of yet.",5
3383,"I bought this item from another mom in my social group.  I bought it from her for $15 used.  I probably would never  spend $50 on one.1. I was worried a little bit about the volume of the noise maker right in his ear, but when I switched the end and put the incline piece on the other side, my baby kept kicking the light on and off! So I didn't use the sound (but it is a nice feature)2. Once the baby started rolling, he didn't really stay in it, or he would wake up.  So it only lasted about 3 months.3. If your baby is disturbed by hitting sides or end, it may wake them up.  I think if they start sleeping in it early, they would get used to it.  I know there is a similar product that the bottom part is open to allow for leg growth.Overall, it was helpful to contain the baby in our bed, especially for my husband who was paranoid about rolling onto him.  Just a little short-lived.  I passed it on to my sister who is expecting.",4
3384,"Bought this as a diaper cake topper and it worked perfectly.  It's a cute Taggies toy that came as advertised.",5
3385,"When I received this chime ball, I was disappointed that is was not completely round like a ball.  I was able to somewhat maneuver it into a round shape.  Granddaughter hasn't arrived yet so not sure how she will like it, but judging from other babies reactions to similiar chime balls, I feel sure she will enjoy the noise it makes and the numerous tags to chew on.",4
3386,"For an expectant family member, they really liked it and it looks nice and well made.  I am sure the baby will get lots of use out of it.",5
3387,"Likes:- cool to touch- ability to have different colors/choose your colorsDislike:- most of colors are too bright to be used as a night light",4
3388,"This baby mattress may be the best mattress in our house! The quality is far superior to that of others we have shopped for and even the one we had for our first son which we thought was decent (at about 25 lbs/18 months it started to fail). I foresee this mattress lasting longer without sagging as it is very well made. One side is slightly firmer which is what you want for your growing youngster especially if you plan to use or convert into a toddler bed using this mattress. We are very pleased with this purchase!",5
3389,"very good product and would have no problems recommending it to other buyers, has no leaks when used with the appropriate bottle",5
3390,"I didn't notice in the description of the item that these have 3 holes, so I cant use them unfortunately yet.",3
3391,"I feel silly rating a pacifier. I believe babies either take one or don't AND many times, what they're given in the hospital is what they continue using. We got these in the hospital so I ordered more. They came in the same package you see in the store and they worked the same.",5
3392,"I love the quality of these. I just wish they made like a 10 pack lol. My wife and I had bought bottles without noticing they were size 2, so we had to buy some of these since our son choked a lot on those.",5
3393,"I love these nipples theyre the most natural shape i've found and my baby had no problem switching between these and breast and back again.",5
3394,"a very good product with excellent quality, no complaints about that I own and I want to recommend it to other buyers without any problem, has no leaks when used with the corresponding baby bottles",5
3395,"My toddler and infant both love these sippies, since there isn't much resistance to get the liquid out (some sippies are ridiculously hard to drink out of) but these straws are total junk. They're thin and if your child bites on them at all, they rip. We ordered these replacements, and they ripped within a couple months. Really need to find a new sippy to switch to, but my toddler is pretty resistant to sippy change. The sippies also leak like crazy after a while.",2
3396,"Since my daughter is in a rear facing car seat, I was concerned about not being able to see her but thank to this Brica I have felt at ease for the past 20 months being able to see her and the night light is a plus",5
3397,"I am impressed they do not leak, made in the USA, made of recycled material. The only down side is it is too big for a one-year-old hands to hold. I wish they put handles on making it easier for little people to hold on to it.",5
3398,"I love these plates.  They are deep and a great little sturdy plate. They gave held up great in the dishwasher.",5
3399,"Great little bowls. I like how they are made out of milk cartons. They are the perfect size for  what I need them for.",5
3400,"I have had them for a few months and the are holding p well. I have NOT experienced any fading or peeling. The quality is great and strong.",4
3401,"I like how these were made out of milk cartons.  They are very sturdy and great colors. Will be buying more.",5
3402,"Save some money and get the forks made from metal. Plastic forks just don't work very well wehn they are learning to eat with utencils.",3
3403,"I really like this car seat I bought it for my oldest son I have not yet used it with my youngest but will like the quality.it could decline it works good in my car but does not work good in the truck you have to sit it out which is fine I like this  car seat",4
3404,"protected some thumps but doesn't stay on very well. would like to stay on better. perhaps better adhesive? did prevent a few thumps. not very many good options out there though.",3
3405,"Great pacifier clip and works really well. If u tired of the pacifier falling get this clip!!! Great clours available plus name section to identify owner :)",5
3406,"joint to the pacifier, helps calm the baby a lot,....really helps calm the baby a lot and maintain the pacifier clean",5
3407,"Believe me - spend the money on this clip, you'll never lose it! I've had other cheaper clips and they've all gotten lost. Spend the $6 on this one and you'll never need another.",5
3408,"Love this thing.  First time trying one of these with this type of clasp.  Works great.  Really cute and very gender neutral!",5
3409,"I always get compliments on how cute this is!  At first, I didn't like how hard the clip was to do/undo, but it's really convenient for when baby starts to grab and tug, and you get used to it.",5
3410,"It has only fallen off/been pulled off by baby once. Works great all the time and is cute. Works with various brands and styles of pacifiers.",4
3411,"When I saw this item I knew right away that it was a keeper.Will be able to keep track of where pacifier is and not have to &#34;search&#34; for it.  Simple but smart device.Was a gift to our daughter and husband for their first child.",5
3412,"Very cute and useful. Must have if you baby uses pacifiers. I got this for my daughter-in-law, she is expecting soon...Mothers can use all the help they can get! Seem to be made well.",5
3413,"My four children used one of these and they loved it, but that was 20 years ago and this one just doesn't work as well as I remember the old one working.  My 7 month old Grandson enjoys it for 20 minutes or so but he can't really get it to jump very well.  The old one tipped babies forward so they were not sitting on their delicate new spines; this new one doesn't do that so that was disappointing.  The old ones had straps along the baby's sides to hold them centered; this new one does not so my Grandson tends to tip to one side inside the seat and I have to keep &#34;re-centering&#34; him.  The old ones bounced easily and taught a child rhythm, which is so important in learning to crawl and walk.  This new one bounces stiffly and awkwardly so I don't think it teaches anything.  My Grandson enjoys it for a few minutes so I'm glad I got it, but I'm really dissappointed in it; I was expecting so much more.",3
3414,"I took off the doorway piece and hung this from a tree branch with a strap from a TRX gym. We put sand were his feet touch. Works great for that. I tried in a door way and my son immediately face planted into the door frame, not enough side protection.",5
3415,"I have all hardwood floors in my house and this mat works perfect for my 4 month old to play on. It is also great to work out on.",5
3416,"We were looking for something to put down on our tile floor for our 7 month old daughter to play on instead of just blankets.  These are just perfect!  They are big (both myself and my wife and can lay on them with our daughter and play with her), easy to clean (just wipe them down), light weight, and fairly soft but not super squishy so the baby is able to get good traction when learning to crawl.  I can see these being a permanent fixture in her nursery once she gets a little older.  They break apart and can be stored easily as well.  Awesome purchase for an awesome price!",5
3417,"Fashion over function.... bad mistake. This pad is too thin. My daughter still falls and hits her head and yes it hurts when it's on wooden floors. Keep researching unless you plan on laying this on top of a thick rug.",3
3418,"My baby loves to play in this. Plenty of things for baby to do and work on coordination while strengthening legs",5
3419,"I've had several regular brand exersaucers, but this is by FAR the best. My son absolutely loves the toys. They are all within easy reach and really cute. The only cons are it took a little while to put together and there is a sort of indented ring around where the seat is and crumbs and dust get in there. It's easy to clean out, but a pain. I still HIGHLY recommend this for the entertainment value! Also if your baby has a flat head, it's a good way to keep them entertained and upright.",5
3420,"These things are a great alternative to disposable swim diapers. They dry really quickly and have a few different sizing options due to the snaps. My baby is very comfy in them. One important detail: when they pee, it doesn't hold it at all. Pee goes everywhere which was pretty funny for us the first time it happened. We change her into them before getting in the water and they're great. We will be ordering them in the next size up very soon.",5
3421,"Leaks constantly even with the valve in. Not as soft spouted as I would have expected. Not recommended. I am very happy though with the munckin soft spout sippy cup. No leaking and very cute design.",2
3422,"I really wish it didn't leak so much.  It is easy to drink from and I love that it has handles but it was just too many leaks to deal with when my toddler likes to leave his sippies on the couch.",2
3423,"I use these when we take our 4 year old and 2 year old grankidlets out to eat.  The stickers keep the kids entertained while waiting for the food to arrive.  They are perfect for dropped/spilled foods that would otherwise end up on a table and are awesome for cleanup.  These are adhesive on the sides...non-slipping.",5
3424,"This chair is really small and does not recline back at all. It would be good for grandma's house or shore house and for babies who are sitting unassisted but not that great for at home frequent use. It does fold up better than most other chairs so if you have a tiny space it could be good for you. I can't see this chair fitting my son when he is a year old since he is just 5 months now and already looks too big for it.  It looks nice and it wipes clean easily but not that functional. I wanted to love this but it just isn't happening.",2
3425,"The same as the one that comes with the seat.  We needed extras for the babysitters and grandparents' cars.  Very handy to have extras.  Easy to install, no way of messing up!",5
3426,"I bought our carseat at a local store but needed/wanted another base so we didn't have to switch out the base depending on what car we were using. So happy I found this here and the price was much cheaper than what I was expecting!",5
3427,"We have a base in both of our vehicles. One is secured by latch and the other by seatbelt. Both installs were very easy and the changing incline makes it even easier as baby gets bigger. Base works great with our baby trend seat and we've had no issues!",5
3428,"I had such a hard time with my son ripping off bibs. These bibs are perfect. They stay on, although he still tugs, and they are easy to wash and quick to dry. Have yet to find a downside.",5
3429,"Bold contrast, black and white shapes with some foil and some color, words for later , sturdy and all. The kid loves it.",5
3430,"Love the design and function of these, wish they made an organic option and then they'd be the best clip on the market!",5
3431,"Please read the reviews before purchase.  I wish I had read the reviews, if I had known that I was paying $8 for one clip I would have not purchased the clip.  Nothing fancy about the clip.  The description does not state it's only one clip, I based it on the picture and thought I was purchasing 2 clips.  So deceiving.",2
3432,"These are the best baby spoons that we have.  They work great at wiping food off of the babies face while feeding them.  We only use these now.",5
3433,"These are the best baby spoons because they are flat on the front and slightly flexible, so our son gets the max amount of food off of it each time.  Highly recommend for about 2-12 month olds.  After that they need a bigger spoon.",5
3434,"This seat liner works ok; the seat liner shifts every now and then, so you have to readjust it. We were surprised that there is no way to latch the seat liner from the top to the back of the seat; an odd miss for Uppababy. Otherwise, the seat liner works as intended and is easily attached/removed.",4
3435,"Helps keep the pacifier close for my boy and my sanity that much closer with not having to listen to him want it and not be able to find it.",4
3436,"We have not had any interference problems. Even with the noise machine running in the baby's room, we can hear his grunts and cries over that. Have had no issues for over a month. Great price.",5
3437,"They have everything we needed. We especially find the sensitivity setting useful since our little one sleeps with white noise. We have found if you leave the sensitivity all the way up it continuously transmits and drains the batteries quickly. With a properly configured sensitivity we go days without needing to recharge them though.",5
3438,"These worked great and we never experienced any interference (we lived in a condo). Compared to so many of the other monitors, these are a great value.",5
3439,"THE BAD NEWS:  These monitors WILL stop working.  It's not that they *might* stop working.  They will.I did not have unrealistic expectations that these monitors would last from my first child through my last grandchild, but I did expect them to at least make it through one kid.  No such luck.  We are on our third set of these and my daughter is only 18 months old.THE GOOD NEWS: vTech WILL replace them!  But only once... there is a way around this though.  vTech won't ask for a receipt or a proof of purchase but they do keep track of names/phone numbers/addresses of people they send replacements to.  All you need to do is make sure to call from a different phone number and send it to a different address every time their shoddy product needs to be replaced.(By the way, when mine broke, I bought new vTech monitors from Target while I was waiting for the replacements then returned the new replacement set to the store and sent the broken set to vTech)THE OTHER GOOD NEWS: These monitors work great when they work!  They have crystal clear sound and more features than competitors in the same price range.  I tried the Sony monitors (same price) and the sound quality was awful.OVERALL:  I would recommend these monitors with the understanding that they will break but that you can get a free set from vTech.",1
3440,"Whenever we leave the window open in the nursery, which is on the back of our house, we get a low level hum from the outside noise, even when the sensitivity is all the way down. It makes t very hard to sleep at night when we crack the window for air circulation.Also, when the parent and baby units get close, they create feedback. When you carry around the monitor with you, it's difficult to remember to take it off and leave it in another room when you go in to check on your baby.",2
3441,"We chose this monitor for a couple reasons. Price was the big one and we didn't need a very large coverage area. This monitor does what it needs to do, has more than enough options (sensitivity, volume, nightlight, etc), and blends in nicely in the baby's room.Things we love:1)Sensitivity can be adjusted very easily. Highest level picks up EVERY noise which is nice for the very beginning, but its also nice to be able to turn it down for when baby gets older and you dont need to hear every single time he rolls, flings an arm, or talks in his sleep.2) Sound alert is very handy for when you are doing something and cant hear the baby. Lights at the top of the parent unit go from green (quiet noises) to red (loud noises) to let you visually see that there is noise coming from the room. Very handy when you are vacuuming or watching a movie.3) Also has a vibrate option if you needed to keep it on you and cant hear or see the monitor. The vibrate option is surprisingly strong. Also very useful.4) Range is perfect for a small to medium sized house (which we have). Even does well when I am outside and baby is asleep inside considering we have cinder block walls. Still works well for us.Things we dont love:1) Really the only thing we dont love is the &#34;night light.&#34; I put it in parenthesis simply because it doesn't do anything. It becomes *barely* an orange glow and is not useful at all. But honestly, this isn't really that important to us because we have the light from the wipe warmer and a turtle light that we use as a night light. Its easier to just press the button on the turtle than to try to fiddle with getting the button pushed to turn the &#34;night light&#34; on on the monitor unit.All in all, we are VERY pleased with this purchase. We have been using ours for almost 18 months now and it shows no signs of wearing out any time soon. Battery life is very slightly lessened, but I consider that normal for something that is used every.single.day. and is recharged so frequently.",5
3442,"After about six months of use the display stopped working on the monitors. They still picked up sound decently well, but it was frustrating to not know the volume level or if they are working correctly. Now after I have had for 18 months, the parent unit has started beeping uncontrollably. I will be looking for a different monitor this time and hoping for better quality. I wish that I had gone with a more expensive and higher quality product from the start, rather than these which need to be replaced in such a short amount of time.",1
3443,"Excellent monitor . We tried quite a few before getting this. We've sine purchased a second for our new baby. The old one recently went out, after about 18 months use :( but it worked amazing during that time . Good range and no interference.",4
3444,"It's just the perfect car seat. My Grand Daughter is very happy with it and so are her mom and dad.",5
3445,"These work well on our closet door and some cabinets that we preferred not to drill a lock into. It is definitely easier to use for me with my small hand than it is for my husband, but we can both open it without much struggle and my 14-month old hasn't cracked it yet.",5
3446,"The amount of safety product for infants/toddlers I have tried is mind boggling. I use this on my closets that have double doors with regular door knobs and on an armoire. Having to depress a button than use two hands to open definitely has stumped my husband AND TODDLER(20mth). Definitely check the fit, if the straps are too tight it might not close properly making it possible for the child to open, too lose and the loops can be pulled over door knobs or if used on a cabinet the doors can be open enough that a slim arm can reach in. Cheaper on amazon than in stores!",5
3447,"I am glad I purchased these.  Sometimes its a little difficult to open if I have them to tight but other than that they are great",4
3448,"Works as designed. It keeps our 15 month old giant out of our cabinets. At first, it also kept adults out of our cabinets, with its clever locking / unlocking system. Once you get pass the child-proofing, these locks are perfect.I would highly recommend this.",5
3449,"The Prince Lionheart Stroller Gate Check Bag is durable and convenient! A definite purchase if traveling with a stroller via air. We've used this gate check bag on three international flights and it has held up very well. Five cool conveniences: Folds up into a neat little sack--great for transporting when stroller is not in it; nifty space for writing family or child's name on the bag; easy to open, spacious, and has a durable carrying strap. Worth the buy!",5
3450,"Made the car seat easier to carry in the airport before being checked. It held up just fine through our two flights and kept the car seat clean. Color also made it easy to see.",5
3451,"A few things I like about this bag:--Large white space to write your name--The green color makes it easily identifiable--Effective top closure--Large size fit our convertible car seat--Sturdy woven handle allows for easier transportation--Did it's job!  This bag came out the other end of the trip with some marks and dings but our car seat was perfectly fine.",5
3452,"My girls were breastfeed and we tried many bottles , almost 100 nothing worked until we found these. They are a wide base and closer to nature looking then most of the bottles out there. They are easy to clean and are very cute! They are easy to pump into with adaptor",5
3453,"i use these to carry my little ones stacks for the day. she can reach in easily and they covers fit the cup version on these for bigger storage.",4
3454,"We have a 9 month old daughter who has started taking soft, solid food to daycare and these are PERFECT for her.  When our first child was born we had purchased these as well as the 8 oz size and they worked great.  Unfortunately over the years we seem to have lost most of the lids for the 4.5 size so we were forced to put the 9 month old's food in the big containers.  They took up way too much space in the daycare center's fridge and there was a lot of wasted space in the containers since she doesn't eat that much.  We were searching everywhere for these 4.5 oz ones but could not find them anywhere.  The baby stores, Wal-Mart, Target, ....  None of them carried the small size.  They only had the 8oz.  Thankfully Amazon.com came through again.  They had what we were looking for and at a price we were comfortable paying.I recommend these containers to anyone who has a infant child or even a toddler that takes their lunch to daycare/school with them.  They hold up well in the dishwasher, don't leak when they are in the lunch bag, and are the perfect size for small food portions.",5
3455,"On sale and great product. Baby doesn't mind it on his face. Not all sunglasses are UVA UVB protected and these are. No complaints so far. Fits my 2 month old baby",5
3456,"Sharp & portable food scissors- perfect for bringing to restaurants!",5
3457,"Love the tranquil turtle...very soothing.  Only complaint is that the batteries didn't work.  Highly recommend.",4
3458,"My ten month old loves her turtle. It projects blue 'waves' onto the ceiling and we alternate between the sweet melody and the ocean waves. She goes to sleep within minutes. I highly recommend this toy for your bedtime routine.",5
3459,"I bought this out of desperation, as most people probably do that spend almost $50 on a stuffed turtle and rushed Saturday delivery. I needed sleep. I needed my 9 month old to sleep. We were going out of town and I figured his number of night wakings would get worse with him getting over tired and getting only car naps for a day as we travelled. I was willing to give Tranquil Turtle a shot. After one of the worst car trips I've ever had with my kids, we got in really late and I was not hopeful that my little guy would get to sleep at all after some car sleep and then being up playing in a new place at 11pm. Go through a modified bedtime routine, read some stories and place little guy in the pack and play, turn on the turtle and leave the room. He talked a little, he babbled, he got quiet. I couldn't tell if he was asleep so I went up to spy and he was sitting up admiring the lovely under water effect the turtle creates in a dark room. I then watched him flop over on his side, raise an arm in the air to wave at the &#34;waves&#34; (I guess in surrender) and by the time I got back downstairs he was asleep. NO CRYING. We've been using the turtle for naps and bedtime for two full days and there have been no long drawn out battles. he just lays there and goes to sleep at some point. Even in the middle of the night if he wakes, turning the turtle back on does the trick. I figure he'll get the button pushing down soon enough. This turtle is magic. I am curious to see if the novelty wears off or if it still has the same effect at home when we are done with our trip. I am really excited to use it in our camper as it's difficult for him to get settled there due to the openness of his bed there and general busier sleeping area. I will update the review when we try it out. I am really really pleased so far with the turtle. The sounds are not too loud and optional. You can make the light move to make a wave like effect or be still. Some people complained that it only stays on for 23 minutes but I think it works out OK as it usually takes LOs 15 to 20 minutes to get to sleep - I think if it went on longer than that it might be a distraction. I suspect my guy is lulled in to this sleepy state as he watches the light show and if still awake when it stops he just nods off to dreamland. So glad I bought it.",5
3460,"I love that I do not have to bring a diaper bag when I have this.I can fit in, 2 shorts, 1 shirt, 4 diapers, wet wipes, small soap, a pack of tissue, a spray bottle, a bib, 2 wash cloths and 2 burp cloth in this.Not only is this very practical, but the design is very beautiful as well.",5
3461,"This is one of the most useful things I bought before I had my baby. The reason is simple. You don't always feel like, or have room for toting the whole diaper bag around. (like when you are just running in to grandma's house, or when you are using your umbrella stroller with the tiny basket) I keep the mesh part stocked with two diapers and the wipes case, and I grab it and go! I leave it in  my diaper bag, so its always with me in the car. I can't stress enough how useful it is! It even has a strap to attach to a stroller or hook over your wrist.When we are in a public place, especially flying, it is SO MUCH EASIER to grab this and take it to the bathroom and lay it on top of a disposable changing pad. It also has a little cushioned pillow part that I'm sure my baby appreciates.",5
3462,"It may be a little bit expensive but is definitely pay the worth. Sometimes if I'm in a rush or I'm going out with my baby for less than 2 hrs, taking the whole diaper bag with us is just too much.I bought 2 of this: one to leave it at my husband's car, another for me. Is so easy to just grab it and hit the road. Enough space for diapers, wipes, rash cream, a onesie, a bib or washcloth. It also comes with a changing mat perfect to a quick (anywhere) change.Easy to clean too, gorgeous pattern! You just can't go wrong with a gift like this.",5
3463,"We cannot recommend this car seat enough, we are happy with everything britax has to offer.  The car seat base installed well, you need strength to really synch down the base but once that's settled the car seat pops on and off very easily.",5
3464,"We have twins so for us there were 3 major deciding factors: 1) How easy is it to pop in and out of the base? 2) What is the safety rating, and 3) Is it compatible with the stroller we want?Since there are few twin strollers on the market, we tackled the stroller question first and settled on the City Select.Pros:1) This car seat is really easy to pop in and out of the base.  There is a simple latch in the back of the seat that you pull and the car seat pops out.2) The canopy is excellent and provides a decent amount of coverage.3)  Great safety rating.4)  Our babies were small when we left the hospital and we needed an insert (Summer Infant Snuzzler) to stabilize their head but they did really well with that simple fix.5)  It fits the City Select stroller with a simple adapter.  The adapter snaps into the stroller and then the car seat snaps into the adapter without requiring any complicated or bulky stabilizing bars or straps. The adapters do not have to be removed to collapse the stroller. If you have twins, the only way both car seats will fit the stroller is if they are both facing you. This places the rear baby below the front baby.Cons:1) We struggled a bit with the base installation (rear facing) because our back seats are sloped (bucket like).  Even though the marker was within the limits of the level and should have been fine, the car seat was tilted slightly forward causing the babies' heads to flop forward as well. There is a recline adjustment button for the base but it wasn't nearly enough to rectify the tilt. It turns out this is not an infrequent problem and Britax has a youtube video on correcting this. I'm not sure if other car seats have more range in the tilt to accommodate for this problem.2) For installing without the base, the seat belt guides are hidden under the cover so it's a pain to access them to install the seat.3) The cushion coverings can be removed but they're not machine washable.4) The car seats are wide relative to some others so it makes your middle seat virtually useless unless you have a really skinny person.5)  This is a MAJOR con.  Because the car seats are wide, there isn't a single or double snap-n-go on the market that fits the car seats. That means you are committed to your stroller as your only travel system. We like our City Select stroller but the frame is heavy and requires removal of the 2nd seat mounting brackets to fit in the trunk.  For short distances, it's a drag to have to set up the frame. At the same time, carrying 2 car seats by yourself is never an option. In retrospect, this may have been a deal breaker and I think I would have tried to come up with another car seat that fit the City Select.",4
3465,"I was in a major car accident(spinning twice) with my 5 month old tucked in this car seat. Not a single scratch(there was small scratch on the finger actually) but nothing, absolutely nothing major... So thank full for this car seat. I cant say enough good about this one",5
3466,"I wouldn't try another infant carrier. I have the b-agile single and double stroller and it is SO NICE to be able to click and go with this car seat! And not that it's that big of a deal, but it's definitely a classy simple gender neutral car seat!",5
3467,"I am a new grandma and bought this for my car to have when I have to put my granddaughter in my car.  It's nice to have my own car seat.  When my other granddaughter comes to visit from out of state, it nice to have this so my daughter doesn't have to bring hers when she visits.",5
3468,"As a mom of 3 soon to be 4, and a 20 employee in the early childhood business, I have experienced almost every kind of carseat.  This seat is safe, functional, and easy to install.  I love the red color as it stands out and adds one additional safety piece that many don't think of.  In case of a crash, the color helps it stand out for ems to identify there is a baby in the car.",5
3469,"This worked alright to give our infant some medicine for thrush and her probiotics but if you didn't use it just right it would leak all over, which is not fun with sticky meds or limited prescription meds. It was the best way we found after trying several syringes, medicine cups, and dropper style dispensers, but still not perfect. It also was a little big for our 4-7 week old.",3
3470,"The dispenser is good quality, but if your child hates taking medicine like mine, this will not fool them at all. Mine screamed. I would rather just hold her tightly and use a regular syringe. I have actually started to play a game with her where I laugh with her as she is taking her medicine. She thinks it's funny to turn her head away then look at me and take a little at a time. Even through her &#34;no's!&#34; she is still laughing. Unless your child is very small when you start using this for their medicine, save your money.",3
3471,"It's pretty light and easy for my son to hold himself.  He likes the different textures that each nob has.",4
3472,"We bought this to go with the Stokke Tripp Trapp high chair (which is terrific, by the way, and well worth the cost. The Tripp Trapp tray is sold separately, however, and ridiculously expensive for a piece of plastic). This tray is also very useful for travel. I love that the top part detaches so you can easily wash it. We have used it since my baby was 6 months old.",5
3473,"I have this wrap as well as a Moby.  I love them both.  The advantage of the Beachfront is that it can be worn in the water and it is much cooler than the Moby.  I feel that the Moby is more secure, but the Beachfront is not unsafe - it just shifts a little more than the Moby as a result of the material.  I haven't worn it in the pool yet, but I believe that it will make both me and baby more confident and relaxed the first time we go in.  I wore it in the shower with her and it was great.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 220 pounds, so I went with the XL and it has plenty of room.",5
3474,"Okay, here's the scoop.I've got 3 kids (under 3...all diff ages 34 months, 15 months, 4 weeks). I bought this because we live in SoCal and like to be outside in the summer. The Moby is pretty warm, so I thought this would do the trick while we are in the pool and/or on vacation and/or out doors. Now, this is ALL based on an infant....maybe an older baby will work better?Pros: Lightweight, good breathing material, wraps like the Moby.Cons: Stretches quick and baby slides around, Fusia is HIDEOUS (don't buy the pink), doesn't get as tight as the Moby, so it feels unsafe.",2
3475,"We've used these jars for about 4 months now, and they've generally worked well.  Washing only in warm water and soap, the white labels are mostly intact though have begun to wear off.  The lids seal very well and have never leaked for us.  When packing them the fact they they click together is a nice feature.On the other hand: They don't really snap into the base very well, so we've ended up not using it. We just stack them upside down in a little tower with the lids separate.  Also, we use the OXO cube tray to freeze our baby food, and you can't even really fit one cube in these cups without thawing.  Each jar can fit 2-3 cubes worth of puree, but you have to thaw them first.  For this purpose, we've actually had much better luck just using 4oz canning jars.  We use the dry erase pen that came with these to label the lids.  They are easier to feed out of too.  So while there's nothing terrible about these cups, I would choose the glass canning jars (bonus: they can go in the dishwasher!). My husband has chimed in that these are a pain to wash.",3
3476,"This was so bad, the zipper is really bad. It has a velcro (the scratchy side) on one side that seems useless. I have other pacifier pouches that are immensely better.",2
3477,"This is an awesome toy and our 4mth old has been kicking it since 3mths now...He loves it. Few great options....the sound is adjustable with few options. I looked for couple good toys for entertainment and this one sure does the trick!",5
3478,"I love this and it works perfectly with my baby trend jogging stroller. We are able to walk and run in the sun without any concerns for our baby's safety.",5
3479,"I can see this being great for some. Its a great item, very well made, very comfy, nice features. My baby liked it just ok. She preferred her swing and I found myself still moving my swing from room to room wherever she wanted to be instead of using this. BUT in saying that I can seriously see some babies preferring this.",4
3480,"We tried quite a few bottles by this point, with my son we first used Medela, then the cheaper Parent's choice/Evenflo bottles, then finally settled on the playtex drop-ins system. He used a slow flow nipple each time and didn't seem to care at all, we used the playtex because I could pump directly into the bottles. (Both children were born early requiring bottles for boosting my milk before they finally got big enough to not need it and learn to latch). My daughter on the other hand is a bit more discerning. Even from early on she liked to nurse so finding the right bottle has been difficult. At first she took standard bottles like Medela/Dr. Brown well, but they put too much air in her little tummy or were not conducive to teaching her to latch. We also tired Born free and those were horrid.  Since I had all of my old playtex storage rings we decided to buy a few drop-ins bottles and they worked the best. Until she started needing a faster flow. So since they worked the best we got the next speed up. However the medium flow was too fast for her strangely enough. My mom had been given a few of these new avent ones, so after hearing that Charli's eating issues were a non-issue at my mother's I figured why not? So I bought the avent manual pump since I needed a manual pump and figured if she rejected the bottle I could still use it to pump into. She is very happy. We no longer have the problems we used to. She used to ""chew/play"" with the nipples, she'd gulp too much air either desperately trying to keep up with the flow or desperately trying to speed it up and would end up puking at the slightest provocation. She still has moments where if she eats too much she spits up but it's no longer from too much air and she has to really be playing hard to start with the spit-up biz. Since I needed more than just one bottle and she will soon be eating 5 oz a feed, I got these. They are the exact same as the 4 oz size just bigger. I love the width and how ergonomic these are. They are easy to clean and hold. The caps pop off easy and it looks really nice. Plus she doesn't seem to need a change in the nipple with these. She likes it just the way it is and seems to be able to somewhat adjust the speed to suit herself. These are also the closest to the real thing I have found. Even more so than playtex. She has no problem going from breast to bottle even in the same feed. (Like if I am soothing her before her bottle is ready because I just pumped lol) Anywho, I really really like these a lot! Definitely worth the expense! Also dishwashersafe!",5
3481,"let me just say that i LOVE these bottles. good for moms who want to breast-feed and use a bottle. the &#34;natural latch&#34; nipple is my hero!however, the ones amazon shipped had black soot everywhere and were scratched. i returned these and bought some at my local target for the same price.",5
3482,"I was so anxious to buy these because I wanted high quality bottles for my baby. However, after using it a couple of times I saw that most of what my baby was drinking was leaking out and for the life of me I couldn't figure it out. The cap was on fine, the nipple fit also but the milk managed to leak somehow.",1
3483,"These are great baby bottles. I also purchased the double breast pump and it is also perfect. It is very well designed, easy to use, easy to clean and the nipples are great, too",5
3484,"My exclusively bf daughter was 10 weeks and wouldn't take bottles. We used Dr. Browns with our son but she did not like those so I bought several different brands including this Avent bottle to try. She did take this bottle but not well. Her favorites were the Tommee Tippe and the Comotomo bottles. She took those very well and then started to take all bottles including the Dr. Browns.I didn't have any issues with this bottle and the materials it's made of seem safe, it just wasn't her favorite.",4
3485,"My baby took to this bottle quick. I had no problems whatsoever. They did last long, I already have my baby on the 9 ounce bottle... I would definitely recommend buying!",5
3486,"Since my husband is the primary user of this product, I asked him for input when rating this product. His quick response was, &#34;I like it. It's easy to use,&#34; thus the not-so-clever headline for this review.In our household, this sterilizer is used multiple times a day... for two reasons: (1) I am an over-producer when it comes to breast milk, and (2) we're cheap and don't want to buy a whole much of bottles. Currently, we mostly use the 5oz Medela bottles and 4oz cheap-o bottles that we got from the NICU.We don't exactly follow the grooves in the sterilizer and have found our own way of arranging the bottles and lids. We are able to sterilize 8 bottles and 8 lids at one time. We also sterilize my pump parts in here a couple times per week. We used to sterilize bottle nipples, but have not in a long time because our 6-month-old baby has a lot of health issues and actually lost the skill and desire to eat orally. We feed him everything through an NG tube right now. (It's hard, but that's the only way we can get him fed these days. Sniff, sniff.) It takes 3 minutes in the microwave, so it's pretty darn quick.Our only minor complaint about this sterilizer is that two of the grooves can sometimes cause the Medela bottles to topple. But we realize that this is probably because this sterilizer was made for Philips AVENT bottles, so we don't feel right deducting any stars for this complaint.",5
3487,"Returned bc I thought this was for easy bottle cleaning but the directions tell you to wash bottles thoroughly before steaming w this item thus what's the point? I guess if you're OCD and want them extra sterile you would like this. ??? Double the trouble and not worth the time.",1
3488,"I'm sure this sterilizer works much better when using only Avent's bottles. However, try using anything else and it comes up far short. Bottles don't stay upright at all which is perhaps my biggest complaint. We ended up donating this sterilizer only after a couple of uses and bought instead the Playtex SmartSteam 3-in-1 Microwave Baby Bottle Sterilizer which is 1000x times better and is much more universal than the Avent Sterilizer.",2
3489,"We like the flatfold diapers for burp clothes.  They are extremely absorbent, soft, and versatile. I would recommend 2 packs, and it's all the burp clothes you'll need.  We don't use any of the other &#34;pretty&#34; burp clothes, because these do such a great job.",5
3490,"we use it as burp clothes and will not go back to anything else. soft and easy to wash and dries up fast as well",5

3493,"I thought it was wi-fi",3
3494,"This monitor made a low clicking noise about every 20 seconds when we had it in use even at the lowest volume setting.  Without any baby noise or background noise the sound lights were flickering constantly.  I couldn't keep the monitor on because it was misleading that something was going on in the baby's room when in fact it was perfectly quiet.  We tried switching locations and directions of the camera and the monitor and nothing helped.  I couldn't find any way to adjust the sound sensitivity.  The video quality was good but the otherwise we were very disappointed in this model.",2
3495,"This is a wonderful monitor! I can finally see what my child is doing! Image is so clear, and so easy to operate. Volume up and down, screen brightness, and video on/off. That's it. No other complicated menus. So glad I got this!!!",5
3496,"This monitor is really great for the price. I can see the small movements of my baby's chest while he's sleeping. I really love looking at this all the time at night to ease my paranoia. However my husband refuses to look at it and gets scared when I turn it on because he says it reminds him of paranormal activity.",5
3497,"we LOVE this mat! It's large enough that my daughter (7 months) can roll on it and play on it and we don't have to worry about her getting on the carpet/floor. We have washes the mat many times and it keeps it qualify each time. GREAT PURCHASE!",5

3501,"A good idea, but probably for 1 year+...My son isn't quite 1 year old, but this cup was a little advanced for him.  Granted, he is in the stage of throwing everything and we just got rid of the bottles.  I think it could work well in a few months once he is more used to drinking from a cup.",3
3502,"I have been purchasing several different types of cups to assist my 2 year old in transitioning from straws to regular cups. He did not like any of them. I ended up giving them away. I decided I would try again when I saw this on amazon. It arrived yesterday. I gave it to him, he said ""thank you"" and started drinking from it right away. He had a few spills the first few gulps and then he got used to it and it will be real cups from here on out. THANK YOU for this great product, I am going to order more today... THANK YOU!!!6.23.2014I wanted to update this review. I have had this cup for about one week and I decided that since my son had an easy time using it that I would try a regular cup. Well today I gave him a toddler sized cup and the first time he started drinking from it with no issues. I am so excited that this Reflo Smart cup was a quick transition and the best part is that I can still use this cup with or without the insert so there is no money wasted here! Again, I am very pleased with this purchase!",5
3503,"This is the first and only carrier I have ever used so I can't compare it to others. I did like this carrier up until my baby was about 6-7 months old, at which point she hit 20 lbs and was just too heavy for this to provide proper support and wearing her began to hurt my back. But I do recommend it for babies who are light enough. After you learn all the different wraps (if you want to learn more than what is in the book check out Youtube; plenty of moms with lots of time on their hands have come up with mannnnny more wraps) it is quick and easy to get on.Some moms will say that in order to use this in public they put in on before they leave and wear it out, but I am not the kind of person who is going to walk out of the house wearing this. It was a struggle, but after you get the hang of it it is possible to put this on in the car or after you get out without it touching the ground.I live in Florida and this was hot enough for both baby and I inside of the house, but when we went outside in the heat it was unbearable. It probably didn't help that I have the black one, but I think it is the type of fabric as well. For those who say the fabric isn't stretchy enough, I found it to be very flexible but again I don't have anything else to compare it to.Once your baby is big enough to old their head up and move around it does feel a little less secure and I wouldn't really call it hands-free. If you are doing anything other than walking around upright (like shopping or taking a walk or something), the baby is in your way. If you bend over you have to support them with a hand, and if you're trying to use your hands like to do dishes or fold laundry it isn't exactly easy to do it with the baby hanging in front of you (especially when they're trying to grab everything in their reach, which is pretty much anything that is in your reach).As far as breastfeeding, I did get the hang of one of the wraps that you can breastfeed in but my baby really didn't like having her head inside of the fabric. It was both restrictive and hot for her, I think. But what you can do is take the baby out and just use the wrap as a cover. She never would let me put a blanket over my shoulder to conceal her eating, but she didn't seem to mind when I used the wrap to cover her partially.I would recommend this carrier to moms of smaller babies. It is comfortable and easy to use.",4
3504,"This is the perfect introductory product to the world of wrapping your baby. Perfect for newborns and older. I used mine until my son was about 3 months old and then I bought a woven wrap so I could do back carries. Babies of all ages LOVE being worn, and the moby is perfect for moms who need free hands but don't want to put their baby down.",5

3506,"These are perfect for baby and toddler size clothes.The material does hold the clothes up better and prevents it from sliding down.The only downfall that I found is that some of the hangers were stuck together, and when I went to take them apart they tore the fabric.I still can use them so they are not a total loss.",4
3507,"This was great and my daughter loved it.  Fisher-Price quality as usual!  Not sure if this one was available at Toys R Us at the time I ordered this one but I read reviews on many.  Chose this one and was not disappointed.",5
3508,"I love this car seat pouch.  It has pockets on both sides.  It will work on the left or the right of the seat and it tucks under the frame just a little so that it doesn't protrude into other passengers.  Also, our carrier is currently rear facing and we have no trouble with it getting in the way.  It is small with little pouches but that's just fine for us.  I'm not looking to store stuffed animals in it. It is perfect for pacifiers, small bottles and cups, squeeze pouches and the like.  It's in a position that is a bit difficult for the child to reach but I think that is a good thing.  This way I can store several things for a sibling to hand to baby without baby pulling everything out and throwing stuff all over the car!",5
3509,"I love this seat protector.  It has been tested for safety and will save my leather seats from getting permanent cracks.",5
3510,"Love these bags. I use the snack size more often for my 4.5 year old for now, though. They are so easy to use and very easy to launder. We had this brand of bibs and laundered them daily with no issues. I'm expecting the same from these bags. Great quality.",5
3511,"Easy to use, easy to launder. I LOVE these!",5
3512,"These stacking cups are advertised as a bath toy, and indeed they are a great success in the tub.  However for my little one they have become a universal hit.  Banging them together, against the tile bathroom floor or the carpet seems to produce never-ending satisfaction.  Colorful, clever, well-made, tough & durable -- these are a big hit.  My 9 month old loves them -- they're his favorite toy.",5
3513,"This snack keeper is very cute, but not very user friendly, for the child or the adult.  The hole is just a bit too small for my son to get his hand and the snacks out of easily, and he's only 19 months old.  He gets frustrated trying to fight the monster for his cheerios... On top of that, it is really difficult to open for cleaning or filling.  I feel like it is going to break every time, and if I don't empty it first, snacks go everywhere.  I got the simpler designed snack cups with the round lid, and they are working much better for both of us!",3
3514,"Playful container but it fall short in the way the lid attaches to the bottom piece. It just loosely snaps on. It is not a twist closure thus if your child drops this item, top and bottom pieces will separate! I have to put two pieces of tape on so that the lid won't pop off when dropped.",2
3515,"The good news is that your child will probably not spill the snacks enclosed in this case. The bad news is that you will not use this container because your child also won't be able to get any snacks out of it. I bought a cheaper one that is easier to access that we use. My son can't have it unmonitored because he will shake it and get snacks all over the place.",3
3516,"Bought this to help slow down the eating monster that is my son. I'm not sure why kids feel it's necessary to fit ALL THE THINGS in their mouth at one time, but I wanted a snack container that would prevent him from getting fistfuls of whatever at a time. The other reviewers noted that the plastic teeth were very strong/stiff, so it takes little hands a while to get to the snack, and provides resistance so they only get a few pieces each time. We've had this for several months now and it's held up really well - being thrown mid-tantrum, stepped on by my husband and me, packed into bags, etc. True to the reviews, the teeth are still very rigid but for the most part my son takes this as a challenge to get to the snacks. The top (purple) clicks into the bottom (green) very tightly - so tightly that you definitely need to empty it of snacks or you'll scatter them everywhere when you finally pop the top off, but a quick rinse is all it needs. Bonus - the dog can't get his nose in to steal any snacks (although I did catch him trying to stick his tongue in through the teeth, but I guess that didn't feel very good).",5

3524,"This is definitely worth the price! All the other diaper pails on the market require you to use THEIR pricey bags. With this diaper pail, you can use any bag you please. We have had no issues with any smell escaping, so it does its job.Another plus, other diaper pails are just so ugly looking, you almost dread having to buy one. Ubbi diaper pails has any color you desire to match babys nursery. We actually had a hard time choosing which color. Lol.",5
3525,"My daughter hats when the water runs down her face as I was her hair. This product stops that from happening. I purchased it when she was a little over two. She is almost three now and there is still room for growth. It makes washing her hair a less torturous process.The quality is great. I am sure I can pass it down to someone once she now longer fits it.It is a great investment.",5
3526,"I've had my navigator for 2 months now for my 4 year old and 8 month old. Today for the first time I placed the Chicco car seat in the stroller I was surprised how well it fit and how sturdy it was..i never tried it out because I knew about the adapters. Well you don't need any adapter for the Chicco carseat as long as the seat is up using the zippers on both sides, buckles need to be undone on the back of the stroller and the front foam bar has to be on too. That's where the car seat will sit on. I am big on safety and it feels totally safe to me. I'm so happy with the stroller and how easy it is to fold and unfold..it was such a pain to fold/ unfold at first but I'm getting the hang of it..it rides so smooth..note: if you buy one new make sure you or hubby puts air in the tires makes it feel like you're riding on a cloud..super smooth.",5
3527,"These are so cute, they glow in the dark and work so well. Easy to clean and spot when you are desperate to find!",5
3528,"Once our son became mobile, it seemed like I suddenly saw 1000 sharp corners in our living room.  These are easy to apply and do the job.  Haven't tried to take them off anything yet, but I'm much less worried about tape residue than my son's well-being!",5
3529,"I bought our Roundabout 55 as an extra carseat, but we have ended up using it quite often. We have had it for about a year now. Our &#34;main&#34; carseat is a Britax Boulevard, but I actually like the Roundabout a little more. The latch is very easy to use and install the seat correctly. My 27 pound 19 month old still comfortably rides rear facing. She is big/tall for her age but still has a decent amount of growing room height wise in the seat. The seat is roomy and comes with a supportive back pillow/cushion for smaller children. From an installation point of view, the Boulevard and the Roundabout are identical in overall size and installed the same way. However, the Roundabout is not as heavy, and it has no headwings, which makes it easier to get the child in/out of the seat but offers less head protection. There are also other fairly minor differences, such as some harness features.I have installed the seat with a good, proper fit in a 2004 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition, a 2004 Ford F-150, a 2014 Ford Escape, a 2004 Hyundai Tiburon, a 2006 Kia Rio, a 2006 Scion TC, and a Chevy Aveo.The print (Silverlake) is cute and gender-neutral. The cover, crotch buckle pad and harness shoulder covers are washable. The seat sits up on a smaller, contoured base with anti-slip grip, which makes it great for smaller cars and for airplane seats, since it sits above the armrests. One thing I don't really like about the seat is the short shell height, as it's outgrown at 36 inches. My Boulevard will be outgrown at 39 inches, as most other convertible seats are, although some go higher. Also, the harness can be difficult to loosen/tighten when getting the child in/out, and it is also must be rethreaded as the child grows. But, for the $100 I paid, the height issue with the Roundabout is not a big deal to me. By the time my first child outgrows it, it will be passed down to the next child and used until it expires.",4
3530,"My daughter really seems to like this car seat. She had grown out of her infant seat. So when we got this one I could see that she was much more comfortable. It's very easy to install. My only comment if you're installing it rear facing is that you might want to put something under the bottom of it to prop it up and make it lean back more. I had it reclined all the way and it still seemed to make her sit up a little far. But now I have her forward facing and it's perfect.",5
3531,"As I mentioned in the review of the Infant Optics monitor - these cords are the most cheaply made part of the system.  I have had to repair (re-wire) or replace (buying this product) multiples of this cord over a 2 year duration.I would recommend finding an alternative from a different manufacturer if you need a replacement to the original power adapters from the monitor kit.",1
3532,"I really love the Halo products, they are usually high quality and I feel my daughter is safe and sound using them. I love the extra long length of these sacks that leave room for stretching and kicking - my baby girl is training for River Dance so she needs the leg room. Also the cotton is very smooth and soft and high quality. Very pretty bubble gum pink and baby looks adorable sleeping in her crib in it.And, I think she just feels good in it! The night it arrived, we washed and used it immediately. She had been flailing around in her crib a bit (we stopped swaddling just a week ago) ,I put this thing on her and she laid perfectly still, head flat on the crib mattress, arms resting comfortably over her head lol. No stirring. She doesn't usually look quite that comfy while sleeping.However, it has a really cheap zipper metal zipper that is difficult to zip.  I fear that it will break, and it's not coated in matching paint to make it a little softer, its just a hard silver metal zipper, and the catch is right under her chin :-(  I have used other Halo sleep sacks that had the nice painted zippers that were very smooth and worked great. Not sure why they chose this zipper for this model.In terms of sizing, my baby has the size small and she is about 13 lb. She fits in it well but definitely has room to grow. I would expect this to fit her for at least several months. Most of these sacks go for around twenty dollars unless you catch a sale, so this was a good deal at around sixteen dollars.",3
3533,"I hated to fork out the money for these, and tried some other hacks (like carseat strap covers - that failed).  However, with all Boba products, the quality was fantastic.  And SOOOO soft.  Everything is made with quality and comfort in mind.  I bought them because my little chomper is about to teethe/chew through the straps in the Boba, and I wanted it to last at least another year.  With these, I'm sure it will!",5
3534,"So soft and keeps my carrier clean! My daughter loves it and so do it! So glad I bought it.",4
3535,"Love having a glass alternative.  I tried these instead of Lifefactory because I'd heard they're better for breastfed babies (don't know if that is true, but my breastfed baby has had no trouble going back and forth from these).  I did buy the Olababy sleeves to protect these bottles which makes the total cost quite high. Can't imagine why Avent doesn't include silicone sleeves to begin with.  Also the packaging doesn't say if you can wash the nipple in the dishwasher .",3
3536,"I wish I had started with this instead of Dr. Brown's and Tommee Tippee! Dr. Brown's was just too hard to clean. And Tommee Tippee was plastic. This is so easy and easy to clean! I feel so much better about baby drinking from glass instead of plastic.We use 2 nipple for a breast fed baby and he's 8 months",5
3537,"my little one doesnt really like the feel of it once he got used to the feel of the hard plastic and i have found that i seldom use it without a potty underneath it.",4
3538,"I love that the Potette has optional reusable liners. I had a problem with throwing away liners after each potty session, but these just drop in and can be left in while you rinse the potty out!  They are sturdy enough that I am not worried about them giving out any time soon.",5
3539,"This Potette has been a lifesaver so many times.Car trips? Check.Park where only a port a potty of a dubious nature is available? CheckTrail run around a lake with a 4 year old that will not under any circumstances use a tree? Check.Hiking? Check.If you have potty training kiddos (especially girls) this will get used. Sadly, my kids at one point had peed in the hatchback using this Potette so many times, they referred to it as the &#34;car potty&#34;. We've never had a mess, it folds up in a snap, and the bags can get tossed like a diaper.",5
3540,"Love it! Our daughter started stepping fine unswaddled at around 6 weeks which is when we. Stopped using her newborn size halo sleepsac. She started moving around more in her sleep not too long after and her moving woke her up so we were relieved to see her sleepsac available in this size. Kept her warm but not too warm and sound asleep.",5
3541,"The baby bath towels were getting to be too small for my almost two year old toddler.  I ordered this one and could not be happier.  It is really cute and so easy to wrap her up after a bath.  She likes the owl and will point to his &#34;beak&#34;.  The towel washes up well, and so far is soft.",5
3542,"I bought two of these to organize my baby's closet, and they're fantastic! All of his sheets, towels, washcloths, and several of his blankets, books, stuffed animals, feeding supplies, bibs, and so on all fit in these. The ONLY down side is that they are too long to allow a second closet rod halfway down for more hanging room. But these provide so much storage space (and look cute too), that it's not a big deal. Babies R Us and Target also have these (a dumb-ed down version) for more expensive. Buy them here instead!",5
3543,"I love the wrap around attachment at the top. I use this for my 7 month old's blankets and clothes. I put small wicker baskets in the bottom shelves to keep the smaller items from falling out and it still stays up. I bought another one for my older son's Shoes, socks and underwear.",5
3544,"I like how soft and cuddly this monkey is.  I hope my son will appreciate it when he's old enough to start playing with toys.",5
3545,"bought this to go with all of our other Bedtime Originals Curly Tail items for the nursery. good quality. good price. really soft and cute. arrived on time and in good condition.",5
3546,"I used these to exclusively breast pump milk for 8 months. It helped me increase supply because they were more comfortable than the ones provided with the pump. I flipped them up and down 1/2 way through pumping session. I will be forever grateful for this product because it helped me provide milk to a child that wouldn't nurse.",5
3547,"These are amazing! I had soreness because of the rigidness of the Medela flanges, but Pumpin' Pal shields erased any pain while pumping. It's hard to tell in the picture, but basically these are like a funnel with no hard edges, unlike the flanges that come with every breast pump available. My only complaint is that you have to have the two piece kind of flange, or an extra large one-piece flange so these can fit into it. I used a Medela pump for 2 months to make sure that I wanted to invest in a pump, and now use a Spectra. This does not work with a Spectra pump...but I'm not going to take away any stars because of my personal pump preference!",5
3548,"I don't think these are any more comfortable or efficient than the Medela flanges.  In fact, I think they're more awkward.  I still can't sit comfortably while pumping and because of the angled shape of the flange, it doesn't hold to my breast like the Medela flanges.  Also, I'm annoyed that it only comes with in packs of 3 sizes because I only use one size (making the other two sets useless and a waste of money).  Stick to the Medela flanges.",2
3549,"It took me a little while to learn how to quickly unfold and fold this stroller because the locking mechanism didn't seem to release properly.  It does work as expected---pushes nicely, has the storage, etc.  The harness is still a little loose for my six-month old granddaughter but she still is able to stay in the stroller.  When the stroller is folded, it feels to me that it will come unfolded while carrying it.  It hasn't come unfolded but it's not a tight fold.",5
3550,"These are easy to use and don't have any weird filters that come loose when &#34;someone&#34; throws them on the floor. My son likes to hold them, it's a good price for the number of cups you get, it fits in the cup holder of all his strollers and it's easy for him to handle. Without the &#34;filter&#34; it is a little easier to spill but my son can spill liquids out of anything, so that doesn't really cost this product any points.",5
3551,"The middle of the flexible rim bends in a way that sends water into babies ears. Keeps lots of water out of her eyes, but some still gets in from the sides.",3
3552,"I mostly use this to put hummus and chips in for my daughter's lunch. Or sometimes I use it to put pasta or a rice dish in the bottom part while still using the middle part to hold it together tightly. The lid really stays on well without the use of those stupid rubber seals which always fall off or break with other lunch boxes. I wash it in the dishwasher and it cleans up well. I wish this wasn't as expensive, I'd buy more!",5
3553,"I'm glad that I got such a large mat for a great price, however it was almost too big for our living room.  Didn't want to damage it by putting toys on it and risk getting indentations so we had to move things out of the living room to put it down.  My baby is just now turning 6 months and wasn't quite into as much as I think she will be when she's older.  I purchased it so that she would have a nice padded surface while learning how to crawl.",4
3554,"It's very cute, provides good cushion and my 2 year old loves it. But it is not durable. It is made of foam and we already have many tears in it after only 6 months of use. If it's meant to drive their little cars on, with hard wheels it should have been made of a tear proof material.",2
3555,"Great fit for little one's hand and our grandson is fascinated with it's eyes. Bright colors keeps his attention too, the sound isn't as annoying as some rattles are, so I am pleased.",5
3556,"My 3 month old loved this mirror. It was a big help in getting her more interested in tummy time and rolling. Babies are such narcissists.",4
3557,"There's a lot to like about this walker and it's written in the description and other reviews.  The best things I like about the walker is that it has a clean look to it.  I have not used it for feeding my granddaughter but it looks like it will be easy to clean after doing so.  The walked does fold---rather compactly for a walker, but I haven't found it to lock shut and I have pinched my fingers while carrying it to put it away.  I'm able to change all the toys on the walker for her so she doesn't get bored with looking at the same things.",5
3558,"unlike most walkers, which are ridden with all the baby &#34;bells and whistles&#34; and silly patterns, my husband and i selfishly appreciate that this walker is not a complete eyesore! the tray is huge, and although our baby isn't feeding herself yet (7months), there is plenty of room for her favorite rattles/teethers, and i think the large surface area of the tray helps prevent things from *immediately* ending up on the floor (takes more like a minute!) :) our daughter LOVES cruising around in this and it has been really fun watching her learn how to use her legs to navigate around the house!downsides:- wheels: lately, the front wheels have gotten a pretty stopped up. i removed them, cleaned them and put a little WD40 on the pin that they rotate on. we'll see if this helps a little. i wish they were made of rubber instead of plastic.- setup: *slightly* difficult at first getting the seat into the housing. requires a little elbow grease and some manual dexterity!overall though, a great purchase.",4
3559,"This is the biggest walker I have ever seen.  I do love it though and I'm thankful that we have the room for it.  I love that I am able to vary the toys that my son plays with because there is nothing attached to the tray.  I just pick a few of his toys out and place them on the tray.  This is a good quality walker.",5
3560,"Love it so much. It's comfortable for me and I think for my baby too. Very stylish I love that I doesn't look like I'm carrying by baby in a backpack. Personal preference I guess. I little pricy but I do think it's made well",5
3561,"order one size up than what you need to order.  they fit on the small side. very waterproof though. does exactly what it says",4
3562,"it's so cute! I use it as a carseat cover when we got out or as a blanket and have gotten several compliments on it. I just wished it was softer like the muslin blankets because it is kind of stiff-ish material. but overall cute design.",4
3563,"I bought these for my 4 year old daughter.  Now she has been potty trained since she was 3 BUT she has some health issues where she is on medication for seizures.  If we up her dose she tends to wet her bed for a few nights in a row.  I bought these for this occasion.  Also my son is two and we will be potty training him soon and he is a big boy so these actually fit.  Win win!They work prefect, keep the liquid off the sheets and pull up like underwear.",5
3564,"These have been wonderful for overnight security on my 2 year old. She typically stays dry, but occasionally has a small accident/doesn't wake up in time to make it to the potty. She likes the prints on her &#34;special night night panties,&#34; too. My one complaint is that the sizing runs small. My toddler typically wears 18 month-2T pants (a lot of 2T pants are too big), but the medium trainers are really snug on her. FYI: These do not contain an entire pee. If you're dealing with a potty learner who often &#34;just goes&#34; in his/her pants, these probably won't work well.",4
3565,"they are exactly what they say they are. only thing I don't like is the feel of them.  but that's prob just me.  feels like the rags that soak  lot of water in for when you wash your car.",5
3566,"I love this pump! The parts are clear so you can see exactly what you're doing, the massager is great and soft and comfortable, it is effective at getting lots of milk out quickly, and the parts are easy to clean.  It comes with 2 cheap bottles but it screws onto any standard size bottle.If you're not going to be pumping for work / constantly, this is great to keep by the bedside to quietly relieve engorgement without waking the baby!",5
3567,"I compared several manual breast pumps before deciding on this one. Unfortunately, it didn't even work once for me. There was virtually no suction at all. I'm guessing it has something to do with the small tear in the valve I found after soaking it prior to the first use. Anyhow, it's gone in bin, and I'm trying the Lasinoh next. Hopefully, I'll have better luck with that.",1
3568,"Hands down, this co-sleeper bed was the best investment we made when our daughter was born. Our daughter came home after three months in the NICU, so she was tiny for a long time, and this co-sleeper gave us peace of mind, ease in moving her around, a clear view of her, and a separate sleeping space from our bed. I would recommend this co-sleeper to any preemie parent or parents with babies who have apnea, and I would imagine it would work well for twins. We were able to clip our daughter's mobile on to it and it played a big part in us crib training her when she was ready. We would sleep with the co-sleeper at the foot of our bed, as we were both in and out of bed all night long to warm up bottles for our little one. We did not need to take the side down often, but it isn't hard to do. The side pockets are a great feature too. We stored extra pacifiers and blankets there.I love that the co-sleeper is on wheels, so you can move your sleeping baby from room to room. There is a lot of storage beneath the bed, so you can store everything you need for middle-of-the-night diaper changes close to the baby. Our daughter was able to stay in the co-sleeper until she was six months old since it took her a while to push up on her hands and knees. The sheet that the co-sleeper came with was the main one we used, and it holds us well through many washes. Our sheet was pooped and puked on a lot and you cannot even tell. Next time, I will buy at least one more sheet.",5
3569,"My kid loves this thing in the bath!",5
3570,"I brushed off the complaints that this cup leaked. It does. Not through the seals, but up through the straw. This cup leaves a ring of milk wherever you put it down. And a light suck on the straw can bring a rush of liquid into your mouth. The extra cost for a weighted straw is just not worth this mess.",2
3571,"These cups are wonderful.  The straw is connected to a round ball that stays at the bottom of the cup. making it easy to get every drop.  The top slides to hide the straw when not in use or out and about.",5
3572,"It's comfortable and works well. I really appreciate the one-handed tray removal. I wish it were a little easier to adjust it, but that's the tradeoff for the space savings, so it's worth it to me. I'd buy again.",4
3573,"I wasn't sure about this to begin with, but my daughter loves it so far. I like that the seat can transition to an adapter when she moves on to the big potty. She loves the music and that she can &#34;flush&#34; it. I also like that the size and weight give it more stability than many of the potty seats out there. (We bought the frog potty for a vacation and she refused to use it.)",5
3574,"I bought this along with a full arsenal of potty-training supplies for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it, but treats it more like a toy than a potty. She will sit on it, and flush it, but thats it. She has never used it for its intended purpose. We put it away and decided to give her some more time before trying the potty again. Flash forward a month later, same result. She likes the training pants and wipes, and is very good about telling us when she needs to go or has gone. This potty just isn't for her, so I only gave 3 stars. I'm sure for some kids its a great tool, and I had high hopes. But, I guess my girl is more simple than I expected when it comes to potty training. I have another child and will hold on to it...maybe my son will have more of an interest in it. It is adorable though.",3
3575,"Got my daughter to use it once...it freaked her out because she didn't know what was going on...that and my wife freaked her out just as she was trying out the potty, flushed, and got a praise from the &#34;toy-let&#34; and my wife. My daughter comes back to it to play on it, but I haven't been able to get her bare bum on it since. We'll try again here in another couple weeks.Overall, this is a good potty practice pot. My daughter does sit on it, even when she is not going potty. I can't wait until she does it constently...good pot, get it.",4
3576,"I received this as a gift at my baby shower.  I received three tubs, and decided to return the other two.The first time we bathed baby, this tub seemed massive.  We laid a towel down first to help combat the newborn &#34;slipperyness&#34;, and that's how we bathed baby for the first month or so.  I love that the duck's little feet keep the wash clothes and soap close.  One is slotted so that excess water grains away - the other is not.  I also love that this fits perfectly over our kitchen sink.  That helped so much when baby was smaller, so that I didn't have to break my back bending over the bath tub and try to hold on to a wiggly, slippery newborn at the same time.At almost 4 months now, we've moved on to placing this baby tub inside of our big tub.  Baby loves water, and lots of it!  This holds him, no problem.  He wiggles and splashes and this tub keeps him from slipping down under the water.The plug assists in easily draining this tub.  I then place it upside down in the big tub and it is dry within minutes.This is a great product!!  Would buy again or as a gift.",5

The inside of the strap which wraps around the actual cup is a rubber, so it can't slip off of the sippy cup. the strap itself is adjustable and can be made extra long to not interfere with sipping. I am able to hook the end of this sippy cup strap to my son's stroller, car seat, shorten the length to fit his wrist or his backpack.. it fits all sized cups. it is AWESOME.",5
3581,"My daughter uses this baby monitor a lot for her baby when he is in the crib and she is outside. The sound quality is good, and the monitor is lightweight and easy to carry. You can hear the baby starting to get fussy before he starts crying, which is good. It sure beats having to come back inside frequently to check on the baby!",5
3582,"Worst bottle ever!!! Will leak all over the place! My daughter is EBF & this bottle makes it hard when you're trying to transition from breast to bottle because of the excessive leaking! Not to mention it takes time to pump & makes me upset to lose out on good breast milk!",1
3583,"I purchased this bib because my daughter had received one as a baby gift at her shower and I loved it.  I still like it but I also purchased a different brand of the same type of bib.  Those bibs were cheaper and I actually liked them better.  They seemed to be slightly more waterproof and I liked the material better.",5
3584,"I have several of these, as my baby is a &#34;happy spitter&#34; with frequent spit up episodes. We go through 6-10 bibs a day.  We own the first generation of these, where the Velcro was abrasive,they stayed on better but left friction marks on my babies neck,then we bought these, the second generation and the Velcro is much softer but stops sticking /working after a few washes, now I can't keep the bibs on her during the feeds, she's just tugs them off at 5 months.Bottom line, I would buys dozens of these if they snapped. The thick rim around neck is super helpful in keeping sneaky spit up off the clothes, but with the Velcro issues, they are worthless. I will be buy the Aden and anis snap bibs instead going forward.",1
3585,"Perfect for catching breastmilk dribbles or any milk for that matter!  Totally worth it! I wish it came in a bulk package.",5
3586,"This carrier distributes the weight evenly and makes carrying baby outdoors convenient.  This is not however something you will toss on to allow you to do things around the house. It takes 2 people to get it adjusted and the baby in it.",4
3587,"I first tried the baby Bjorn that I got fo a shower gift.  I didn't like that so I got the ergo. I loved it. It was so much easier on my back and my baby was more comfortable too. Very easy to use.",5
3588,"This tub does its job wonderfully and is well made.  Baby likes it and it is great fro sink or tub washes! Recommend to any new parent in need of washing assistance for their little ones!",5
3589,"I like the size of this mirror and the convex curve allows me to see my son easily. It installed easily in my Honda Fit.  However, it vibrates when I am driving and vibrations eventually move the mirror out of position. I have tried adjusting it multiple ways and even stuffing burp rags behind it but nothing keeps it in place. I need to reposition it every other car trip.",3
3590,"This takes a little patients as you try to adjust it in place, but it straps on quickly and holds firmly.",5
3591,"I bought this mirror after reading review after review of the various mirrors here on Amazon. This mirror is large and durable so it doesn't get contorted. I have this mirror in my car and my husbands. Both aimed at baby so I can see this mirror in my rear view mirror at a glance and see my baby is okay. You wouldn't think you need to keep checking on a baby when driving but I have heard stories of kids vomiting in their car seat or putting some odd small object in their mouth and the parents not realizing until it's too late. I understand the odds of that happening are super slim but this mirror gives me the piece of mind I needed while commuting wherever with baby.Two problems you might encounter -- first it is technically unsafe to put anything near your child's carseat. In the event of a serious accident the carseat essentially creates a closing clam shell to protect your child. If a mirror is directly in front of your child it could cause injury. Consider instead placing the mirror as far to the side as possible and then angling it down to face your child. Second you really need a headrest to attach this to. Some seat designs have weird headrests and this might not attach so be prepared for 20 minutes of adjust/squishing/tightening to get this mirror to safely secure to your headrest (if it fits).",5
3592,"While this mirror has the nicest viewing shape and size, it is too wobbly because of the mount.  The distorted image from the amplified car vibrations gave me a headache.  I wanted to see if others noticed the same problem, and sure enough this is a common complaint for this Britax mirror.The Britax mirror and the BRICA mirror (old + new model BRICA) each have around 500 reviews:-- When I searched the Britax reviews for the keywords &#34;shake&#34; or &#34;vibrate&#34; there were 17 results complaining about the shaking.-- When I searched the BRICA mirrors for the same, I got zero results; so far no one complains about the vibrations for BRICA.I ended up changing this for the BRICA mirror.  Sure enough the BRICA does not shake and gives a clear image while driving because it hugs snugly up against the headrest.  Even though the BRICA mirror is smaller and doesn't have the optical quality of the Britax, I prefer the worse form factor of the BRICA over the annoying vibration distortions.",2
3593,"Great large mirror. Easy to install. I can see babe good with it on my center headrest as long as the car seat handle is released and it's shade is completely down.",5
3594,"I had a mirror before that was half the cost, and none of the value.  It slid around and I could never see the baby.  This one is designed exactly how it should be if you or I were to do it.  There are two straps to keep it tightly in place, and it rotates on a snug ball bearing-type mount to position the mirror.  It's perfect.  I have been driving around with it - and bumping it when I put the infant car seat in and out of the car - and it hasn't required adjusting.  Should have spent the money the first time.  Worth it.",5
3595,"Great mirror. Does seem to move a bit while driving though so I do have to re-adjust it every so often, which is my only complaint.",5
3596,"This is a great mirror--great field of vision, great size, great clarity.  However, it does not stay put!  It's not the pivot point that is the problem, it's the actual straps that make this a constant-adjustment mirror.  If it had a large elastic strap with velcro closure, it would be far superior in terms of stability.  But as it is, there are two straps--one horizontal, and one vertical, both with adjustments at the buckles.  The straps move every which way, especially on bumpy roads or if the mirror is knocked a little bit when taking the carseat in or out.  I suppose this can be remedied by a little duct tape, as another reviewer suggested, or you can do what I do and adjust this thing daily.",3
3597,"Mirror adjusts to be able to see car seat placed in center position, but baby can only be seen in the corner of the mirror because mirror won't turn any more. Worked in 2012 CR-V, but may not work as well if car headrest can't raise to thread straps underneath.",3
3598,"I love it, the size, the quality, the price, everything, its original from britax. really love it, thanks for all",5
3599,"Easily installable and adjustable also. The reflection is clear enough that you can see it and not warped like some back seat infant mirrors that I have had. The profile is a little higher though.",5
3600,"This is the biggest mirror.  You can have it vertical or horizontal.  We only purchased one, and it fits well in our SUV.  I'm not sure it would work well in our car which has the headrest combined with the seat.  The SUV has the headrest that can move up and down, so the strapping mechanism on this mirror works very well.",5
3601,"tried all different types.. music no music lighted etc... This one is big and mirror is very clear.  At night had small flashlight to check baby when stopped at signal if on my own.  Baby can see you clearly as well!",5
3602,"I look at this and stand there like a kid reflecting as a midget, and I don;t like it.  Now, when I move to the right it reflects me as a guy with a stubby body and a large head like the ConeHeads from SNL.  My baby girl looks into it and gets big eyes like she cannot comprehend what her parents have done to her.  I seriously get a headache from looking into this thing and do NOT recommend you saving a few bucks by buying it.  Spend 5-10 bucks more and get a good one.  The size of this one is good, but what good is that when your kid is leaving the car like they just did dope?I am getting another one, and using this one for Halloween front door fun.",2
3603,"Works fine for us to view our daughter in her Graco Snugride 35. We have this fitted in our LandRover LR2. The mirror stays in place and doesn't vibrate. Maybe it is just us, however I found it odd that the Britax logo on the mirror needed to be upside down, at first we had the mirror fitted the wrong way thinking that the Britax logo should be the right way up.",4
3604,"These patches were a true miracle. Breastfeeding can be rough, but these little patches can be very helpful during those first painful weeks after one starts breastfeeding. They can also be washed with cold water, which adds to the comfort. Highly recommend them.",5
3605,"It's so lightweight and easy for her to grab. It was the first thing she lifted to her mouth (other than cloth) as well as the first thing she held with both hands. She did each of these things the very first time we gave it to her at 12 weeks. I wish I would have ordered it sooner!",5
3606,"Bought for these for my son's Infant classroom/daycare to use as a Baby musical instruments. They are pretty simple, but have shaker in the middle and the soft cage/ball on the end. Perfect for little hands to grasp.",5
3607,"For just $3 plus free shipping as an add on item, this little rattle is well worth the price! Our 6week old can already hold and grip it and the balls on each end are a soft rubber material so little noggins are protected and mom has peace of mind.",5
3608,"I love the concept of this shaker, but my son doesn't seem to play with it... He loves his Oball products so I thought this would be a good fit but it is kind of cumbersome for him.  I still give it a 4 star because it is a well built product, I just don't think it is the one for my son, oh well, maybe he will use it more when he gets a little older.",4
3609,"Good quality.  Exactly how I expected it to be.  It is sturdy, versatile for different car seats, and easy to use.",5
3610,"I have now used this with two strollers: a carseat-adapter Baby Trends stroller, where the carseat has a fairly substantial shade, and a no-name umbrella stroller with a very tiny canopy. The Baby Trends stroller is rear-facing because it accommodates a car seat, so I had to finagle the arrangement of the velcro straps a bit, but I ended up fastening the base straps to the bar farthest from the person pushing the stroller. The other two straps I fastened to the tubes that attach the handle to the rest of the carseat. Because of the shape of the carseat, the sunshade was parallel to the ground in most situations. If the sun was directly behind me, all I had to do was hold the edge of the sunshade down with my fingertips, which I could easily do while pushing the stroller.In the umbrella stroller (baby forward-facing), I've found that it still has two &#34;modes.&#34; When the elastic of the base of the sunshade is pulled as far back as possible (flush with the handlebars), baby is mostly shaded, but she can see about 3 feet in front of her. If I'm walking into the sun, I can push the shade forward. The front of the shade will then tip down, which almost completely obscures her view, but also keeps her entirely out of the sun.The only con I can think of with this shade is that if your baby is completely shaded in some situations, his or her vision might also be mostly obscured. I can imagine that this would make some babies fussy. That being said, I have a baby who loves to just sit and stare at everything and even she doesn't mind the shade being down - maybe watching the road and mailbox posts go by is entertainment enough.",5
3611,"Great for our baby trend jogging stroller. We don't have to worry about our baby being covered. Sometimes the sun catches her toes but that's about it. She's 6 months so still a little small.",5
3612,"Got this as a baby shower gift for a friend, and she cannot stop raving about it!  Really pretty bag with embellishment in the front (I didn't know it on the picture).",5
3613,"Works well to contain toys and looks cute also! I will definitely order more of these in the future for my toddler.",4
3614,"I'm obsess with skip hop products!! I love this basket so I can keep my boy's toys in their place. Love the colors and the fact that it fits onto his Ikea book shelf perfectly",5
3615,"My daughter loves owls, so I thought she would love this little towel.  She's a small 2 year old, and it fits her fine for now, but she's going to outgrow it pretty soon.  It might be a little more suitable for a baby, although they probably wouldn't enjoy the hood or the design at that age.  Either way, it's pretty cute, and I would have only liked to have gotten it sooner for her so she could get more use out of it!",4
3616,"Not sure about assembly, my husband put it together on his own one evening and he didn't complain. Otherwise, I love it for feeding and rocking my son. The arms are cushioned which is great for those long feedings in the begging. My only complaint is that as a short person (5'2&#34;) I have to sit on a pillow to feel truly comfortable but that's no big deal. Cleans up well and looks great in our nursery.",5
3617,"If I could give it zero stars, I would!  It is poorly made and cheap...I guess you get what you pay for!  The wood and joints squeak no matter what and it's VERY annoying when rocking a baby!  What a waste of money--you will regret this if you purchase it!!",1
3618,"I bought these because I thought they were cute.  I never thought my daughter would love them as much as she does.  When we first started with them in the tub she would use them to splash around.  She gradually figured out how to take them off the walls when I would stick them up there.  Now she has figured out how to stick them up herself.  She loves playing with them in every bath.  She is currently teething and chews on them A LOT.  They have all held up to her abuses.",5
3619,"I like these toys because I don't have to throw them out if they do not store water and become black and molding inside these last much longer than it toys that can hold water accentually",5
3620,"ordered these bath toys for my son, he loves them..great to chew on if they are teething. And, we love that you can stick them to the bath wall. Super cute!",4
3621,"This is the second I bought. They each lasted around 6/8 months of daily use at school. After reading te reviews of other products I figured none is really good. This one at least is cheap.",3
3622,"In the 2 years since our daughter was born, we seem to buy one of these every few months. The projector function is poorly made and stops turning after about six months of nightly use. My husband disassembled one and found a pile of plastic shavings in the bottom. We sent it in for warranty service, but it cost $13 to ship and 5 weeks to get it back. So, we've given up, and just go buy a new one from Buy Buy Baby with a $5 off coupon when the time comes.Our daughter LOVES the ocean sounds and sleeps to that every night, and begs to be in our room until the cow is jumping over the moon on the projector. We'll keep buying it because we've made it her comfort item, but I wouldn't recommend it to others until Homedics improves the construction.",3
3623,"We love this machine. We use it all the time - naps (sound) and nighttime (both sound & projection). This little machine is one of our favorite things! :) It is nice and small (softball sized) so it doesn't take up much room and therefore can also travel. Ours goes with my daughter on overnights and has been on three out of state airplane trips. It's nice to take this little piece of home with us  and drown out the sounds of a new place. We've had it for a little over a year, and the motor just quit making the projector spin, but it has also taken a beating. I just ordered a new one, so it will stay at home and the old one will travel. :) I have a 2 month old and one that just turned two, and they both love it!!!",5
3624,"Works great.  I wouldn't mind a few more slides... but, I can't complain- it's been helping us put our daughter to bed for 7 months and she still loves it.",5
3625,"I have twin girls (currently 7.5 months), and I wash about 4 - 5oz Medela bottles, and 6 - 9oz bottles on a daily basis.These are my favorite bottle brushes to use, and I usually change the brush I'm using at least once a month. So a two-pack usually lasts me about 1.5-2 months.While these brushes have held up pretty well in the last few months, I was disappointed that the sponges attached to the brushes from the last pack that I opened started breaking apart after one use! It broke down pretty quickly, so I moved onto the second one in the pack within the same week. Unfortunately, the sponge on the second brush pretty much did the same thing. I'm hoping that it's just that pack, and that the next pack I open won't be the same. Because I've had such great luck with several of these brushes, I'm giving it 4 stars. If I find the same sponge issue with subsequent purchases of these brushes, then I'll likely come back and change my rating.Less one star because I don't use the nipple brush. I personally don't like using it because it's too stiff, and because I use these brushes so frequently, I really don't like the idea of a brush sitting inside something -- I prefer to have my brushes air out while they dry. I actually have a separate nipple brush that I buy and use.",4
3626,"The only reason that I gave this four stars is because three of the buttons can be activated by push. The yellow is supposed to be a turn to open, but if it's at the right spot, you can just push on the yellow button and it will pop up. Someone had reviewed this and cautioned parents about their child getting hurt. I read the review and wondered how that could possibly happen, it sounds impossible? When when I got the item I started feeling around inside and realised what must have happened.While the pop-up is opening there is a space between the bottom of the animal and the white area of the toy on the top. If you feel around in there, there are a couple of sharp corners (that serve what purpose I couldn't tell you). So, if a kid opened this toy, then started to depress the animal to close it and got their finger inside on accident, but then didn't close it all the way, their finger could get stuck in between the bottom of the animal and the white part of the toy as it popped back up again, and as it's sharp, yeah it's definitely possible for an injury to occur.Overall, it's a great toy, just keep in mind that younger babies probably need to be supervised while using this.",4
3627,"baby loves the toy, however the sound can be better.  it is a bit on the annoying side for baby's toys and also quite loud.  however, the baby does like to play with it. it would be better if you could change the position of the toy easier than taking apart all the legs and reassembling it together",4
3628,"Looks great. Bought it because the color matches perfectly with our couch. My daughter loves it. It's also easy to clean which is a huge plus.",5
3629,"Daughter didn't like these because they are too firm.  They are different than the bright turquoise ones we got when in the hospital when she was born.  So now we have 6 pacifiers that are laying around the house, gathering dust.  We just threw them in the freezer for her to bite on when she starts teething.  We'll see if that works.  Waste of money if you're not sure if your baby will take them.  Maybe buy these in the store first before committing to a pack of 6.",3
3630,"I can't even express how much I love this product.  I have a skinny kid and this is just perfect to attach to all his shorts and stays put all day long.  Even my daycare provider is in love with it.",5
3631,"Good quality, my baby has enjoyed his milk with the Medela bottle until he has to move to the bigger size. Now we use it for water.",5
3632,"Works great, exactly the same as the expensive Medela one.  I've had not problems with it, I'm glad this option is out there!",5
3633,"Great paci clip, we have another one of a different design that has a bigger clip and I hate it. This clip is great, clip is small and secure.",5
3634,"My almost two year old daughter is 27 pounds.  I am 5' - 5&#34; and petite build.  The carrier was easy to put on and I was able to place my daughter in the back carrier position with little difficulty.  However, the carrier was not very comfortable for me or for her.  She kept saying - &#34;it is tight&#34; and crying.  I only kept it on for about ten minutes, and it was tolerable.  As others have mentioned, it does dig into your shoulders with a heavier child.  I think this would be a great carrier for a lighter weight child, and wish that it had worked out for us.",3
3635,"I like how compact this carrier is. My 14 month old is 22 pounds. When I need to run a quick errand with her, I'd rather use the Boba Air than the stroller. It's easy to put on, but it IS thin, so there isn't much support. I also hate that it kinda cuts into my baby's chunky thighs. Ive tried MANY carriers and this is the one I chose to stick with when my baby turned 10 months old.",4
3636,"returned it and decided to spend a little more to get the britax stroller organizer. The material is cheap and it's so flimsy! does not have the support to stay open so it's stays squished flat even with phone and keys.",1
3637,"I use this with my smaller stroller and it's great.  fits all the stuff I need when going on quick walks to CVS or a long afternoon stroll.",4
3638,"These bibs are perfect for the diaper bag and for trips to grandma's house.  I love that they come 4 bibs to a package, it just makes it more handy to keep them in the diaper bag that way.",4
3639,"Lightweight and sturdy, and it's great not having to take baby in and out of car seat, especially if she's sleeping. Use for walks and errands alike. Fits in trunk of car with room to spare.",5
3640,"I think my mom was joking when she said she would leave the stroller assembly to me because it looked complicated.  There are NO TOOLS REQUIRED!  Every part just snaps on (or off) easily.  I'm a big guy, but I can easily lift this and set it up with one arm.  The click-lock systems on these carseat bases have also come a long way.",5
3641,"If you have a baby, you have a playpen. These sheets are nice, wash easy, don't shrink and don't make the baby super hot when napping.",4
3642,"This worked great for the Graco Pack 'n Play pad by itself. We use it with our Dream On Me 3"" Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress on top of the Pack 'n Play mattress. It's a tight fit with that much depth but it works well and hasn't come off of the mattress yet. They are a little thin, but with the waterproof mattress underneath we are fine. It provides a nice little soft thermal barrier between our baby and the mattress.",5
3643,"This is a real barebones sheet. It fits the mattress, of course. All baby sheets do. Its pretty thin. Probably a low thread count. Its a basic sheet, no frills.",3
3644,"Best invention EVER! I love this thing & my 3 month old never goes to sleep without it! We've had one false alarm on the first night using it & that was because I didn't fold diaper so it was on him kind of loose. I can sleep so much better knowing if something were to happen (God forbid) this thing will go off & wake me up. It does leave a red mark on his belly but it's not bad. The alarm is loud but if baby is in another room u may not hear it but it's loud enough you'll hear it if baby sleeps in the same room as u.",5
3645,"After seeing this was the #1 top rated baby monitor on Amazon I wanted to give this a try, especially after reading all the customer reviews about how the Snuza saved so many babies lives. We haven't had any emergencies where our baby stopped breathing, but just knowing that we'll be alerted if he does gives us so much peace of mind, and better sleep!The peace of mind alone makes this device worth it - my friends with babies who don't have one tell me they wake up multiple times a night checking to make sure their baby is breathing. I haven't done that once because I know the Snuza will alert me if anything happens. It was especially great to have those first nights our baby slept in his own room in his crib. The video monitor is great to have, but you still can't see the baby breathing on it. That can be nerve wracking so knowing we have the extra protection is priceless. Our baby is 4 months old now and we still use it every night and he doesn't seem to mind it at all. He is just starting to roll over when he's awake, so I know it will only be a matter of time when he starts to do so when he's sleeping. Since SIDS is a much higher risk when babies are sleeping on their stomachs, I think we will sleep a lot more soundly knowing that he's wearing the Snuza.We tested the Snuza ourselves to see how it worked - their is a light that blinks green every time your baby breathes. It blinks orange if it's a weaker breath. And if your baby stops breathing, it vibrates to stir your baby. If your baby doesn't stir and start breathing again, the monitor alarms. You would be able to hear it through your normal baby monitor (video or just sound) easily.I definitely recommend this! Would also make a great shower gift and be something any new parents would appreciate, especially if they aren't aware such a great product exists.",5
3646,"When I first brought my baby home I never slept because I had postpartum depression and  I was always afraid something would happen to him. Then I got this monitor and once I realized I could make it chirp when the baby moves I was able to relax because I didn't have to stare at the baby all night, I would just listen for the reassuring chirp and then go back to sleep. I owe so many nights of great sleep to the snuza.We did get a couple of false alarms when his diaper was too loose but that doesn't bother me because at least I knew that it worked. Though we did have a real alarm once. One night I heard the alarm go off and went in the room to discover the straps on my baby's sleeper/rocker bed had come loose, allowing him to turn sideways, which caused his nose and mouth to become completely covered by the attached pillow, and he did not appear to be moving or breathing at all. I flipped him over and shake him awake and luckily he did wake up shortly. I hate to think what could have happened if the Snuza alarm hadn't alerted me.",5
3647,"I have used the Snuza Hero with my youngest two children. I only wish I had known about this product when my other kids were young.With our first Snuza, the battery lasted a full year. With our most recent Snuza, the battery needed to be replaced after nine months. Either way, that's a pretty good battery life for something that is used every day for hours at a time.We had very few false alarms with either unit. With my daughter, it was mostly operator error. We did see a slight increase in false alarms when she began sleeping on her stomach, so we began to clip the unit to the back of her diaper and the false alarms stopped. With our son, he is a much more restless baby when going to sleep, so the unit has on occasion become dislodged.The reason I chose the Snuza style monitor over an Angel Care style monitor is because of size and portability. We travel a lot and we camp quite a bit. Because the Snuza simply clips to the diaper or pants, we can take it anywhere easily, in the crib at home, in the playpen camping, at my mother-in-law's house in her guest bed, etc.",5
3648,"As a first time mom, I am terrified of SIDS!  The first night my baby slept in her crib this was attached to her! It's so comforting knowing she's breathing and I don't have to stare at her all night long!  I thought the fact that it attaches to her diaper would irritate her but she doesn't even know it's there. Luckily we haven't had any false alarms like other members have but I feel comfortable knowing my baby is breathing! The light can be seen through her pajamas but I can't see it through w baby monitor. That's my only downside but that would just be an extra perk in my opinion :) Although it's a bit pricey it's well worth the money!",5
3649,"We only used this for a couple of weeks with our son. We probably should have returned it, but never did just in case.Yes, it does a good job of monitoring for breathing. If your baby moves around a fair amount while sleeping, though, it'll get knocked loose frequently and will cause you to run in and check on them far too often (and you'll have a hard time going back to sleep even after a false scare).I thought this would make us sleep easier, but it ended up having the opposite effect. Your mileage may vary.",3
3650,"Not much else to say! These loop onto any pacifier very easily, and they clamp so awesomely into clothes without damaged the clothes and without slipping.I previously used the nuk and another name brand pacifier holder for our baby's nuk pacifiers, but it can be tough getting the plastic loops onto the pacifier, and the plastic clips easily slid off baby's clothes, so I now far prefer these PaciGrips!",5
3651,"I love almost everything about this monitor! The only thing I don't really use is the music. I don't think there is a way to adjust the volume for it either. I like the intercom and that the monitor will let you know the temperature of the room! Having this video monitor has brought me peace of mind when putting my baby down for bed because I can see her! I also like that you can add more cameras without having to get another monitor. The price was good and I would recommend this product for others to purchase!",5
3652,"I did get another brand that worked the same but was a bit longer, which I like, but this was is very good, too.  No complaints.",5
3653,"Love these ! Fits all the different sized cups & no more constantly bending over to pick up the cup !!",5
3654,"They're okay--I got them because my 11 month old is very difficult to diaper these days.  You still need to get both legs in.  We tried to skip the snappy and improvise a pocket diaper situation, but it didn't work.",3
3655,"Luckily, my baby was born in winter. This thing will get very hot, very quickly for a summer baby. It was outgrown in about 2 months. Although, my baby did find it very snuggly and enjoyed being in it. I could even remove with from the Ergo and set him in his swing all snuggled up without waking him. If you are out and about a lot with your baby, I can see it coming in handy.",3
3656,"I needed something that stored well because we lived in a tiny apartment.  This thing is well padded and fits well in the kitchen sink.  I never tried it in the bathroom sink, but I think it would work just as well.  We now use it in our larger/deeper kitchen sink in our house.  Love that I can still put it away.",5
3657,"I was lucky enough to get both the monkey and elephant at my baby shower. This has been a cute little toy for my 3  month old. He smiles and laughs when I pull it and it makes noises. I have probably done it 100 times with each toy and the batteries are still good. I&#8217;m always worried about buying these types of toys in the store because I don&#8217;t know how many other people have come along and played with it in the store and used up the batteries. I always try to grab one from the back of the shelf, hopefully my friends did that when they bought them for me. I see someone posted a way to replace the batteries, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m that motivated to do it when they die. I&#8217;ll try to update my post when the batteries die so you know approximately how long they last.To activate the sound you have to pull on the bottom pretty hard. I&#8217;m sure it will be quite awhile before my son has the strength to do that. Until then he gets a kick out of someone else pulling it. There&#8217;s only a couple things I would change on it. I wish there were a little more to the toy. Like crinkly ears, a squeaker or a rattle inside. The noise it makes is the only thing it does. When the battery dies it&#8217;s pretty useless.  I also think it&#8217;s overpriced for what you&#8217;re getting. Aside from that, I think it&#8217;s a cute little toy that is a good addition to our toy box. I carry it in the diaper bag so when we are waiting around someone (like my older daughter&#8217;s soccer practice or the doctor&#8217;s office) I can get a few minutes of entertainment out of it before my son gets bored and fussy.",4
3658,"these fit the dr browns bottles perfectly like they should, the only minor frustration is getting the holes to line up just right with the oz markers. not a deal breaker.",5
3659,"My daughter is very picky and reacts badly to increases in nipple flow or any changes. So, it makes a nice transitional step for us to have this option to affix to her regular bottle. I don't think the flow is very fast, possibly about the same as a level 3 Avent nipple, so this may not have proven to be helpful once we get to the next stage. At least it gets us over a technical requirement for her new big girl preschool.NONE OF THESE REVIEWS ADDRESS NATURAL style bottle and nipples VERSUS CLASSIC and which this fits. First of all, these are one-fourth this price at Buy Buy Baby. I drove far to go get them, taking my Avent Natural nipple ring to try with these, and indeed they DO NOT FIT THE NATURAL BOTTLES OR RINGS. And not many people use the Classic Avent anymore. So I had to buy the sippy cups with these nipples in order to use them. You need the Classic bottle rings to fit these to the bottles. Yes, that will work on the natural bottles. It is all very confusing and event Avent customer service had no idea...",4
3660,"well, i don't know how good the uppababby vista one is.(city versa is almost same model as uppababy vista)i've been use this stroller for over 3 months. I'm pretty sure this stroller is as good as the other one.(i've looked at the youtube video)this stroller maneuver so nice and easy even though the roads around my house aren't that great.i can go in and out of the door without help.i have the red one. it looks luxurious way more than it cost. when we're out in the public, almost all the time, people asks me about the stroller.(i live in small city, so i only saw graco, chicco, baby trend)folding is way easier than the handle turning thingy.i had a graco stroller that my friend gave me.that thing was so hard to close and open. finally, i gave up on that stroller cause it wouldn't turn anymore.Lucky me. i had a great deal with Amazon, too.only down part is...it's not compact stroller. if you have a small car, you will have only stroller in the car.",5
3661,"We have had the Uppababy Vista for about 4 years and love the fact that you can attach a glider board, rotate the seat and push with ease.  Unfortunately it takes up a ton of space and is really awkward and hard to fold.  So I went in search of a better option for our second child.  I think the Versa has many of the good things of the Vista (for about $400 less!) It pushes pretty easily but you can tell a notable difference when the basket is very full.  The easy fold is amazing when running errands.  While it is pretty heavy folding, its not unbearable.  Good quality and amazing value at this sale price.  I've recommended it to a couple friends.  It's a great stroller if you want quality and some good features, but not a luxury stroller price.  Don't hesitate",4
3662,"We have had this leak a little, but enough to get the kids wet while drinking (it drips). It is a very fun design though!",3

3664,"I have 2 of these and 2 Nuby transition cups, both kinds use the same sippy nipple.  The flow on the nipple is very near that of stage 3 Dr. Brown bottles.  My son loves that he can hold the cup and drink with the same speed as a bottle.  He is almost 7 months old and is trying to be independent and this allows some of that and still makes mommy comfortable... They grow so fast!",5
3665,"Maybe we started her on this too late.  She as already walking on her own at 12 months and we just wanted an easier way to hold on to her. But she HATED it.  Tried it twice and had to return it.  The quality was nice.... I think it was just our kid that didn't like it at all.",2

It is impossible to get the bumper to sit flat and look nice unless the mattress support for the crib is at the LOWEST possible setting otherwise it bunches up. If I could go back I'd just get the thinner one that doesn't cover the whole thing to begin with, but then I'm sure I'd end up with this one as my son is now standing. I'd buy both if you're just now putting a small (younger than 6 months) infant in it then upgrade to this when you put the crib on the lowest setting.",3
3671,"I bought this to store my son's coloring books, crayons, and art supplies. It works perfect. Each pouch is big enough to put lots of stuff in them. It is very sturdy.",4
3672,"The swaddle on my cover was too high up. If I was to try and use it I would be swaddling my baby's face, which might make him be still while getting his diaper changed, but may also cause him to be still for ever and ever. This is a terrible produce. It's better to just give your baby a toy to distract it while you're changing it's diaper.",1
3673,"Pretty design, lots of pockets, and not too deep so things don't get lost in it. I also like that it has a detachable shoulder strap.",5

3676,"If you can't tell by my review history, which only scratches the surface, my baby sorta has a small toy store at our home. This toy does not get much attention. It's not a bad toy. The quality is definitely 5 stars. Sturdy.  And it's ADORABLE. However, perhaps it's overly simplistic? By the time baby is interested in using it for it's intended function, I don't think it will interested her all that much. Right now she just chews on it for a few seconds then throws it aside. The older kids usually love playing with her baby toys (no idea why, but hey, whatever floats their boat) but I never see them playing with this one. I just think when you have so many toys to choose from, this one just doesn't make the &#34;must have&#34; list.",3
3677,"I really like this sleep sack for my daughter who outgrew her other one.  It's nice for summer and the design is great.  I didn't rate it 5 stars because night 2 of using it the zipper came undone (I had read this in previous reviews, but thought it might be a fluke, it's not).",4

3685,"BPA free plastics and nice shape for the development of your child's mouth. Highly suggest you get an 8 pack so you always have one around for a teething kid! Good luck and carry on!",5
3686,"These are great. We now have three in rotation for our 18month old. We started using them around 12months and have been completely off the bottle since. He can throw it on the floor turn it upside down and it doesn't break or leak. We use them for water during the day and one cup of milk before bed. With the warm milk a few drops will leak out of the straw since it is an otherwise sealed container but no mess just a few drops. Well worth the price, we use them constantly and they are still going strong after 6moths of all day every day use (haven't had to replace any parts yet). Also the company's customer service is amazing!",5
3687,"I love that the straw is weighted and that my son can get his milk from any direction. I had a hard time getting him to drink from a straw until this cup. However, it is expensive and it leaks. It was a great starter cup for us but we have moved on to the FP straw cup which hardly leaks and is a lot cheaper!",3

Pillow cases are not easy to find, it comes with it's own...but for me I prefer a traditional cotton or polyester cover. I purchased a few pillowcases and one Amazon had recommended that would fit...none of them did. However, I finally found one that did fit...you can get it at Walmart, its a travel pillowcase 15X20, polyester, and its a perfect fit, zips up and all!",5

He loves ridding in it still at one year. I've tried several different carriers and this one takes the cake by far! And  it puts zero strain on my back, don't even feel a thing.  In Love!",5
3693,"I really love this diaper bag.  Lots of pockets and enough space for a few diapers, package of wipes, muslin blanket, my wallet, keys, phone, sunglasses, and water bottle.  I still have some pocket space left after that.  Only downside is it does look more purse-like than something like the diaper dude bag, so guys may not like carrying this bag.",4
3694,"I have been searching for a smaller diaper bag since my son is now 18 mos and requires less stuff. I watched several YouTube videos that showed moms putting a ton of stuff in this bag, but it didn't work for me. I wanted to be able to carry the Be Quick wristlet with diapers and a small pack of wipes in it, two small Fisher-Price animal toys, a cup, a change of clothes, and a small first aid kit. I was able to fold up the clothes and put them in the inside zippered pocket, and I could slide the Be Quick into the center; however, I felt like everything else was simply too tight. I ended up exchanging it for the Better Be, and I absolutely love that bag. I think the Ju Ju Be fabrics are gorgeous, and the Royal Envy was exactly what I was looking for.I think if you are willing to have a very small bag with only diapers and maybe a cup and snacks, this bag could work for you. For me, I needed something slightly bigger, and the Better Be was much more up to par. My other two gripes about the Hobo Be are that (1) my husband thought that the shape was too girly and that he would feel like he was carrying a purse and (2) the changing pad is tiny and super thin. I never would have used that pad because my son's head and tush wouldn't have fit on it. Hence, I would have needed to use even more room to carry around a bigger changing pad or some of the disposable ones.",2
3695,"Great - works well with my In style pump and it is much lighter weight than the original Medela AC plug that cane with the pump.",5
3696,"If you read the description and understand what you are buying, this is a good product. Unlike other reviewers said, this is not cardboard. It is plastic - flexible plastic that could be cut with scissors, or, in my situation, pierced by dog teeth. However, I don't think a child could break this, unless that child can use scissors, or is too old to enjoy the mobile anyway. It is a good travel mobile for car rides, bassinets, play mats, etc. This is NOT a permanent mobile for the crib or anything like that. It's small, and as the name of the product says, is a &#34;mobile to go.&#34;",5

3699,"Cups with straws are better for you baby/child, but it's really hard to find good ones. We triedd 3 other brands before landing on these and haven't looked back. They're by far the best option out there with straws (still not 100% leak proof, but are far better than any of the others we tried).Really wish they made a smaller version with handles for beginners.",5
3700,"Here what I love about this cup:- It's big.  My daughter likes ice in her water, especially on a hot summer day.  At 12 ounces, there is plenty of room for ice and water to last an hour or two at the playground.- It's very easy to grasp.  At first I thought that I might want handles on it, but it's super easy to hold, pick up and drink from.- It fits in a car cupholder, stroller cupholder and diaper bag cupholder.  No bulky handles.  It's sleek and fits just about anywhere.- It's super easy to clean.  The straw comes apart in two pieces and fits perfectly in the dishwasher.  If you handwash, it might be a tight clean in the straw, but I have a brush that could do the trick.- It stays clear of germs.  Nothing is worse than a straw that just hangs out there for all the germs to jump all over. This one slides over the straw, protecting it when not being used.- It's leakproof.  For the most part.  See below...What I wish was a little different:- It's not obvious if the top isn't on perfectly and will immediately dump all over if tilted over.- When taking apart, the straw has to be perfectly up and down (not hidden under the protective plastic part) in order to get it apart.  If you forget and take the two pieces apart before the straw is out, it's impossible to take apart unless you put the lid back on and turn it that way. I know, it sounds confusing, but I have been annoyed by this more than once.At the end of the day, I would buy six more of these.  But, two is plenty.  My daughter loves them, they are leak proof and they are easy to clean.  Sold.",4
3701,"I love this stroller. I previously had the original cameleon and got the cameleon3 for my new baby. The improvements are great. First of all, it is the most stylish and sleek looking stroller out there. The bassinet is very big, much bigger than other strollers bassinet options. You can easily fit a baby in there thru 6 months old. The basket is a nice size, but it is difficult to get to it when using the bassinet option. It is much easier to use when you are using the seat. The seat reverses as does the handlebar, so you can always choose to have your baby facing you or the world. If you reverse the handlebar note that the big non swivel wheels will be in the front, making it slightly harder to push. I have done this on occasion when the baby was getting fussy while we were already out and about. The best improvement is the belly bar. On the original stroller you had to take the whole bar on and off and it was pretty difficult to do. On the new stroller you can easily take off one side and swivel it to get the baby on and off. The extended sun canopy was also a big improvement, although I did not buy the tailored fabric set at all, I bought the fully extendable breezy sun canopy and borrowed a bassinet apron from a friend (since you only use the bassinet for about 6 months and her child is older already). Also, bugaboo strollers have fantastic resale value so when you are done with yours you can usually sell it on craigslist or eBay for a good price.I checked out the uppababy vista, and while it seemed to have many of the same features as the bugaboo, it just felt like such a knockoff.  It is more affordable and also a good stroller, but the bugaboo is the original and the best!I don't take mine in the car much, but my neighbor takes hers all the time and has no problem folding and unfolding it. It folds pretty compactly because it is in two separate pieces.",5
3702,"I would be lost without our bugaboo. Our daughter arrived 12 weeks too soon, so when she finally came home from the hospital, she was very small and we used the bassinet stroller set up for quite a bit of time. This setting gave us another option for moving her around during her newborn &#34;fussy&#34; stage. We could easily switch out the bassinet for the car seat adapter for the Chicco Keyfit 30 we had. With a sleeping infant, the car seat adapter is the way to go. With clicking our daughter our of her car seat base and into the stroller adapter, we were able to move from one errand to the next without our daughter waking. It was a win/win for parents and baby. Once it was time to convert the stroller to its upright setting on its own, I was able to figure out most of the set up on my phone and only needed to look up a youtube video once to get a closer look on the final snaps.We live in sunny Arizona, so the sun shade is crucial for any time we spend outside, and the bugaboo shade has wonderful coverage. It does not take much to switch the direction the baby/child is facing while you are out and about to keep the sun out of their eyes. This stroller is so easy to push and turn. You can easily use only one hand to push it, and it navigates wonderfully.This stroller is wonderful for a trip to the park, grocery store, mall, or other recreational events. We've taken ours to the zoo, on dirt roads at a wild animal park, to a food truck festival on a dirt lot, and to the state fair. The stroller holds us well in all circumstances and provides a comfortable ride for our child every single time. Learning how to open the stroller takes some time, but once you get it down, it is easy to pull the stroller from the trunk and open it. Closing it is also easy. Just be careful not to slam it down on your foot, as I have done when not paying attention.My only complaint is that once it is converted to an upright stroller, it is hard to get the straps (five point harness) adjusted tight enough. My daughter is now completely capable of sitting in the stroller with minimal support, so it's no longer as issue. Granted, this stroller does not have that much storage space on the bottom, but it is very easy to clip additional items on to the stroller or hang a heavy diaper bag on the handle.I would recommend that soon-to-be parents go to a baby store and try out the stroller to make sure that it is something that would work for them. We did that before this was purchased as a gift and then we knew without a doubt that it would be a great stroller for us. Yes, it is pricey, but this is a stroller that will grow with your child in the years to come.",5
3703,"Great little dinosaur bottle. It is one of the best I've found on the market at the moment, Boon's bottles all leak. Highly recommend.",5
3704,"Bought this to go with my son's Monkey backpack and Monkey Lunchie bag. He will only drink from straw cups right now since he is 2.5, almost 3 and starting his summer program, he loves his little Monkey backpack and water bottle, he drinks from it with no issue. I love that is came with a replacement nozzle and plastic insert in case it breaks.",5
3705,"This was a purchase for my 15 months old daughter. We bought them in combination with the lunch bag and the water bottle and I am happy about all so far.I prefer steel utensils over any other stuff (slicone, bpa free plastic etc.). They are durable, safe and do not leak chemicals etc. It does not say what grade steel is used in these particular ones but, I guess it is either 18:10 or 18:8 since lower grade steel would darken or bend easily while these have done neither. They are dishwasher safe too.The plastic parts are easy to grasp for a toddler  and the lady bug pictures are lovely, besides, the steel and plastic bits are well attached (no loosening so far)However you should expect some wear-tear scratches and fading in the colorful bits (not after the first wash like some other reviewers complained but after a few months of daily use) which is no big deal for me.Finally the fork ends are a little rounded so they do not harm the kid easily.Over all, I am happy with the purchase. They are ergonomic, practical and not very expensive. They have helped my kid a lot in her way of gaining independence in feeding herself. I am sure they will last",5
3706,"The way the picture is taken, this looks a whole lot bigger than it is, but it is still really functional! It is really comfy and fits on my tub perfectly! (I have a standard flat edged tub). I would recommend this to anyone with small children! It may be small, but it still protects my elbows from hurting and it even has velcro to fold it up and a little velcro loop at the top to hang it up by!",4
3707,"Matches good with my Nuk Learner Cups. No problem with these bottles whatsoever. Cute design n everything. Been using them for 8 months now.",5
3708,"If your child is a finger chewer, I'd wager they'd love this teether!  Its strange looking.  As an adult, I think it looks weird and not like a whole lot of fun.  Just goes to show you what I know...  My 5 month old is a champion finger chewer and thumb sucker.  We looked for toys that were small enough to fit in her mouth for her to chew on as the classic teething rings and keys are waaaay too big for her.I googled &#34;top teething toys&#34; and this was on one of the lists.  I figured what the heck.  I sterilized it (in the dishwasher) and handed it over to my little one who immediately knew what to do with it.  She chews on the &#34;prongs&#34; and the ring itself.  My husband looked at it like it was the weirdest thing he'd ever seen (likening it to a diamond ring with no diamond) but clearly, the baby knows what she likes.I'd recommend this to anyone who has a finger chewer or if they have a little one who wants to put everything in their mouth but find traditional things a little too big.",5
3709,"Our baby is just starting to discover her hands and wants to nibble on things. We use this as a discovery toy and pacifier. The material is great and this is manufactured well. There aren't any sharp or rough seams. There are some tiny little dot nubs on each leg that are different on each leg to give some variety to the texture. I doubt a baby will notice, but it's extra attention to detail that shows the designer and manufacturer take this product seriously.",5
3710,"Love this teether!  You can attach it to car seat/stroller/cart cover, etc. and baby loves chewing on all the &#34;fingers&#34;.  Much better than baby trying to chew on me!I get many people who stop me and ask what it is and they all say what a great idea.",5
3711,"It is soft, flexible, easy to attach and easy to clean. Great teether for our beach camping trip. I would recommend it to others.",5
3712,"baby didn't like it. She's 15 months now and i have been trying to get her to like it, so far no luck.",3
3713,"My daughter loves this teether, and so do I. She really seems to enjoy gnawing on the 'legs,' and I love the fact that it keeps her busy and happy. As a happy bonus, you can easily use a pacifier clip or toy tether strap to keep it close.",5
3714,"My 16-month-old loves this for getting back to her incoming molars, but if she drops it, cleaning is a pain.  Grit, dust, dog hair, and lint all stick to this thing like glue, so a simple rinse doesn't usually get it all off.  Works well as a teether, but make sure to put it on some sort of tether, or you'll be cleaning it ALL the time.",4
3715,"My son is teething, and I wanted to find a toy that he could use while on tummy time...that wouldn't choke him if he fell on it.",4
3716,"I have been on the hunt for non-plastic, natural material teethers that are made in China. This teether perfectly fits the bill.  Designed in California, manufactured in Korea.  My 3.5 month old baby has been gumming everything and has loved this since the second I put it in her hands.  It is perfectly shaped for her to grab onto many different ways.  It is bigger than I expected but in a good way. The circular part is about 2 inches in diameter.",5
3717,"This teether is just the right size for small hands. My son is able to hold it with ease. He seems to like the texture of the rubber.",5

3719,"What's not to like? It's bright orange so it's easy to see for you and baby. It has a great name that's fun to say and baby can hold on to it from as soon as they can hold stuff. Plus it's beautifully designed.",5
3720,"Our cat randomly attacked our bumbo seat taking out chunks and leaving some holes. I was worried about the babe pulling off more chunks so I was about to toss the seat but this saved it! It is super easy to use, adorable, and good quality. Allows for the straps to come through which is essential.",5
3721,"My mom bought this for me when she bought my Bumbo. It's great because the plastic the Bumbo is made out of looks very uncomfortable and looks like it would stick to the legs. I like the cover!",5
3722,"We have gotten so many compliments on this item. It's really adorable on our son and we have gotten a lot of use out of it.",5
3723,"Great product so far (used for 3 trips over the past month). It is small but not tiny. Noise level can be pretty loud or quiet. Love that it has a wall plug. Haven't used it all night yet with just batteries, I only wanted that option for circumstances where we wouldn't have electricity. Love the sounds and baby sleeps really well with it!",5
3724,"Yes LOVE this machine!!! My girl is almost 2 and we use the plain white noise every nap and at night.  it is small nd unobtrusive but gets really loud and I LOVE that it plays indefinitely.  All of the other sounds are pleasant too! I have heard one too many sleep machines with just plain weird creepy sounding animals and obnoxious noises..... all of these are normal and pleasant!! we had the giraffe when she was a baby but i was sick of it turning off plus it was too quiet.  CANT believe it took me so long to find this and you seriously cant beat the price!!!also, i love that i can unplug it and just throw it in her diaper bag and use with batteries when she naps at grandparenst etc.  all though the batteries died quickly (maybe i have cheapo batteries)",5
3725,"I picked this item because it had white noise and could run off batteries or power cord.  Its great, you can adjust the volume, it has timer settings so it can turn off automatically which may be more useful for the other sounds but we leave the white noise running all the time.  Its portable, when we went on vacation recently we took it with us for our daughter's nap time so she wouldn't hear the pool activity outside our room while napping, it was a blessing.",4
3726,"We bought this on the recommendation of a few friends and we couldn't live without it! We keep it in our nursery and on the white noise setting. It is great because it is constant and not something that stops playing after 30 minutes. It definitely helps drown out the noise from the living room and washing machine while our little one naps and sleeps at night.",5
3727,"We had been using the fan funtion through our AC as white noise since my daughter was born. Not very efficient for a longterm solution. We bought this as a substitute and it is perfect!  Very small, yet capable of being very loud. I love the portability and plan to bring this with us on vacations.",5
3728,"I really love this stroller overall. I run with it several times a week (about 9-10 min/mile pace for 2-3 miles, as recommended), have used in while shopping, and my mom and husband have used it on walks around the nabe. We all really like it. My main complaint is that the front wheel shakes sometimes when running with it and takes a few seconds to correct. It's pretty annoying, and you're supposed to lock the front wheel when you're running, but our jogging paths are winding, so I can't do that. Still, its so easy to push otherwise, I love it anyway. (I have updated this review after more use. I like it even more now than I did)Likes:-It glides and maneuvers very well. I jog with one hand on the wheel and sometimes let go for a quick sec and it keeps on gliding. Sometimes I jog next to the stroller to talk to the baby and push and its just super easy.-finally! A magnetic peekaboo window closure. I've noticed some reviews state it is velcro, so this must be very recently added. Mine has magents not velcro.-Adjustable: handle bar and footrest. The asjustable footrest was very important to me. My baby is just more comfortable with a leg rest. It folds up to create a bassinet (And has fabric that buttons to close off any gaps, stays flat for an infant (my kid is one and still likes it flat), or all the way down for a bigger kid. When we aren't using the snack tray, I set cheerios along the flat foot rest for her.- SO PRETTY!-Canopy: It's huge! I Can pull it forward to literally block the sun at any angle, but I love to unzip the back so I can see her while we're walking or running. She LOVES to be able to see me while she's on the stroller.-Comfy: My baby is very sensitive and dramatic, and she has loved this stroller from the second I put her in it. I've never seen her take to something so quickly. She loves to be pushed around the house in it or just chill. She never chills otherwise. I think she feels cool in it. haha- Seat fabric: The temperature control fabric- I can't comment on how effective this is for the baby, but with how extreme the temperatures get here, both hot and cold, any temperature regulation has to help.-Outer Fabric: seems very durable and tough. (PET: recycled water bottles)-It really is the best all around stroller- I use it for jogging, shopping, throwing it in the trunk, city festival type events, etc. At 20 pounds you can even gate check it on a plane.-Thank goodness for the breakaway 5 point harness. This means it's 5 seperate pieces. My kid has not been interested in having her shoulders strapped in since she was about 6 months old. Use your own judgement on this. (I buckled all five and just made them very loose until I felt she could safely sit up on her own without the shoulder straps. now we just do the lap/crotch belts)-Bumper bar: one year old loves to hold on to this, bite it, I attach toys to it, etc.-This stroller is the best for a baby who likes to see out. This was one of the main reasons I bought and kept this stroller.Neutral:-The suspension is good, but again, it didn't amaze me. I was hoping for more. Maybe my expectations on this were too high. (this was a main reason for buying a new stroller. My baby doesn't like to be bumped around)Improvement suggestions:- they aren't kidding about the recline. Its terrible.- I wish it sat more upright. You can make the seat back 90 degrees, but the actual recline can't be tightened enough, so as soon as she puts her back against it, it reclines slighty. However, the seat fabric on the sides isn't super deep, so she can still see out with ease. (Tip: I have a generic parent tray and have found if it scoot it all the way down the handlebar it props the seat back up nicely.)- it is HOT and humid here (north Texas). Babe would appreciate some side mesh vents (with magnetic flaps)- Add an automatic lock when folded!-It isn't that compact when folded. Not just because of the wheels. This isn't a huge deal, I just wish it folded a little smaller. It takes up at least a third to half of the trunk in my Nisaan Murano.Overall, I love this stroller. I really want to give it 5 stars, and I almost did. There are just a few things that need to be improved in my opinion for such a pricey stroller, but I am cheap :) It definitely has a high quality look and feel.",4
3729,"Just like all of the aden & anais muslin blankets we received. This changing table cover is lovely. They all wash clean every time with no stains and the colors hold up really well when washed with Ecos natural detergent and oxygen bleach. It will last for years and the design is so sweet. I highly recommend.",5
3730,"These are kind of cute, kind of creepy. The elephant heads are poorly sewn on and I am just waiting for them to be pulled off. The material they are mounted on is really soft. The width is alright for most car seats and strollers but I tried them on our ergo carrier and they were much too thin. The price was nice but its almost worth paying a little extra for better quality.",2
3731,"I purchased this because I liked the colors and thought the elephants look nice in the picture but was disappointed when I received it.  The elephants basically look like little rats and the colors are not as nice as they look in the picture.",2
3732,"LOVE LOVE this teether toy!  My girl's favorite.  Easy to grab, easy to clean, the fact its flat makes it easy for her to chew front or back teeth.  Definitely worth the investment!",5
3733,"I purchased the Rock 'N Play Bassinet about two months before the birth of my son because Amazon was running a $20 off promo so this was a steal at $52. I looked at other bassinets and considered co-sleepers but at this price I thought, give it a shot.I received at my baby shower the Rock 'N Play Sleeper, which has an inclined sleeping surface. It is about the same price as what I paid for the bassinet.In the first few weeks, I used the Bassinet at night and the Sleeper in the kitchen/living space as a place to put Baby for naps. Initially Baby preferred the incline because he was often spitting up and had gas. After a month, he didn't need the incline and napped fine on any flat surface (Bassinet, Graco Pack 'n Play or crib). We have packed away the Sleeper, which folds very conveniently.  I didn't want to continue to use the Sleeper because it didn't look like his legs were comfortable. Baby kicks a lot and the Sleeper doesn't have enough space for Baby to rest his legs in the appropriate 'froggy leg' position. I also didn't want him to prefer an incline if he didn't need it. Now that Baby is more awake during the day, we use a bouncer in the kitchen/living space in place of the Sleeper.The Bassinet is still being used at 7 weeks at night at our bedside. The 'mattress' (and I use that term loosely) is only 29 inches long and my son is already 23 inches long. He has room to wiggle but I am cautious to make sure that his head is not too close to the sides where it is not mesh. The mesh is only 16 or so inches long on the side.For our next Baby, I would use the Bassinet again but I would purchase a bassinet mattress. Obviously Fisher-Price only tests and recommends use of their pad, but the mattress pad is already looking worn and shrunken after 10 washes. I laundered it according to directions at least once a week and when there is severe spit up incidents.The top bar of the Bassinet is the height of our bed, which is convenient to peer into but being so low I have to get up out of bed to pick him up. I don't use the rocking feature because Baby tends to lean into the side and the rocking motion assists in getting him pushed into the mesh. I don't care the for mirror and I wish it was detachable.I hope to use the Bassinet for at least 3 months. He is 12 lbs and 23 inches at 7 weeks so it might not last. The weight limit is 25 lbs but I can't imagine a baby that size in this. He should be rolling over before that weight! My biggest concern is that he will snuggle up to the side that is not mesh.There is room for improvement with the Bassinet but I found it to be a good value.",4
3734,"This little Tigger is so soft and perfect for baby. It plays music and his cheeks light up. Only thing is, when his battery dies, he will just be a stuffed animal. Batteries can not be replaced which is a little disappointing.",3
3735,"I recommend getting a couple of these - very useful to keep on your changing mat for baby pee accidents, and it's a lot easier to change and throw in the wash than taking off the changing pad cover.  Good price on Amazon, and washes well.",5
3736,"I use this with my newborn everywhere. On our bed, during tummy time, another one (clean!) on the changing table, on the pack and play, in the crib, one folded up in the diaper bag for on the go changes. Truly versatile. After repeated washings it holds up well. I have the Lily Pad Frog print as well as others, so I know which print goes on the changing table.",5
3737,"We loved this potty, especially since it flushed. Be careful though because it's made more for little boys with the high splash gaurd. My daughter had problems getting on and off of it however.",4
3738,"We use this out of the bath, he loves to run around and collect random things in the net. Keeps my busy boy entertained for ages!",5
3739,"Inexpensive. Easy to use. Work well. One star lost because they aren't really leak proof. Not bad leaky but not leak proof.",4
3740,"We love these sippy cups.  They are a good size for little hands, cup holders (in the car seat and on her high chair), and in diaper bags.  They click when the lid is locked in place and will not come off.  They do leak a little, but the only times I have seen them leak (and I'm talking about a drops, not puddles) is when our daughter turns it upside down and shakes it or throws it to the ground and it lands with the mouthpiece closest to the ground and is full of liquid.  We like the Nuby sippy cups, but the handles on those make them hard to put in cup holders and outside pockets on the diaper bag.",5
3741,"My granddaughter LOVED being swaddled and slept well each night, but we started to worry when she flipped over onto her tummy at 5 months and her arms were still inside the swaddle.  My daughter then put the baby in a swaddle with her arms free, but the baby would wake up several times each night (she was still startling at five months).  Found this &#34;magic&#34; suit and it is MAGIC.  From the first night the baby was put to bed in the suit, she slept through until morning.  I think it worked for my granddaughter because when she startled and her arms jerked, the heavily padded sleeves of the sleep suit kept her arms from bouncing hard off the crib mattress, and she was able to sleep through the startle. Family members debated whether she looked like an astronaut or the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man.  She is now nine months old and can actually sit up with the sleep suit on--a strong core already! She's ready for pj's now.",5
3742,"This worked great for transitioning out of the swaddle. It did take about a week for the &#34;magic&#34; to happen but when it did it lasted for a couple of months until my son started rolling and it wasn't safe anymore. I love the product but the price is alot to swallow for 2 months of use. I guess you can't put a price on a good night's sleep though, right?",4
3743,"I have heard that the sleepsuit either works and doesn't work at all. We were lucky enough that it worked for my daughter. At 3 months we put her in the suit (once she was getting out of all swaddles and waking up every 2 hrs) and she started sleeping through the night. I highly recommend this to all parents who have babies that are 3-6mo and don't sleep through the night. It's def worth a try!",5
3744,"Baby began breaking out of his swaddle at three months and neither of us were getting a good nights rest. I was constantly worried about the swaddle being around this face as he squirmed out and he was waking frequently as his arms hit his face. The sleep suit was a great solution that gave me peace of mind and baby a peaceful nights sleep. The thick material prevented his random movements from disturbing his sleep and I could sleep soundly knowing he was safe.",5
3745,"The main reasoning I wanted to try this is to get my baby out of the rock and play, and into his crib. I used it the first night and he still woke up twice but he did fall asleep on his own in his crib, which was very cute. I tried two more nights, but even in early April it was way too hot. My poor baby was drenched in sweat even with the a/c and a ceiling fan on. I returned it and used Halo swaddle sacks in size small (3-6 months) and they worked great. He hasn't been in the rock and play since the first night.",3
3746,"My 4.5 month old baby could not stay swaddled anymore and began waking up several times each night after sleeping all night since 2 months old.  I tried this suit and she immediately began sleeping 10 hours straight thru the night.  She's sleeping better now than she was swaddled.",5
3747,"We have the Uppababy cruz stroller. My son likes to eat from it and will place his toys on it as well. He gets upset if we remove it from the stroller. I give it four stars because I think this should be included with the stroller, since uppababy cruz does not  include a safety bar with stroller. It is overpriced and should not have to be purchased separately.",4
3748,"Cute bedding set for my 2 year old. Colors are as pictured. So fair it has been washing nicely with no fading.",5
3749,"Cup has one major flaw in my experience with our 12 month old daughter. We can't see how full the cup is when helping her drink from it so we're not always sure how far to tip it. There should be a gap in the anemone graphic to see the water level",3
3750,"I'm not a huge fan of pack-n-play sheets.  I don't think it's as much the sheet's fault as it is the pack-n-play.  The sheet needs to be snug, so it's got a good elastic band (like a typical fitted sheet), but it's such a strong elastic that it tends to pull up the sides of hte pack-n-play board (&#34;mattress&#34;).  The material on this particular sheet is very soft, which is a huge plus.  It just irks me when I put it on my set that the bottom board tends to buckle and it takes a few tries to get it to stay flat.",4
3751,"We use these on the regular changing table and pad to save the changing pad covers from being washed all the time. Not exactly waterproof but if you are right there and grab it once they have an accident sans diaper it doesn't leak through. We have multiple sets and definitely recommend. I've never dried them in the dryer though, I lay flat to dry and don't have to worry thy it may curl up.",5
3752,"They freeze easy and are great for little hands. My only complaint is that they don't hold water well. They are nice if the infant likes cold on their teeth.",4
3753,"Read the great reviews, but very disappointed with this cup.  The lid has so many grooves and crevices, which makes it impossible to clean well.  Its difficult to control the amount of water coming out, and a pain to get it just right.",2
3754,"We have used this on the car seat while on an airplane, stroller while shopping, on crib for night time and so much more.  Really helps keep them asleep by drowning out the noises around.  Batteries can go quick but it's worth it!",5
3755,"I bought this merely for the great price and I'm really glad I did!  It works great and fits in a diaper bag or purse compartment with ease.  Although, made of hard plastic and would not recommend being hung where it could fall on baby, it can definitely be hung elsewhere because the volume/sound is great.  I can't wait to take it on road trips to visit in-laws and on vacation when we only have travel stuff with us.",5
3756,"I like that we can take this anywhere with us.  We usually need &#34;white noise&#34; when we stay at relatives or hotels, and this will save us from having to use our app on our IPhones.  Also handy during a few tantrums we have had to distract her from crying.",4
3757,"Love this. So easy to use and the volume/ sounds are perfect.  Batteries run out after a short while but keep extras on hand and you will be fine.",5
3758,"I LOVE this and so does my baby...it keeps her calm when we're out and about and also in the car...a must have for any mom with an infant!",5
3759,"This is a great, portable sound machine for anyone with infants looking for some white noise. My only suggestion would be to make the power button a switch, instead of the large button on the front. The button on the front is easily hit when transporting, which turns on the unit, which (you guessed it) runs the battery down. If the unit had a recessed power switch, this would alleviate the issue in most circumstances.",4
3760,"My dogs chewed up the zipper of my previous bra just like this, so I had to order another one.  I love how I can be handfree to still interact with my children or get other things done such as put on makeup, go on my laptop, etc.  I also like how the back has a portion where it is velcro so one can adjust it accordingly/.",5
3761,"I don't know what I would do without this bra.  It's incredible!  My only regret was not ordering it soon enough!  My sister recommended it after she saw me attempting pump both breasts and hold the parts.  I cannot tell you enough that this is a MUST for anyone pumping!",5
3762,"Using it as we speak. The best part about this bra is the velcro on the back that has allowed me to adjust down as I've lost weight post pregnancy. Other than that, it's just a great idea. It's soft, supportive and comfortably fits the large flanges from my Medela pump in style. It has held up well over one wash, but I'd recommend not putting it in the dryer, it got a bit tighter. Additionally, it is a little bulky. I had intended to wear it under my clothes as a bra, but with the extra fabric at the back and cup area, it's just too bulky to wear under anything that's not a little baggy. So, I have to carry it to work in my breastpump bag and change bras to pump. Not fun, but it is comfortable so I'd wear it as a bra under a baggier outfit...",5
3763,"I got this one as an extra for work so I didn't have to bring it back and forth; it was too firm and rigid for my taste, made the flanges pinch me no matter how much I loosened the thing, and was awkward to size and put on and off. I went back to the simple Medela one in less than a week.",2
3764,"they're all going to leak occasionally. this was the most reliable brand i tried, maybe 2 or 3 leaks in hundreds of bags. i tried a few others but kept coming back to these. easy to pour in and out. can label with any pen or marker. no regrets.",5
3765,"I wish I had bought this sooner! So lovely and what a sweet way to protect my baby! The cloth is super soft and we love it.",5
3766,"I couldn't decided which mat I wanted so I ordered this one and another one (which was $10 more). This one was larger and thicker, but the quality was not as good so I decided to return it. It's been a few days and it still hasn't completely unrolled.The difference between this and other better Korean mats is the materials. This is more like a large piece cushion like the stuff you use in shipping/packing, except it has a coating of rubber/plastic with cute designs. To finish of the ends, they use a polyesterish type fabric sewed all the way around. Even though it's extremely large, it's also extremely light... I could toss the large box around from one hand to the other.If I didn't know any better, I would think it's not bad. However, I've seen what real good quality Korean baby play mats are supposed to look like and I received my second mat the same day. That one was legit - it's slightly thinner, but it's the memory type foam that Americans sometimes use in bathrooms and kitchens in front of the sink. As soon as I unwrapped that one, it laid flat.  It's also 2-3x heavier than this one.",3
3767,"These funky birds are super cool and make a really neat chime too... Baby LOVES them! I highly recommend them!",5
3768,"I truly don't know why everyone doesn't use a waterproof diaper changing pad.  OK, so this guy is pretty pricey, BUT it saves you the trouble of having to constantly take off, wash, and put back on fabric changing pad covers... like you don't have enough else to do with a baby.  My daughter loves to pee and poop while we're changing her.  We can often catch it in the fresh diaper, but for those special times when we can't, this changing pad makes it no big deal.  You just wipe the mess right off and keep it moving.I also really like the high raised edges and I don't worry that she's going to be able to roll off the table.  We have the lilac color, which is really beautiful and adds a nice visual element to the room.  Other reviews said that the changing pad is cold, but it doesn't seem to bother our baby.  We just make sure to change her diaper before feeding her in the night so that she can go right to sleep in her milky coma.",5
3769,"Looks good. Seems comfortable for my baby. Just as describe. Goes well with deco. I'd recommend this to a friend!",5
3770,"I love this changing pad! It is perfect. Soft for baby, while being easy to wipe clean if necessary. So much better than cloth changing pads that need to be laundered!Based on a review that suggested leaving a small blanket on it to keep it warmer, I have been leaving a spare baby swaddle blanket on the top half and lay our son on top of blanket. Totally worth the price!!!",5
3771,"If I were to have gotten these, I would have purchased them sooner. By the time my baby needed them, her legs were too big and they didn't even fit. I'd return them if the return wasn't all the way in China, so I'm just taking the loss.",3
3772,"after initial wash to get the factory smell out off the fabric, it already looked super worn. not that great but serves its purpose.",2
3773,"I bought this product so my triplets would take their reflux medicine better since it cannot be mixed with anything. This product is awful. They didn't even know how to use it much and they take new things easily (ie: pacifier changes, etc.). I had been using a medicine bottle type dispensor which was working ok but they could taste it. This product claimed to bypass the taste buds. It doesn't, they made horrible faces, indicating they could taste the medicine. Wish I could return it but I opened the packages for each girl to try :-(",1
3774,"when my baby was on breastmilk I thought what a waste of money! Once he started solids I was so glad I purchased this. a must-buy for babies on solids!",5
3775,"I bought this off my registry so that my newborn would have a nice soft pad to lay on, but I soon realized that changing pad covers are totally impractical and I won't be getting a lot of use out of this. Babies leak fluids from every whole, and the changing pad (obviously) gets pretty dirty. Taking a cover on and off of it multiple times a week (if not multiple times a day) is impractical. It is much easier to just wipe down the plastic pad when it gets dirty.  I will admit that the heavy use of my changing pad has already lead to a rip in the center, and keeping it covered would have probably protected it better, but the changing pads are cheap enough that I can just toss this when it's beyond repair and buy another. Unless you are planning to stock up on changing pad covers so you can change it daily, there is really no need to have one.  I will say that this one did wash well and was both soft and absorbent.",3
3776,"So as a first time mom with a busy 10 month old I got tired of trying to carry two bags plus my antsy little one..but I also didn't want to take her owl diaper bag out in public; I needed something that looked like a purse but functioned like a diaper bag and let me tell you I love this one. It is so cute and it fits all my baby's things and all of mine its absolutely great. I'm so happy I got this",5
3777,"Great bag. It's large, looks trendy and good quality. Only annoyance as others have mentioned is the straps fall off shoulder constantly. I had to get one of those handle snaps that comes on luggage to keep my handles together and on my shoulder. I don't regret getting the bag though. It's a good enough bag for the price.",4
3778,"I use this on my City Mini Double stroller (side by side stroller).  It fits much better than the City Mini brand version.  Just turn the whole thing around so that the label so that &#34;Bob&#34; is upside down ,then attach to the handlebars.  I like it a lot!",5
3779,"Our daughter has always been a runner and has missed being able to do so during her pregnancy.  We gifted her and her husband with the BOB stroller that she especially wanted, and along with it Amazon offered this handlebar console.  The parents-to-be are looking forward to using the stroller and this console allows them to take along items that they need within easy reach.",5
3780,"They work well, are portable, easy to change a roll, easy to use, and have an agreeable-enough scent. What more can I say?",5
3781,"I love having these in the diaper bag and being able to use them when I am out with my 4-month old and he needs a diaper change. They are big enough that you can tie a knot, smell nice and are strong (I have never had one rip). Highly recommend!",5
3782,"The only poop bags we use. I've tried other off brands and they just stink and don't work. Highly recommended!",5
3783,"Like it.",4
3784,"Tons of room. Easy to just throw stuff into it.lots of pockets to keep things. Worth the price but around $40 would have been more reasonable.",5
3785,"Seems pretty strudy and was comfortable for a toddler...only negative is that the drawstring broke on the bag to hold",4
3786,"We bought this because have a high table.I love how you can adjust the size.Padding colors are light, so washing on a regular basis is neededI do not use the blue removable tray, it is easily removed by a 10moTrays fir in the dish washer, but take up a lot of space.Padding is thinBuckles are good and semi easy to useStays firmly in place",4
3787,"I got this for my daughter when she was 4 or 5 months old. She's now 8 months old and doesn't pay much attention to this. She liked chewing on the crinkly rabbit ears a little, but it didn't really help her and she lost interest quickly.",2
3788,"My daughter loved munching on this even before she started to actively teeth. It is nice that it has different textures and hard/soft areas. Only slight issue is the fabric tends to collect lint really easily but it helps to be a reminder to clean it regularly.",5
3789,"This teething ring is by far my baby's favorite! She loves the different textures. After I wash it up I stick it to the fridge so its cold and she loves it. I also live that the cloth part reaches to the back teeth.",5
3790,"I love everything about this teether!  It's a great size for a 4mo old to hold. There are several different textures and chew options for him...plus the two crinkly piece have a good sound to get his attention.  Totally in my diaper bag!",5
3791,"Purchased for my granddaughter who started cutting teeth at 4 months.  She is 19 months and still likes to teethe on toys.  She absolutely loves this teether.  Her favorite part is the tags on top, but she has chewed on all sides of this teether.  Great price, great teether.",5
3792,"My son is teething and he has been miserable.  The nice thing about this toy is that it is small but big enough for him to direct into his mouth himself.  He likes it because he can be more independent with it.  The reason for the 4 stars is because he just doesn't play with it that much and you can't chill it like many of the other teethers.  My husband also has an issue that you can't easily sterilize the fabric attachments, this toy stays at home so I am not so worried about it but I can see his issue.  Overall, it is a good product, well put together.",4
3793,"Overall, I like this bag. It does not LOOK like a diaper bag. There is plenty of storage room and pockets and the material is lightweight. The problem is that if it is packed full, it weighs down the back of an umbrella stroller. This is fine if my daughter is in the stroller, but the minute she gets out, the stroller flips over. Granted, this is a limitation you will experience with any bag on the  back of an umbrella stroller, so be forewarned.I've been using the bag for about a month now and the construction seems pretty nice. I really like the three pockets on the front of the bag that allow for quick access to things like keys, cell phone, and wallet.",4
3794,"So easy to use and clean. It really is a nice way to store homemade baby food. The only problem I have had is buying the bags to go with it for the first few months I had it I couldn't use it because I used the 10 bags they give with it and then I couldn't buy anymore because they have been out of stock everywhere they have since come back in stock but I hope this isn't a problem all the time they must be a hot item right now",5
3795,"I have used it several times already. Makes filling bags much easier although never tried without a &#34;filling station&#34;. Can still be messy, taking bags off and disconnecting tubes from bags; but worth it. My 16 month twins eat 1 - 3 bags each a day and have a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. The reach out for the bags when the see them. Also fill bags with yogurt and fruit.",5
3796,"Love this product! It's easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store. Highly recommend it and it's great all by itself the funnel is unnecessary.",5
3797,"I love this product - it is a must have for babies and even older kids.PROS:Easy to assembleEasy to useYou get to easy feed/store/make fresh food for your babies/kidsIt is dishwasher safe and disassembles easily to washIt's awesomeCONS:It can get a little messy when using it ... but not as messy as spoon-feeding your baby from a bowl. It's super easy to clean, so this is really a non-issue.This item is awesome because you can continue to use it as your kid grows. You could make applesauce with sweet potatoes into the packets, toss them in your kids' lunch, and it will be defrosted by lunch time. Its fun, practical, and again - easy to use.ALTERNATE USE: My baby (9 months) eats out of packets herself. One day, I bought a ton of organic tubs because they were on sale and I had a coupon. I ended up putting those tubs into the packets (right before she ate them, I didn't freeze them), and she ate them just fine. Easy, easy! :)Don't think - just buy.",5
3798,"Love them great to take along and store. I use them all the time and don't have a bad thing to say",5
3799,"I know that they are more expensive since disposable but concerns about refillable ones leaking and not being cleaned properly. Also like that I can see product to ensure nothing looks spoiled and see how much is left in the bag; can help the toddler squeeze up what is left at the bottom.",5
3800,"I was under the impression these packets were reusable. I did not use them, but they seem to be durable & of good quality. I just thought it was wasteful, expensive, and tedious to use these packs and the Infantino Squeeze Station.",3
3801,"This is one of those things you get because &#34;it would be nice to have&#34; but ends up being more valuable than you would think. I LOVE how this keeps her pouches organized in the freezer! I need another one, I think! It only holds maybe 8-10 pouches, which isn't bad, but sometimes I would like to make more pouches in one go to have on hand. The price is right. Quality product that makes life easier and more organized.",5
3802,"These pillows are small, but too &#34;thick&#34; for a toddler - they look more like pillows I would decorate the couch with. Not comfortable to sleep on. Better to use a full size pillow - no toddler sleeps in the same spot all night long. Regret wasting my money on this!",1
3803,"Much more firm and fluffy than I would want for my DS neck.  Liked the size, but was too billowy to use.  I use it for travel.",2
3804,"I have bought a few pillows now for my two year old. We have converted her crib into a toddler bed and most pillow are either too big or too small. This pillow is a perfect size for toddler beds.  I am going to buy another one so I can switch them out to wash.  This a great pillow for your 18 mo., two or three year old.  Wish I had gotten this one before I bought all the other pillows.",5
3805,"Great pillow for toddler. Its soft and nice. My son loves it!! Just get a cover for it. I wash it with the pillow case on it and its great.",5
3806,"but it isn't absorbent. It is very pretty to look at and very soft, but the absorbency was so disappointing. I can't really use it as a burping cloth for the newborn so we put it on my older son and used it as a bib to protect his clothing. It works just fine in that capacity.",3
3807,"don't buy any other type of burp cloth! these are amazing. super soft and love that it's curved. it double as a bib for when they get older which, I personally wouldn't use (like the bumpkins for that) but others might love that feature.",5
3808,"Great seat. Comfortable and fits over an elongated bowl. Allows your child to sit in so they cannot wiggle off. I have a girl but have older boys and this would block you from getting streamed.",5
3809,"We have one of these right now and our daughter really likes it.  I had bought a different plastic one at a local store and she hated it...said it was too hard.  This fits great on all of our elongated toilet seats.",5
3810,"We have mostly Alva diapers (which we love) but we also love these diapers! The double open ends make it sooo much easier to get the liners out. We double stuff all our diapers and these hold two liners perfectly. There's really no complaints about these diapers besides I wish I would have found them before I purchased the majority of my stash.",5
3811,"Very convenient and useful for busy parents as it steams and pur&eacute;es in the same bowl.  The recipe booklet is very handy, especially for parents who are most starting to give solids and wonder what consistency a particular item should be.",5
3812,"Potty training can be frustrating but clean up is a breeze with these liners. I was skeptical when I first touched them but they have held up so far.  It fits the Bjorn Potty perfectly (same one on that is shown on the cover of the package). The waste doesn't sit for more than ten minutes in the potty. She either gets wiped up or washed up immediately, diapered, changed and then we go back and dump the bag in the toilet. I let the bag sit in my toilet for the bag to break down a bit (not a necessity but I'd rather it break down than back up my pipes). These bags are a bit pricey but sooooo worth the ease of cleanup.",5
3813,"I wanted to use glass for all of my daughter's food, but daycare wouldn't let me send it in, so I tried these.  Well, they have been way better than the GreenSprouts glass containers in the long run.Pros: Multiple sizes. Measurements/markings won't rub off. Tight seal. Stack nicely with or without the tray. Haven't stained or cracked.  Lids come apart/go together easily.  Easy to clean by hand or dishwasher (see below).  Room on lids of both sizes for a Dr. Brown's dot label.Cons: Not 100% leak proof in every situation (but pretty close).  Will etch/pit if overheated (This happened at daycare; we only heat on 1/2 power at home).  If using the dishwasher (or at least a crappy one like ours), gunk can get stuck in the lid, so it's best to hand wash or take the lids completely apart (I recommend doing this often anyway).My daughter is no longer eating soft foods, but we still use these to portion her meals for daycare.  And the 2 oz container makes a fantastic salad dressing holder for my own lunches!",5
3814,"Easy to use especially if you're making your own baby food. I use the Beaba babycook Pro (WHICH I LOVE BTW!!!) and these sit in my fridge. They lock tight and the food tastes fresh. I might need to buy another set just to keep one in the freezer. We go through the whole set in a 1/2 weeks worth of baby food.",5
3815,"This is a good set, especially because it does not let freezer odors creep thru to the baby food. But for the number of boxes that come with it - its a little pricey. I have not found it convenient to carry from freezer to diaper bag. But its a good buy and getting good use of it.",4
3816,"We've used this monitor for about 1.5 years without too many problems. We have the camera up on a high shelf looking down on the crib so you can see what's going on. The picture quality is good enough to see where your baby is, but it can be hard to make out much else especially using the night vision. We've never had a problem with getting woken up when baby starts to cry, but there is a noticable hiss of static if you have it set loud enough to make sure it comes through (I can sleep through anything, especially white noise so no big deal for me). I wish the speaker would only come on if it detects a sound above a certain threshold. I thought that's what the VOX would do, but apparently not. Range is good enough inside the house, although it does sometimes lose connection. I haven't had the problems other people have reported, but maybe we're just lucky. This is our only baby monitor so I have nothing else to compare it to. Overall, we're pretty happy with it.",3
3817,"I bought this set at IKEA and it's a lot cheaper to get it there. 6 bowls are $2.50, 6 cups are $2.50, and 18 utensils are $2.50. So you can get the entire set shown here for $7.50 at IKEA.  If you don't have an IKEA nearby then $15 isn't bad, but I almost bought something on Amazon once but I read a review from someone about buying it at the actual store and I saved a ton of money.  Since, then, I always try to pass on the tip.The product itself is awesome, so buy away if you can't get to IKEA.",1
3818,"My kids love these. They love that I let them use knives (they're 2 and 4)! Forks and spoons are probably a bit too large/long for my 2-yr-old but he MUST do whatever his older bro does, so of course he uses them anyway. We've used these (approximately) a million times since purchase 8 mos ago and still love the whole set. All the colors are fun!",5
3819,"This play yard does its job and is not to hideous, but I hate how the door hangs all floppy and lopsided, and how it doesn't close automatically. I do like that you can add on. We use 2 full sets around a 4 x 4 grid of 24&#34; foam blocks and it's a perfect, large playyard with a ton of room.I am very glad I splurged for the nice wooden North States play yard instead for our bedroom, though. It's much more attractive, taller, and much sturdier, with an auto-latching door.",3
3820,"I spent a LOT of time researching play yards and finally went with this one. And I think it was a good decision.Good:* No cross-bars baby can climb* Door for my petite wife to be able to get in* White -- wife refused to have primary colors in the living room* Height* Good stability* Light-weight for storage* Expandability -- we added the two-panel expansion and it's the perfect size for our room, and even one parent.* Baby likes to lick it, so it must taste goodBad:* Takes a LOT of muscle to open and close. We'd hoped it would be a quicker, easier on-the-fly assembly. My wife can't do it.* Loud when open and close* Stable, but panels could be more rigid* No barbed-wire or electric voltage option",4
3821,"Totally worth the money as a generic. I thought it would have as much power as my AC adapter but it feels the same as the battery pack, so slightly less power. Better than constantly buying batteries though.",4
3822,"A must have for pumping moms...great gift idea.  Works just as well as normal plug, a little slower but better suction to it evens out the flow.",5
3823,"I love this! It saves a lot of batteries (I used to have to run my pump from the battery pack if we were away from home and in the car). If the batteries are running low you lose suction, but that doesn't happen if you have this! It helps a lot by making it easier to accomplish your nursing goals even while away from your home/comfort zone.",5
3824,"Works perfectly with my Pump In Style, allowing me to pump on car rides. I think it's slightly less powerful than the wall version that comes with the pump, but it gets the job done.",5
3825,"I use this daily. It does the job. I'm happy. Use it with my Medela PISA while I pump on the way to work.",5
3826,"This is great for me as I work long shifts and need to pump in the car before work to make the most of my time between pumping sessions. Fit perfectly with my medela pump in style advanced.",5
3827,"We got this seat for our youngest to graduate into from his infant carrier.  I love the steel frame, although that does make it heavy.  It folds closed for storage, which is great.  All the straps and covers are a bit elaborate but definitely workable, and it helps make the cover more removable for cleaning.  We have not had it in a crash, so I can't speak to that aspect.  Baby seems comfortable in it, currently weight 22 pounds and 32 inches long, rear facing.  It fastens easily and keeps baby very secure.  Love it.  Considering buying another one for the other car...",5
3828,"I really like these washcloths vs normal and child versions. I bought my first set in 2012 and bought these for a friends baby shower. My original set has held up over two years of use. Other child washcloths felt so rough and didn't retain warm water well when used to cover baby in baby tub.",5
3829,"These are really nice bibs. Good quality material. My only complaint is that they are bit on the small side. They don't come in different sizes so I assumed one size fits all, but I think they are bit tight around the neck for my daughter.",4
3830,"When shopping for bibs for bottle fed babies. I want ones that snap and are super soft and absorbent. That describes these perfectly!They are soft on my baby, who likes to rub her face into fabric. They are super absorbent, my baby spits up frequently due to reflux. And they snap, which makes it stay on better, especially now that she is 5+ months s and likes to pull and tug off the Velcro ones.I go through 6 - 10 bibs a day. The cheap ones don't hold up. They didn't last long. The Aden and Anais have earned their keep. Worth the investment, I will use them on the next baby.",5
3831,"I am not a big fan of this crib sheet.It is made of very thin material. You can see the writing on the mattress straight through. It also snags very easily on my nails.I would not purchase this product again.",2
3832,"This cover is pretty thick. I like that it covers the gusty wind or blockage from the sun. The only thing that I didn't like was that the back part is a tad bit short.",4
3833,"It's cheap, not a great umbrella stroller but it's not falling apart or unsafe.  It's not easy to close. Not really thrilled with it, but again, it was inexpensive, so I didnt expect much. I didn't have time to go to the store so I ordered online.",2
3834,"I have this night in our baby's nursery. It is great for late night feedings. I like it as a non-cord option rather than having a lamp. Plus once our little girl gets bigger she can carry it around. A great product for the price.",5
3835,"My little one was scared to sleep in her new twin bed instead of the crib. It was more open, just uncomfortable for her. I got her this light and suddenly she loves her big girl bed! She has &#34;Mr. Owl&#34; to make her feel safe and she can see her books as she reads herself to sleep. He's bright enough but not too bright, easy to carry, easy to push button... he is worth every penny! He shuts off automatically after 20 minutes so I don't have to worry about going back in her room later to turn him off. Simply fantastic!",5
3836,"LOVE this nightlight. It's the right size, not too big, very light weight and the handle is easy to hold. The button is small and on the bottom, so no accidentally turning it on while sleeping, but still easy to press and find in the dark. The 20 min. automatic timer option is also great, not too long, just right.It's bright enough, without being uncomfortable on the eyes. The price is low enough that I'm not worried about the little guy being too rough with it, (even though it is made very sturdy).It is a very simple, affordable, solution to night worriers.",5
3837,"Bought this and ended up returning it. It vibrated the entire crib when we turned it on. There was no way my baby would sleep through that racket!",1
3838,"I initially bought this because a friend recommended it to help put my baby to bed. But by the time we received it, my baby was already able to go to sleep on his own (with the help of his trusty mobile), so I didn't even bother opening this... thinking that I would just return it. However, my baby started getting night terrors and wake up crying in the middle of the night. It took a long time to get him to calm down (shooshing and patting). That's when I remembered that I still had this tucked away in an Amazon box. I broke it out of the box and tried it. It worked like a charm to put him back to sleep when he wakes at night and almost immediately settles him when he cries in his sleep.It's good that it turns off after 30 minutes, but I wish it had a setting that would turn it off after only 15 minutes, which is generally more than enough time for my baby to fall back completely asleep. With 30 minutes, the batteries run out very quickly, and the vibrating becomes less and less effective.",5
3839,"This is so petty I hate to type it however if someone else is looking for the same thing, I hope they stumble on this review. The picture of the nigh light does not have any writing on the front of it, even the packaging picture doesn't have any writing on it. The actual product says SAFETY 1st really large on the front!!!I kept the lights b/c I really needed them that day (moving into a new house) and didn't have time to send them back and go shop for something else. The actual light itself works well, totally lights up the bathroom. Just disappointed that the front isn't solid white.",3
3840,"Although, it's a little bright it's very safe in a babies room. Nothing really to break off of it to cause it to stop working.",5
3841,"This was purchased for a friend's baby shower.  It was a more reasonable price than Target.  The recipient was pleased with it.",5
3842,"Like this wipes holder it's not hard plastic it's a soft plastic so it doesn't crack very easily doesn't break easily and it stores well great item for the price",5
3843,"As others have mentioned in reviews, I wasn't able to loosen the straps at all, except by reaching back behind the car seat. That would especially prove tricky when the car seat is turned forward facing since the seat back wouldn't be accessible. As with most any carseat, pressing the release button should allow you to pull and loosen the straps from the front, but the straps just wouldn't budge until I tried pulling on the other end of the straps, way in the back.My husband was joking and giving me a hard time thinking it was user error, but he gave it a try and couldn't get them to loosen either.This common malfunction, and lack of quality control to catch it, makes me wonder what other ways the car seat might malfunction in a car accident. NOT WORTH THE WORRY OF SAFETY RISK.Also, the installation directions were pretty confusing. I'm sending it back and getting the Britax Marathon G4.",1
3844,"Excellent and better than expected. Our 19 month old is now experiencing luxury with this comfy car seat! I know we made the right choice in terms of safety, comfort, practicality, and size. Other peopels's reviews also helped tremendously in our decision process, so thank you, all! I have never felt this satisfied with [an important] baby product. Well worth it!",5
3845,"So comfy, easy to install and adjust. safe and easy to clean. If I ever have anot her baby I'll be buying this instead of a infant carseat.",5
3846,"This car seat is really great, lots of padding, but is large. I use it in a Ford Escape, and the front passenger seat is moved forward a fair distance. However, the baby seems very comfortable and it's worked well so far. Also, if you want to purchase an extra seat cover, you can call Maxi Cosi and order one.",4
3847,"I wanted to get my daughter a small backpack since she keeps trying to carry my heavy bags around. Now that she's walking, will more like running, I thought this would be great. She doesn't like to hold our hands if we let her walk with us so I thought this would help us keep her safe while letting her walk.",4
3848,"We will be taking a flight tomorrow with our 1.5 year old son. He's very active and likes to run around, so I figured I will get a harness backpack to give him some freedom while waiting at the airport. Looking at the offerings on amazon.com, this seems to have the highest review, so I ordered it. It's a really cute bag indeed. The backpack will allow me to put a couple soft toys and some snacks in for him to carry. The metal ring and hook for the harness will hopefully be sturdy and last a long time.The only thing that took off one star is the packaging. The bag is tied to a card board using zip ties. Fine I can cut those off like most products. However there's also a zip tie tying the metal ring and the harness hook together at the bottom of the backpack. It's so tight I swear I thought I was going to cut myself and head to the ER right before going on vacation! It's so tight the zip tie is a tiny ring, with no room to get a scissors' blade in to cut. It's really dangerous. I just wish the manufacturer can change this. It's really not necessary to make it so tight just to keep two parts together in a retail package.",4
3849,"This backpack is absolutely adorable!  My 15 month old daughter loves wearing this around the house (we hide the harness leash inside the backpack when not in use).  She loves being able to snap the buckles together, but she can't yet figure out how to unhook them thankfully.  We bought this for an upcoming trip and since she loves to run we figured this would come in handy at the airport.  The &#34;leash&#34; is short so depending how far you want your child to roam, a longer dog leash would do the trick.  I haven't tried to stuff too much into it yet, but it's pretty roomy (for a mini backpack) so I would say a couple books (small), a sippy cup, some snacks, and a toy or two would probably fit into it.",5
3850,"We bought this to protect our Inglesina fast table clip on chair that we use at the dining table, and also for going out and about. Our little one is only just sitting up on her own (she's 6 months) and the fabric is a little slick for her to sit with stability. I have ended up putting my purse behind her in the shopping cart, and also in restaurant high chairs. The pattern is cute and cheerful, it's very easy to remove and wash - and I love that it is &#34;space-consciencous&#34;.",4
3851,"This easily folds up so I keep it in the car and use it for any carts in the store or high chairs at restaurants. It gives me piece of mind to have those germs covered up (though be sure to wash the cover to get rid of germs too!). I can put it in the cart with one hand and baby has a soft place to sit. Great product!",5
3852,"This pump has it's pros and cons for me.Pros: It worked well. I got suction and expressed enough milk for my little one. I've been using it for about 5 1/2 months. I've ready stories how a mother has a hard time pumping for the first time, but with this pump it was easy for me. I like that you can adjust the settings. No it is not hands free, but alot of pumps aren't. It's small and lightweight which makes it very portable for the nursing mother. I like that it comes with a bag and accessories. It's a decent price compared to the professional ones. The quality was as expected. The breastshield/flanges are not for everyone, but worked just find for me without the petal inserts. It's a closed system, so no milk gets back into the tubing or motor. One big plus over Medela. It's easy to setup, clean, and sterilize.Cons. The bottles come unscrewed, so you have to be careful.  With the petal inserts (cushions), I couldn't get a good suction. It's loud. My baby didn't mind, but it's a little embarrassing when the loud noises come out of the nursing room at work. After 5 1/2 months, it just wouldn't turn on. I was upset because I needed to pump because I'm a working mother. So I had to go to a local supplier and rent one. I rented a Medela Symphony and it is superb. It's quieter and more effective. It cost me $3.00/per day and $75 for the accessories. Which my health care provider (tricare) won't reimburse. Under affordable care act, insurance companies will pay the cost to rent one (models may vary). Avent sent me out a new one with overnight shipping, but they don't send to APO address. So I had to have my mom forward to me which took a week and $30 shipping. So now I'm out about $125. I could have almost bought another pump at that price.",3
3853,"My milk didn't come in after a few weeks, so I had to return it, but this worked really well. If my milk had come in, it would have been my best friend for several months! My only complaint was that it was hard to get both sides suctioned and it was awkward to hold each side up for the whole pumping session. I've seen bras that hold them in place; Maybe if we have another kiddo someday we'll try that.  It really was almost as good as a hospital grade pump, though.",5
3854,"I bought this for my daughter. It is an excellent, comfortable, well designed pump.Easy to use and clean. Comes with a very nice case. Highly recommended.",5
3855,"I've tried a few, including the top brands but this is the best by far. Best part is the soft rubber instead of hard plastic. Loved it.",5
3856,"This is a pain to use.  I would save up gift cards, or make sure you put an electric pump on your registry.  This isn't going to get the job done for you.",1
3857,"Much better than a eletrical one I have from Mustela. Easy to use and very practical. I really recommend it!",5
3858,"This pump didn't make good suction for me. The most I got out of it was 20ml. Also, after about a week it started making loud squeaking noises. The only good thing I got out of it was the bottle. I wish I would have returned the pump but I didn't.",1
3859,"Manual suction is bigger than electric, easy to carry out, simple to use and convenient cleaningThere is no noise, I like it very much",5
3860,"This pump is a lot gentler on the nipples&#65292;several suction, free my hands, not cause mother hand, only lack of each battery cannot be used",5
3861,"Really neat design on the clip.  It adjusts for many different thicknesses of material easily.  The design of it is such that it won't break even though it's plastic - - it's not your typical live hinge that starts to get stressed out really quickly and snap.",5
3862,"My son has the turtle and monkey. He loves them both. He longer cares for the pacifier but he still holds onto them to take naps :)",5
3863,"My son loves his wubbanubs!",5
3864,"We have had this seat for almost a month now, we are very pleased and so is our 18 month old daughter.There are plenty of positive reviews so I am going to address some the negative reviews but also add my own perks; if you're anything like me, you read the 1-3 star reviews since all the 5 star just talk about how perfect it is. And who knows, you may not see this review since there are plenty of 5 stars already.CHAIR STRAPS: We did not have an issue with the straps being too long or with tightening them and we have small chairs. It does need to be tightened a certain way but it definitely feels more secure than the traditional &#34;pull to tighten&#34; like you would on the waist straps and they definitely will NOT come loose. Love that! It also sits nicely on our IKEA padded seats. You'd be surprised how many boosters out there are not padded seat friendly.WAIST STRAPS: These are easy enough and they do allow for some movement. Could she get out? No, but they are secure and the day she learns to unbuckle herself, we probably won't use them anyway. It's a booster seat. It is meant to teach them the beginnings of sitting at the table, not restrain, so yes, you're kid is going to be able to move around a bit.CLEANING: Love, love, LOVE how easy this is to clean. Wipe and go. And guess what? If it fades, it doesn't effect the overall use of the seat.PORTABILITY: Sure, it's a little bulky but when you're only carrying it to and from the car and your destination it beats a LOT of those other boosters out there. We wanted a plain and simple since piece seat. Who wants to take things apart and fold it back up? Lightweight, grab and go. Done.Did I leave anything out? I don't think so but if I did, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for somewhere in the other reviews. Happy hunting! :)",5
3865,"I LOVE this stool! It's so, so sturdy. Will not tip over, even if an adult puts all weight on just one side. It's light and easy to move. It could be a tiny bit taller, but that will obviously be less important as my daughter grows taller.",5
3866,"Love this stool! Went through three others prior to finding this one and they were all too short. Finally my daughter can reach the sink to wash her hands!",5
3867,"My son loves this stool. Right now he uses it to get up on our bed. But it very light weight so he can pick it up and take it elsewhere. He likes to move it up to the window to stare out the window. He started using this around 18 months and he is now two. It grips well, and is very sturdy. I never have to worry about it being wobbly. It doesn't take up too much room either. Now, I need to get a second on for the bathroom.",5
3868,"My son loves to use this while brushing his teeth or getting on the toilet. It definitely will not support the weight of an adult so if that's what you are looking for look elsewhere.",5
3869,"built solidLightweight so kids can carry itWONT TIP OVERpriced welladorable lookingdoes not tip over, even if you stand all the way on one edgeWhat more can you ask for in a stool?Great product.",5
3870,"This is so cute&#8230; we already lost 3 of the hankies that come with it but thats ok.  You can really get creative using the whale as a peekaboo toy.  We've used washcloths since we lost the hankies (I'm sure they'll turn up eventually).",4
3871,"These are expensive and a little bulky, as others have pointed out, but my daughter loves them! (I also made a big deal of them being 'super' undies!) She has been daytime potty trained for over 2 years now but sleeps so heavily through the night we have not been able to night train well. Now she is outgrowing the pull ups and instead of continuing to buy expensive disposables we figured we would give this a try... So far, so good. No leaks last night!",5
3872,"I love this! I don't use it a whole lot since I breastfeed but my husband uses it to warm up pumped milk if I am away. I use it to wsrm homemade baby food and sanitize binkies and it does the job. I really like that it is neutral and doesbt scream &#34;baby product!&#34; on our counter",5
3873,"Easy to use and fast, which is just what you want when you've got a hungry baby. I used it to warm up my pumped breast milk. My Avent bottles fit perfectly in it. Definitely recommend!",5
3874,"This is the perfect little potty. My daughter took to it immediately. It's the perfect height (she's 2 years old) and depth. It's very easy to empty, clean and move around as needed. It's helped her excel very quickly at potty training, since we can keep it in the play room, bring it outside and even put it in the trunk of my SUV so that she can go easily whenever she needs to.",5
3875,"Simple.  Nothing fancy about it, works as expected.  Easy to clean.  Easy for my 22 month old to use (when he wants to).  The only thing I don't like is that the bucket easily lifts from the potty... because that is all my son want to do is take the bucket out.  I wish there was some kind of latch or child proofing, but I'm not surprised there isn't on a $10 potty.",4
3876,"If you are comparing this to the Baby Bjorn potty, there is no reason to purchase it at 3x the price. This is pretty much an identical product, and more attractive colors and lines/edges in my opinion.",4
3877,"The splash guard is a bit high and it makes it difficult for my daughter to sit comfortably on it. Wide seat. I wasnt thrilled. Very basic. Not really good for a girls first potty.",3
3878,"This potty seat has been working great for my 2.5 year old.  At big chain stores I was having a hard time finding an inexpensive option that didn't play songs etc.  This was exactly what I needed!",5
3879,"love this because it is all white and super simple looking! no bright colored cartoon crap.  we can wipe it off or rinse it, whatever and its a steal of a price",5
3880,"I love that it has grips on the bottom to avoid the potty sliding around. The built in pee guard is a good height to avoid any overshooting. the basin is deep. The potty is easy to clean. It is a little bit bigger than my other potty which is fine with my. With twins I needed a second potty to avoid accidents. Good price for great quality.",5
3881,"we use this one in our downstairs 1/5 bath, she has yet to master the potty but she likes it. easy to clean",4
3882,"These are great nursing pads.  I had used disposables for my first daughter, but was grossed out by them when I smelled the smell of sour milk on her breath one morning.  I had to change those pads so often that I was throwing money out the window buying them.  These pads never smell and are so easily thrown into the wash to be used again and again.  They have held up extremely well for the last 4 weeks with our newborn daughter.  I produce a lot of milk and leak quite a bit at night, so there have been a few times where I have leaked down the sides of them and have woken up with a wet top, but I do not blame the pads.  No other leaking issues with them at all.",5
3883,"When backwards facing it looks wrong but isnt. Childs legs are all up on the back of the seat with it fully reclinded. It looks cramped to me but my daughter has adjusted.",4
3884,"We have three of this car seat, two in my truck for my toddler and nine month old, and one in my husband's truck. We love them.We haven't had any strap issues like in some negative reviews. The straps are easy for us to adjust whether they're wearing light t-shirts or heavy winter parkas. We also haven't had any issues with the straps being too short.These car seats fit great in our vehicles both rear and forward facing. That being said, both my husband and I drive large vehicles. I can't speak to how they may fit in a car or small SUV. I can use one rear facing, one forward facing and still have room for a middle schooler across the middle row of my vehicle.",5
3885,"I wanted a diaper bad that I could also use for my things as well that wasn't to big and would match with anything. This bag is perfect. I'm constantly on the go and it has held up great!",5
3886,"This is pretty cute, easy to stuff (and overstuff) and still get on my arm. It's a great value for the price, because diaper bags are ridiculously priced in my opinion. My only wish is that it didn't feel SO polyester-ish on the inside. The inside pockets feel like they will rip open if I'm not gentle with them. Also the changing pad is unnecessary. It's not really big enough for babies bigger than a newborn (unless you just put it under the diaper area, but I like to put my whole baby on the changing pad).",4
3887,"We received this as a gift and were skeptical about it at first. However, it turns out that it makes it easy and fun to prepare food for the baby. No, you don't NEED it - you can steam food in a steamer and then use a blender to puree it, but the Beaba is a nice convenience. It's fast, you can set it to steam and leave it, and clean-up is simple. We use it quite frequently and have never had any problems with it.Would be nice if there was an option to turn off the timer beep for when baby is asleep. Blender isn't quiet, but probably quieter than a normal blender. Our baby did seem to enjoy the taste of food made at home in the Beaba more than canned food, and it is cheaper to make food rather than buy it.",5
3888,"Seriously, the best baby invention ever! So easy to use! You just cut up the food, pour in the water and the machines steams it for you. Most fruits tak 15 minutes and most veggies take 20 minutes to cook. Once cooked, you just poor them out and blend them up. Best tasting baby food and you know exactly what's in it! I've made peach, sweet potato, carrot, green beans, mango, apple, and I know the list is endless!If I could buy this for every new mom I would. Great investment!",5
3889,"I bought this product because of the reviews, but was quite unimpressed with it. It's definitely for cold weather, as it is extremely warm and you and your child will sweat a lot while breastfeeding.",2
3890,"I'm average height, and this does NOT hang as long on me as it does on the model pictured. Still, it works well, and I've gotten compliments after only one use. Truthfully, it would be SUPER easy to make, but I'm not crafty, so it was worth the purchase for me. I feel confident that no one can see anything they shouldn't, but I'd like it better if the material was a bit lighter. It's thick and heavy, which isn't super convenient for portability or for the hot summer. I DO love that it goes all the way around unlike most nursing covers that only hang in front and don't hide much. I'll keep it, but I might ask my mom to MAKE me a second one that's longer and made of lighter material.",4
3891,"I bought this for a trip we were taking and since we would be flying/taking trains/being in restaurants, I thought I needed a good cover to breastfeed my daughter. Unfortunately, this cover ended up being more a nuisance than it being useful.As the picture shows, one side is totally closed and the other side is open. With my daughter underneath, she seemed to feel a bit cramped and would easily pull the &#34;closed&#34; side over her head, thus making the cover pointless. When she was ready to change sides, I had to turn the whole cover around, this was a bit difficult with a moving child.My other dislikes were the fact that the material was quite heavy and my daughter would become very hot, very quickly. (We were in Paris in the early spring which is not a particularly warm place to be.) In the end, I ended up just using my thin scarf as a cover and using the cover as a scarf.With that being said, my daughter was 9 months at the time and was not used to being covered while breastfeeding. So perhaps this would be a great cover for someone with a small baby (who doesn't move much) and who is used to having a cover :-)",3
3892,"I ended up using this when I was at home but it looked too frumpy to wear out.  Made me look even bigger than I was after I have birth.  Not worth the price.",1
3893,"3.5 year old doesn't mess with these too much, they are sturdy, fit the variety of doorknobs within our house, and you can reach the unlocking mechanism even with it on.  Plus they are relatively inexpensive!",4
3894,"I received the Rock 'N Play when my daughter was born, and I was worried that we didn't really need it. It became one of my favorite items though! On nights when she was spitting up bad I would put her in the rock n play because it was inclined. I think it was soothing to her as well because it held her. I used it every single day. If I had to put her down I just put her in the rock n play. It is very lightweight, so I could easily carry it from room to room. It is also very easy to clean, just throw the pads in the washing machine. Definitely one of my favorite baby products!! When we would travel out of town we took it instead of a bulky, heavy pack n play, and it was wonderful.",5
3895,"This monitor works, but it would not be the first one I recommended.  The range is ok, but it will from time to time go out of range when it is sitting still.  The nighttime image is not great, but it is adequate.  The zoom feature is the same. The audio is decent on this as you can have a conversation with someone from another room. Overall this monitor does its job, but does not excel much.",3
3896,"The volume control stopped working... It will go down, but not up, so I can't hear my baby. I've only had this a few months. So, basically, I wake up every few hours to check on him. I get less sleep than before.",2
3897,"I was sick of the suction cup holder type toy holders always falling off the wall, so I was excited to find this cute pelican! Excited until we used it. The mesh does not stay in place (falls out when we try to get the toys out) and it is way to big for our normal size tub (The picture lis very misleading in showing the mesh not touching the ground)So bummed this didn't work, I would return it had I not already thrown out the box!",1
3898,"This is my second baby jogger stroller. I also own the baby jogger city mini. I love both strollers for different reasons.The City Mini is my everyday stroller as this is way to heavy and big to go shopping with. If you want an everyday stroller for the stores get something else. This stroller is made for the outdoors.This is a great stroller for those who do not wish to pay more for the BOB. It is very similar but has on big difference. This stroller lets you lock the wheel remotely. Such an improvement. I love the big seat for my little one, and the hand brake. This is a breeze to push. My husband and I both can run with this stroller. I am 5'2&#34; and he is 6'. He stated it felt like running on a treadmill. He didn't even notice he was pushing anything, he just noticed he was hanging on to something.While I really love this stroller it is missing a few things. The hand brake gets in the way when you are walking, and is in a fixed location. It would be nice if you could move this to another position. Also,  this baby is HEAVY. Yes the one handed fold is great but this thing is so heavy i would never take it in a car unless I had too. It would be nice if this came with a belly bar or cup holder. For the price it should! I wish it had an adjustable handle but if you really need this by the newer (AKA pricier) model. Overall I would buy this again but hopefully baby jogger fixes some of the issues in the new models.",4
3899,"My husband installed this on our toilet. It makes cleaning out the diapers so much easier! It has great water pressure from our line which gets a lot of residue off, but can also cause some overspray while rinsing, you just have to be careful. And it does &#34;leak&#34; a little, meaning that there is residual water in the head after you're done spraying that can drip out if its at a certain angle. We just keep a little cloth on the floor. But we haven't had any leaking from where it connects to the line.",5
3900,"Hooked this up in five minutes. No tools required. Some people complained about water pressure but I just adjusted the flow on the intake until it sprayed just as hard as I needed but not so much that it splatters everywhere. So happy with this purchase after a month!",5
3901,"My husband installed this, and it seems to be fine. Unfortunately, though, you have to shut off the valve VERY tightly when not using it, otherwise it leaks.",4
3902,"Works great! Its the only one I've used so I can't compare it to anything else but it does the trick and has great pressure.",5
3903,"Saw this listed on Consumer Reports listed I think #1. a little trickier to set up when rearfacing and our older car that doesn't have the latch system. didn't think I also would car about the cup holders - but they are actually kinda nice to put toys drink, stuff in.",4
3904,"I was having a problem with my bottles looking greasy after multiple uses.  I could not even get them McLean in the dish washer.  I found this and problem solved.  I fill the sink and let them soak for a while.  Then brush them out.  No more problems.",4
3905,"This does an okay job of removing breast milk from bottles. I can see a difference when i use this vs when i use the dishwasher. That being said my bottles are still turning a milky yellow after only 9 months.",3
3906,"The product recommends soaking your bottles in it, then putting them up to dry.  I don't use it in that way at all.  I use it in my water, but treat it like a soap.  I still use a brush, and I also rinse.  It's been the only soap to effectively clean the breast milk grease off of my bottle nipples.",4
3907,"I use this everyday at the office to clean my pumping parts. I soak the parts in it and then rinse them off after each use.  It's so convenient because I don't have to worry about brushes, etc.",5
3908,"Very happy with this carrier.  Fits our car seat nicely.  I assembled by myself by pushing the pieces into place (no outside tools needed).  Easy and fast in just a few minutes!  It's not a top of the line carrier, but I found maneuverability and smoothness very good for such a low price (although probably not as good as top of the line and much more expensive strollers).  Light enough for me, my mother, and my MIL which was a huge consideration since I am an older mom and both grandmothers are elderly (70s+).  Satisfying the three of us is not easy!  Definitely recommended!",5
3909,"Only reason for 4 start review instead of 5 is that it is not fully compatible with the Britax B-safe.  Another reviewer mentioned using the combo together so we bought it for a trip instead of taking our large bob stroller.  You can use with the B-safe.  However, you are not using the &#34;clic&#34; in part of the seat, you are only using the secondary strap in system.  You must tighten this strap down to make sure the seat doesn't move.  However, instead of 2 ways to lock the seat into place you are now using just the red back up strap.  Seemed to work fine.  Just an FYI for others with Britax.  It is not a brand specified on the box as compatible when it was received.",4
3910,"I have been using this for several months now since my son was less than a year old.  Yes, it is tight as some review state, but that is what makes it work.  Plus, you only have it on their head long enough to rinse the shampoo off and then you take it off.  My son tolerates it just fine long enough for me to accomplish the task it was designed for.  No water in his eyes or ears either.",5
3911,"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first, but thought I'd give it chance after reading the positive reviews, and I'm glad I did. The visor arrived super fast, FIT PERFECTLY, and worked as described. My two-year old hates when it's time to wash her hair because she doesn't like water on her face. This visor has already made bath time SO much easier!",5
3912,"I like this seat a lot, but we have had trouble getting it into the &#34;1&#34; position for infants.  We will have to use a pool noodle to get it there.",4
3913,"It does its job but run super small for my 4 months old baby. Is a great idea for babies with flat spots",3
3914,"I can't vouch for this. Maybe it helps as a preventative measure, but it did not help with correcting the problem. My son's head is just barely lopsided too. Not bad enough for a helmet, but enough for me to like to fix it through mild measures if possible.",3
3915,"Tray locking mechanism and end broke within 2 weeks or so of using. Was able to exchange with Amazon. Otherwise happy and easy to use, keep clean etc. Will continue to use.",3
3916,"I use these to make Popsicles for my daughter (I started when she was about 7 months).  I think the frozen concoctions help when she's teething.  The reason I give it 3 stars, though, is because when she gets down to the plastic part, there are little circle cut outs that she chews on and have caused her gums to bleed.  She doesn't have any teeth yet, so maybe it won't happen once she gets a few.",3
3917,"I purchased this for my one-year old to make smaller sized healthy fruit pops, but my 2 year old loves this as well! I blended up some cantaloupe and poured it into the molds and my toddler at 3 in one sitting and 1 year old nibbled on the other. the handle is the perfect shape for little ones and it is not too big/cumbersome for them to hold/eat. the popsicles easily come out of the mold, unlike others we have tried before.",5
3918,"It works as it should.The image is good to do a quick check on baby. There is one step zoom.The commands are a little trick to understand initially but no problem after all.Intercom works fine with clean sound.the chargers are identified for the camera and the screen.",4
3919,"Who knows if these necklaces actually do what they say they do. But I will say that since giving it to my LO after a rough bout of teething one weekend, she doesn't seem to complain about her gums hurting anymore. Whether that's the necklace or not, I'll never know. The necklace is perfectly knotted before and after each stone, and it seems pretty well put together. The stones are lovely, and all the shades of amber that I was hoping for.",5
3920,"It seems to work for us. My son has had 2 teeth pop up without us even noticing. So I don't know if he's a good teether or what. I have noticed that he fusses a little when it's not on. I love the multicolored beads. He wears it all the time and it's super lightweight.",4
3921,"I've heard great things about these from many people, since my first child was born. So, when my second baby starting teething, I thought I would try it out. He wore it with no discernable difference for about 2 hours, and then he began the most inconsolable screaming crying fit I've ever heard--he had never cried like that before, and is normally a very calm, happy baby. I took the necklace off after about ten minutes and he calmed down almost immediately. I put it back on him the next day, thinking it must have been a fluke, and the same thing happened again! I googled my experience, and apparently I'm not the only one whose baby had a negative reaction to the necklace. Still, thinking maybe it was a coincidence, I kept it off him for a week, to see if he was just being irritable for a couple of days, and he didn't cry like that once. I put it back on (for the last time) and again, horrible crying fits. I don't know if he just didn't wearing it, or he had a reaction to the baltic amber, but it sure makes things worse for him. Pity, I had very high hopes for this necklace. However, my two and a half year old LOVES it and wears it all the time, so it's still getting use I suppose. It's a very cute necklace!",3
3922,"My son is a serious flailer and strong so when he outgrew the SwaddleMe Velcro sacs I bought the Woombie. He's a big baby so maybe I should've gone a size up, but honestly he can still move around. I love the concept, but he hates it, lol. He just screams until you take it off... I'm going to try again but I don't have much hope. As some have said, diaper changes in this thing are amazing and there is no escaping, so when he sleeps in it he sleeps beautifully. The problem is getting him to sleep in it--4/10 times he just won't. My only design complaint is the mesh. It's very rigid and when my son sleeps in his swing it bunches under his chin which is very uncomfortable for him. If the mesh were softer and the zipper were covered in fabric, it'd get much more use from me :)",4
3923,"There are much better swaddle options out there! While the zippered front makes placing a baby in the swaddle easy the confining nature and zipper were not comfy for our little one.  Use of similar velcro swaddles found to be of much better utility for our needs given you can vary the confinement level based on the technique used.  Would not recommend this particular product.",2
3924,"This hamper is actually much larger than I had expected.  I have two girls and it works perfect for us.",5
3925,"We previously bought a ten buck pop up laundry basket for our son but it has fallen apart in the last year.  This hamper is well constructed and even though it was more than twice the amount, I am sure it will hold up for much, much longer.  The handle design is very clever and it is easy to carry when full and very cute in our son's room.  I wish the laundry hamper came in more animal designs from the 3 Sprouts line because I would order a second one, but I don't care for the other characters.  This would also be cute as a toy basket for a play room.",5
3926,"So cute in my son's nursery and the handles are terrific. A little when he gets older but perfect for now.",5
3927,"We loved this play yard as a bassinet! It was so convenient and looks nice too. Until we stared using it as a play yard since baby reached the recommended weight limit. The issue is that the floor surface of the play yard is very uneven. She is definitely not comfortable laying in it! The center foot created a bump in the center. To try and solve the issue I added a couple thick quilts, which made the surface a bit more even, but still the problem remains. Sadly, this is the main reason why I purchased this play yard, but now we really can't use it as planned.I would recommend getting a play yard with a floor that sits directly ON the floor to avoid this problem.",3
3928,"I am a totally disenchanted fan of cloth diapering. I do it because its smart, but the prices just kill me. I have done the absolute cheapest (prefolds-covers, all kinds of covers) and I have done the most expensive aio's and now I don't care how good the words sound in the ads, I gotta see it to believe it.  I had planned to buy the best bottom system, but the trial cover I ordered, I did not like. So I ordered a button cover hardly daring to hope it would be better, only it was! I ordered 8 more covers for my baby girl due in aug and my 22 month old son to share. I love how stretchy they are, how they gently swoop down in the front allowing them to sit comfortably under the belly, how the double gussets hold everything in securely, how the crotch area is just a little more narrow, making the diaper to be so much more trim, how the snaps are crossover snaps for a very small baby, how simply they are made without a lot of fuss and things that can go wrong, and how obnoxiously adorable the little button detail is on my sons little diapered bottom, and the price, oh the wonderful affordable price!. Yes indeed, I am a buttons fan! Thankyou husband and wife team, for making cloth diapering simple and easy again.",5
3929,"Easy for my 7mo old baby to hold and teeth on. Safe for baby! Cute design and easy to clean.",4

3931,"When I first put this on, I wasn't sure if I would like it because it covers such a wide area.  But I can see my little guy so well while he is sitting behind me, and he can see me.  I can still see out of my windows, and can actually see more of traffic.  It's a little more than I was looking to spend, but I have no complaints.  It doesn't wobble and your view isn't distorted at all.  I would definitely recommend it!",4
3932,"I got tired of taking my spoon in a plastic bag, and this is a great solution.I also love this spoon. I tried it myself and it feels very soft and smooth on the lips.",5
3933,"I like these. Don't like plastic handle, steel makes spoon very hard and it's pretty thick. Not the best for scraping bowls. Rounded edges so so soft on face. Holds right amount of food easily, nice color. Cannot beat the case tho. Snaps tight, very convenient. Tip is silicone so better than other travel options, great great price.",4
3934,"I loved the OXO spoons on their own, but this one with the case is a necessity for anyone needed to feed a baby outside their home.  Keeps a clean spoon clean and a dirty spoon from getting everything else dirty.",5

3938,"I pondered over if I should get this or not for the price for months.  I wished I had bought it sooner.  It worked out so great when we went out to eat I could throw it in the diaper bag or my purse.",5
3939,"I use these combined with my newborn sized prefolds, I just put them in the middle and then fold the prefold around the insert and put that in my cover, no stuffing. It works great!",5
3940,"I ordered these then ordered them again once baby was born and in cloth diapers because we loved them and wanted more. We double stuff our diapers and adding these to our stash works great! every diapers gets one of these and one microfiber. They are absorbent and easy to clean. She's 4 months and no stains yet. They've also held up well in the wash. And finally the size is great! These do take longer to air dry than other liners but I think its just because they are more absorbent.",5
3941,"I use these alone in my fuzzibunz one size (elite and before elite) they work great for my toddler but are too long for my four month old. They absorb well while staying trim and wash with no stink left behind, first I reach for when changing my two year old.",4
3942,"These inserts have worked ok for our econobum diapers.  They are a little on the smaller side for our newborn setting on the diaper, so I will have to give them another try once our baby is bigger (she was 8lbs at birth four weeks ago).  Because they are so compact, we had a few blow outs at the legs of the covers, but that may just be because of the cover:insert size on a newborn.  Also, they don't come clean like the other cotton inserts or the AIO diapers, and after the very first time washing them, they linted up with little lint balls covering them.  I have nursing pads made of bamboo that do not lint up at all, so I am not sure of what the difference would be.  It's not a big issue, but they haven't earned 5 stars as of yet.",3
3943,"I replaced all my microfiber with bamboo and couldn't be happier. My 6 month old isn't a heavy wetter (not that I have any other babies to compare him to, just never have had an issue with leaking), so I just use one insert during the day and change every 2-3 hours. For naps I use 2 inserts, and overnights I use Best Bottoms hemp overnight inserts and covers just as a precaution because I suspect 2 bamboo inserts in a pocket would do just fine. I've accidentally left a diaper on with just one insert for a nap, and my baby can nap 3+ hours, and it was completely saturated but no leaks. I also love using natural fibers. I used to do a sniff test on all my microfiber before I put it in the dryer but now I don't even worry about that and just throw them in. If I ever need more absorbency as my child gets older I definitely plan on purchasing another set.",5

I have an Acura SUV and it wiped out my blind spot totally, and the passenger front seat had to be moved all the way up (preventing anyone from sitting there) in order to accommodate this seat at the proper recline.  The material is foam, which in the midwest and warm humid summers would lead to disaster and overheating.  I placed my girl in the seat, and with the proper recline (based on bubble level installed in the carseat), she seemed too much in the laying position, and kept trying to get up or out.Being so HUGE, I had no blind spot and that would be dangerous driving, I returned the seat.",2
3946,"We have the Recaro Proride, Peg Perego in our cars.  We needed a seat that I could get into my nanny's car quickly before dashing to work.  I bought this based on the quick install feature and high reviews, and it's actually my favorite of the 3.  Why don't all car seats have the bubble leveler?  Takes the guess work out of your BABY'S SAFETY.  No head flopping forward when baby falls asleep!  The multiple recline levels means no rolled towels or pool noodles for this busy mama.  I can get this into my nanny's Civic in 5 minutes with a rock solid installation.  I had good luck with the shoulder straps.  Got the newer version.  AND, I bought it during a sale promotion AND got an additional rebate through ebates.  The Recaro is so tall that I have to be extremely careful when I merge in traffic since I can't see over the seat. Multiple near accidents.  No problem at all with the Nextfit.  I have no complaints. Others may find issue with the fact this seat is heavier than most, but I didn't think it was a problem for me.  I know that there's a newer model where you can zip out the fabric to wash.  I don't know if it's worth the extra $75.",5
3947,"I ordered the Liteway Plus in anticipation of a plane trip where I needed both a stroller and car seat at my destination. I wanted to gate check the stroller and the guidelines require an umbrella stroller. I also thought that since it's a two in one that I would be pleased to use this in toddler mode in a few months.I actually ordered this from BBB with a 20% off coupon and free shipping. It took a few extra days to ship, but arrived two days before my trip. The stroller was easy to assemble/convert to frame mode. However, when I clicked in the Keyfit 30, the left side did not click. I called Chicco and they asked me to send in pictures of the car seat and stroller to assess the warranty. Forget that. Satisfaction guaranteed at BBB so I just returned it instead. My car seat clicks into the base every time and clicks into the Chico Keyfit Caddy every time.The Liteway Plus was also too heavy for my liking at about 20 lbs. It does not stand when folded and does not have adjustable handles. For the price and weight, these should be features.We'll stick to the Caddy until Baby can use a traditional umbrella stroller, and choose an umbrella stroller that is lighter weight. For the price of the Liteway Plus, you can get the Caddy and an umbrella like the First Years Ignite.",3
3948,"We took this stroller to Asia. It is very bulky to place it anywhere in the restaurant. It is heavy and hard to fold, must use both hands to close or the stroller will fall onto the ground. Many times I forgot I had something in the basket. Once I folded the stroller, everything slided out onto the floor.I start to envy other's strollers which are easy to close and light weight. It is very cozy for the baby and it has a lot of cup holders. But it is not the stroller you want to travel with.",3
3949,"I was so pleased with these Alvas.  They fit my daughter great!  She was a big girl at birth, and I waited until she was a month old before I started them....she was 10+ lbs and wears them on the smallest setting.  They are the best fitting brand of my stash....and the cheapest!  Love it! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't get the diapers pictured, a few were different.  Still cute and super soft, but different.  These are also fuzzy...I really like that.",4
3950,"We read through hours of reviews for several car seats and were happy we bought this one. Our little one ended up coming home at 5 1/2 lbs and 20 inches long so we needed one that would support a tiny baby and grow with him. We've had him for 4 months, and he's 15 lbs and 25 inches, and there's still a lot more room for this kiddo to grow. We love that it connects so well with the jogger as well. Great system!",5
3951,"I ordered this stroller for my daughter.  I am always worried about an &#34;assembly required&#34; product, but my husband put it together quickly and easily.  My daughter has used it for several weeks and does not have any complaints.  Her suggestions would be to secure the cover in 2 or more places, otherwise it flies back as she is running whenever she hits a bump, since it only has one connection, also her iphone does not fit in the tray, its too big.  I would definitely recommend this stroller to others.",4
3952,"As a first time mom, I was set on purchasing one stroller that would take my baby from newborn to toddler.  I was drawn to the Graco Click Connect system, and chose this jogger.  It is a very well built and sturdy stroller, with some nice details.  The cup holders and phone spot are great, as is the roomy basket underneath.  The shade folds down and really protects your child from the elements and sun (especially in combo with the canopy of the car seat.  It is so easy to fold with the FastAction system, and the Click Connect system is amazing when you are using the car seat - so fast!However, the stroller is very heavy (30 pounds!), and in conjunction with the car seat, it weighs even more.  That's a lot of weight to haul in and out of the car, as well as push around.  It is also a very large stroller - I must admit I felt kind of ridiculous pushing my 8 pound 1 month old around in this monster of a stroller.  I finally caved and bought a car seat frame to use until he grew into the stroller to use without the car seat, and could not get over how simple, light, and portable the frame was compared to this stroller.The last straw for me was when I purchased a new car that had slightly less room in the trunk than my last one.  The stroller barely fit! Yes, it folds up, but it is still very large and bulky.If you purchase this, make sure you purchase a tyre pump as well, and check your tires before you go out.  I bought a portable one to keep in the diaper bag in case anything happened on a walk or day out.",3
3953,"My son might be 5 1/2, but he is special needs with low muscle tone, so a stroller is a must since he doesn't walk far very fast. And now that summer is fast approaching, we're getting back outside.  Which means, all of this made me incredibly excited to try the new Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller!We love to take walks through the state parks and a jogging stroller has increased maneuverability!  LOVE this!!  The bigger, air-filled wheels roll over uneven ground easier than small, hard plastic wheels.  And with the roomy storage compartment below, I can put all our needs for a day out in it - a cooler packed with food,  diaper bag, extra water bottles, and a blanket.  It features extra deep cup holders up top for Mom, so I don't have to reach down into the under-carriage compartment for my water bottle.  And a place for Mom's smartphone or MP3 player, with a little enclosed storage compartment underneath!I love the sun shade on this stroller, as the sides are see-through, so my son can see more than just straight ahead as we walk (or jog!) along.  Reclining seat positions makes it easy for if he decides to take a nap!  I can even put the seat in a reclined position and change my son's diaper right in the stroller!Other reasons to love the Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller:Since it rolls smoother over rough surfaces, this means I can go faster!  I'm not a jogger, but I do like to walk at a good fast pace.  The handle bar is a little higher on this one vs. the old one I had, so that combined the faster action means a better workout for my legs and I'm already feeling it!Our other stroller, since I bought it used, was already assembled.  This one really was easy to assemble - just a few parts to snap in.  I had to have my husband put the kickstand in though, I couldn't manage to get that snapped in place.Speaking of the kickstand, what a great feature!!  Now I can set the stroller up against the wall when not in use instead of having this big thing on the floor to trip over.The front wheel can either be locked in place, or swivel.  The manual recommends locking it in place for rough surfaces such as grass or gravel, but I found it was easier for me to leave it on swivel all the time.This stroller is also easier to push one-handed vs. my old one, which is a definite plus when the dog accompanies us on our walks.It has a nice little strap/handle for pulling the stroller into the closed position.  It's also nice to use when pulling the closed stroller behind or next to me when putting it away.Same as the old stroller, I don't always use it as a 5 pt harness, so when the shoulder straps are not in use, I just flip them up over the back and out of the way.Now, we don't have an infant, but should one come along, I plan to purchase another Graco infant carseat, which will fit right into this stroller.  Any Graco Click Connect Infant Car Seat will work with this stroller!  The Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller also fits children up to 50lbs, so it will be a long time before my son outgrows this stroller.And I'll admit it - when I took the Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller out for its maiden voyage, I loved it SO MUCH I immediately gave away our old Travel System stroller to a new home. ;-)Reviewed by Anne for New Age Mama. Complimentary product received.",5
3954,"Nice features, and goes pretty much anywhere! I wish the shade went down more, but everything else outweighs that for the money!",5
3955,"We bought this mainly to use as our in-room bassinet since our room is so small and we didn't want a full sized pack-n-play. It blends in nicely with our decor, and doesn't take up much space. The side netting is nice to keep baby cool, as is the canopy for keeping any residual light out of baby's eyes. It's easy to move around, and easy to pack up.As compared to the Arms-Reach cosleeper, we chose this because it was more affordable and had more versatility because it converts to a bed for toddlers. The only thing the cosleeper has over this (in my opinion) is the drop front. However that wasn't a big deal for us, and definitely not worth the extra money the arms-reach costs.I will say that, though our baby slept in this for a few weeks, she has refused to sleep in it for the past month. I think it's because we didn't buy the mattress for it and the included sleeping pad isn't that soft (she seems to prefer the softer crib mattress). That is why I dropped a star. In it's as sold condition (without spending the additional money on the foam mattress), it is good but not great.Two notes:1) If you don't buy the mattress, you can use a standard pillowcase to cover up the included sleeping pad instead of buying a special fitted sheet.2) I bought mine on diapers.com and it ended up being around $80 with free shipping. They usually have deals for new customers that make it a bit cheaper.Overall I would still buy this over an arms-reach cosleeper or other bassinet, simply for the versatility and size.",4
3956,"This was the one thing I ordered before baby arrived that was a true &#34;splurge&#34; for us. Yes we could get by without it but it has made life so much easier. I unexpectedly had to have a c-section so having the baby bedside in the bassinet for feedings after recovery was super helpful. The quality of the bassinet is better than others I have seen in stores and we like that you can lift out the carrier and move the stand where ever you want. I put a waterproof cloth (intended to put on the top of changing pad covers) in the bassinet to make cleanup easy. We haven't used the pack in play as much but we have it in the family room for quick diaper changes. We plan on using it more for when baby gets bigger and for when we go out of town. We expect the set to last us for future babies. One thing to note, it did take us a while to put the pack and play together (aprox. 20-30 min) at times some of the instructions were confusing. Make sure you take your time and really look things over.",5
3957,"I love the Rittenhouse line, we have the stroller and car seat as well, I love the ease of removing the lining to wash, thus far although it's for my son...my granddaughter has been putting it to good use and I have no complaints, works great!",5
3958,"When my wife and I registered for our baby, we didn't put a highchair on our registry because it was something we didn't need. However, 3.5 months later, we realized we probably would need to start looking around.  We had a gift card for our local Babies R Us and decided to see what kind of selection they had.  Out of the 20 or so high chairs, this one was one that appealed most to us.  It looked nice, had great functions listed, and would grow as our baby grows.  The color we originally wanted was Oasis, but anyone who has shopped at Babies R Us/Toys R Us can tell you that the markup on their items is a bit more than other places.  We decided to wait to shop around.Then a couple weeks later, Amazon had SAME highchair on a Lightning Deal but in the Metropolis color (black & gray).  We decided that for $50 cheaper than Babies R Us, it was worth purchasing despite being a different color.  After a few weeks of ownership, my wife and I couldn't be happier.From beginning to end, putting this highchair together requires NO TOOLS and only took me about 15-20 minutes to put together.  Our infant (she's a little over 3 months old, was born a preemie) LOVES LOVES this seat.  For some reason after she eats, she likes sitting up and doesn't like being laid back down.  The problem is, she tends to feed right before our dinner time.  What this allows us to do as parents is actually EAT & ENJOY our meal while our daughter is right next to us.  I can't tell you how many times before we got this chair that one of us had to hold her while the other eats their dinner at our dinner table.  Then when that person is done, the person holding her (usually me) ends up eating a cold dinner.  This chair solved all our problems.It's important to note that this chair is a 3-in-1, rather than a 4-in-1.  The difference between 3-in-1 highchair systems and 4-in-1s are that the 4-in-1s usually accommodate children that have surpassed the toddler stage.  Meaning they can sit directly into the chair without the booster.[[ PROS ]]- Easy to put together.- Easy to clean (fabric is easy to wipe and can be washed, tray comes with insert to make it easier when washing)- Adjustable reclining, height, & footrest positions can accommodate a growing baby- 5 point harness- Has wheels on front 2 legs so that you can roll it around the house.- Our daughter looks around, coos, and laughs while in the seat.  She just likes being around us and has not fussed at all while in her seat during our mealtimes![[ CONS ]]- According to other reviews, there are reports that if you have wood floors, this can scratch them up. While it hasn't (yet), I took the initiative of researching more.  It seems that this will scratch up your floors from the back legs.  The plastic will wear down over time and that's when the damage starts.  I took the initiative and purchased some furniture pads (adhesive) and taped them up to the back of the chair.  No chance for this chair to scratch up my wood floors!- No wheel lock.  I know this isn't a stroller, but I would have appreciated a wheel lock.  While my daughter is too small to wiggle with enough force to get the chair to scoot, I anticipate it will eventually happen.  Not sure if it would have been a safety hazard, but I think it would have been a great feature.Overall, my wife and I love this chair and couldn't be happier.  Thanks Amazon!",5
3959,"We are very happy with this high chair. It's very practical and easy to clean. I agree with other reviewers that the tray is hard to get off, but my husband and I can do it, no problem. I would be aware of this if the person who cleans it is weaker in the arms. Overall very satisfied and would recommend it based on the price and functionality.",5
3960,"I am absolutely in love with my high-chair!  In fact, I think it's the best high chair I've seen hands down! I've recommended this chair to all my pregnant friends because I love it so much.  My good friend and I actually got ours around the same time, and she loves her Duo Diner too.  Here's what I love about it:-  You can wipe the seat clean super easy.  The cover doesn't look or feel like vinyl at all, but it wipes like vinyl.- You can take off the top part of the tray to wash.- The tray wipes clean super easy also.-  FAVORITE PART! It turns into a booster seat.  If you remove the seat from the high chair stand, you can secure it onto the table chair.  You can use it with or without the tray this way.  The arms of the high chair keep your little one secure on the sides (along with the safety straps), but they fit under the table so you can scoot your child close to the table (when not using the tray).-  The straps and cover come off easily and always wash clean.  My son stained it with blueberries, and when it was out of the washer, it was as good as new.-  You can order new covers from Gracobaby.com.  I wanted to change up the high chair for my 2nd son, so I just ordered a new cover in a different pattern.",5
3961,"Easy to use, love the latch! They sell this at BRU for $20 more, without the latch, and with these weird lights at the headrest. No thanks! This is light, easy to out to put together, easy to latch, and comfy. Will adjust a ton. Fits my 42 pound, 40 in son great with plenty of room to grow.",5
3962,"I did a lot of research as I looked for a new booster for my son. We had one that was given to us, but I didn't like it for every day use (it didn't latch to the seat as this one does, so as he would get in and out of it himself it would often tip and he nearly fell out of the (parked) car a few times). This one can be used with the back or backless, so should last us until he is done using a booster. This one latches in fairly easily (the only complaint I have is that there's not a lot of give to get the latch to the ring in the seat...) and I feel much more at ease with my son riding it in that I did before. He's a little shorter, so the hook for the seat belt up by the head is awesome and used every time for us. It helps keep it in place where it should be. I've taught him exactly how it should be fitting so he makes sure he tells everyone (grandparents, aunts, daddy, etc) where the seat belt should be positioned and how tight. He loves the cupholder and the compartment on the other side is great for little toys and/or sunglasses. I like that the compartment can slide in, therefore it takes up less space. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a booster.",5
3963,"High rating and great for my tall 4yo. I bought one for both grandparents. These were easy to assemble and use, and easy to use is something our parents need.",5
3964,"I'm a new mom in the summer. This is the best choice ever for wraps. Easy to use and put everything in place. The quality of the material is excellent. Super breathable for hot days..",5
3965,"I'm a side/belly sleeper but didn't want to buy one of those huge pregnancy pillows, this little coma-shaped pillow is a life-saver. Perfect size, i use it as a head/neck support for reading and then put it between my legs and under/around my bump for bed. I can sleep on my side and even towards my belly a little but I'm still propped-up & supported enough that I'm not crushing the baby. It's also small enough that I can roll over to my other side without having to readjust much & it doesn't over-crowd my husband. Can't say enough good things about it. Best pregnancy buy!",5
3966,"I bought this product, but ended up returning it because I couldn't see how it would ever stay clean. There is no separate cover, so you have to actually wash the pillow itself. The pillow does break up into 3 sections, which makes that possible, though difficult. I bought a $20 body pillow with a washable case instead.",1
3967,"This was an OK support band for running in early pregnancy, but once the belly gets bigger it doesn't give much support. I had to switch to a sturdier band.",3
3968,"My almost 6 month old baby loves this monkey! It's a great size and is so soft. He snuggles w/ it at bedtime. I bought it at a time when it was on sale and available on Prime - even better!",5
3969,"These pouches are perfect for my son! After I discovered the ready-made pureed food pouches in stores, I searched online for a way to store the food I was already making for my kid in a similar convenient way - and these pouches fit the bill! Most of the other options only held about 4 oz, but my son is quite the bottomless pit, so I love that these hold 6 oz (more if you don't mind a little mess). The &#34;fill&#34; line is a great indicator so you easily gauge how much is in the pouch, and the &#34;zipper&#34; top has held up through countless hand and machine washes! I've had these for 6 months already, and even though my son is 21 months (read: quick-onset toddler tantrums), I love that I can fill them with applesauce or yogurt ahead of time and it's ready when he is. They're also GREAT for car rides - he can easily sip it from his carseat. I have yet to have one spill it's contents, the lids screw on securely and my son hasn't figured out how to undo the top zipper yet. I haven't had any issues with freezing/thawing distorting the plastic, but the only minor tweak would be to make them microwave safe - then baby purees could be warmed up without requiring another bowl. The spout also seems a little wide than other brands, so as your kid gets older and can handle textures, you can put in lumpier foods and they can squeeze them out no problem. I've started using them as snack bags for dry goods as well, so I see our uses for these things extending for as long as they hold up - hopefully years!",5
3970,"This is nice for doing yogurt or applesauce to go but its hard for LO to get that last little bit out since its a flat bottom. If this were more like a food pouch you see in a store where its more of an envelope fold at the bottom I think it would be easier for him to get all the food out.  Still a good buy though and super easy to clean!",3
3971,"This thing is amazing! It's beautiful to look at and so incredibly functional. We used our Lotus during a recent vacation and it was a lifesaver. First, it takes up half the space of a standard pack n' play. Second, it's incredibly light so traveling with it isn't an issue. It's very easy and quick to set up and take down and easy to clean. Our baby used it as both a place to sleep and a play pen during the day when we needed to contain her. The netting is very durable and breatheable. She slept in it all night with no issues too, so it must be pretty comfortable. I cannot recommend this product enough. It is so much easier to use than a traditional pack n' play. There was clearly a lot of effort put into developing this product. It's by far the best made baby product we have purchased since our daughter was born (and we've bought a lot). When not traveling, we plan on using it around the house as an easy-to-set-up baby jail.",5
3972,"We purchased the lotus and the baby bjorn for an upcoming trip across the country. For us it was a no-brainier, the baby bjorn won out. I found the fold to be slightly more complicated, the mattress to be thiner, and we preferred the solid strip of fabric that runs around the crib like a bumper on the bjorn. I also HATED the quilted sheet that I purchase for the lotus- it made the mattress curl up. Overall I think this is a good quality travel crib, but just not for us.",2
3973,"We have done a lot of different beds for my little one. When she was small 0-5 months she slept in a baby hammock made in Hawaii. We LOVED it and it was the best thing for her age.  We tried a few nights in a cosleeper (both in bed and one attached to the bed) both were not good for my heavy-sleeping husband and neither provided much safety. If you really want a cosleeping bed, get a crib that can go level with your mattress.When she transitioned to a crib, she had no problem sleeping but we had problems with using bumpers. We were concerned for the breathability of it, so we tried the mesh liner that is popular and available everywhere. She would toss and turn and whack her head on the crib rails. So we put the bumper on. We never saw a problem with breathability or suffocation risk (although i was super panicked and check in on her at night numerous times) but eventually she learned to climb so off went the bumper again. This time we saw her little limbs stuck through the rails. Horribly upsetting. So we put her in a traditional pack-n-play by Graco. The bottom is off the ground and for whatever reason, she could not/would not sleep in it.  Then we tried the Pea in the Pod travel bed we used on a few trips. Although there are many perks, she eventually got freaked out to be in a confined area that wouldn't allow her to stand up.  ...So here we are on bed number 100 and the minute she got into this she was fine and slept like a dream. Back to her early days of 12 hours a night. Yes, seriously that long.So in a nutshell...1. Set up took under 3 minutes2. It really is lightweight (good for older parents, grandparents, going to/fro upstairs or outside and back)3. Montessori friendly with the zipper that means eventually we can leave it open and have our lil one crawl in and out at will.4. on the ground (sturdy, no walking problems, also she won't be climbing over, just walk out of it)5. the conversion to future bassinet for my next one is a great option6. large bed area7. mesh sides- no suffocation risk and no limbs caught in slots between crib bars.8. fits in her travel luggage on a plane and also can work as a backpack carry-on if we want to not check it in.9. the set up is easy with the moon star images that squeeze together. I gave away a packnplay this morning and tried showing them how to set it up. it took over 10 minutes. i seriously hate those things. i wanted a 4moms but i could justify the extra $ at the time.My only eh part is that yet again i have to accommodate the mattress crib linens. I don't want a standard sheet so I am going to retrofit an existing one and create button hole enclosures to go around the velcro tabs that secure the mattress to the crib mesh bottom.  Also, one velcro tab came off within seconds of me pulling lightly on it.****Update:: do NOT put this in the main luggage compartment on an airplane. Our bag ripped and cut through the netting  of the bed. I sewed it up and on the return flight we just carried it on(along with way too many baby things. :)",5
3974,"We researched this online and found it on Amazon for a great price.  We've traveled by car and plane with this crib.  It condenses down to a carry-on and unfolds to a great size.  It's well made to the point we used it on the beach as a sunscreen (get the add on cover) for our daughter.  Couldn't say enough good things about this product in general.  Simple to open and use, simple to put away.",5
3975,"Ive tried several pouches, and this is my favorite. It's large, and having the closure on top makes it easier to fill. It did take my daughter a bit to figure out the side spout though!",4
3976,"so many of the pouches are hard to clean, open up on their own or hard to fill.  This product is not of the above.  I have had them for 4 weeks now and used them many times and am very pleased.",5
3977,"I really wanted to love these pouches, and I mostly do. I make my own baby food and I hate the idea of disposable pouches and all the waste that goes along with them. LGPs solve that problem! These pouches are easy for my 9 month old to handle, and he enjoys squeezing them and sucking food straight out of them. They are also great for sending my home made food to daycare. But I just can't give them a 5-star rating because they are REALLY hard to clean. They are dishwasher safe, but the dishwasher is not able to get the small food particles that accumulate in the bottom corners of the pouch. The only way I can clean these is to fill them with water, let them soak for an hour or so, and then scrape the corners with a butter knife. It works, but it's a bit impractical.I also bought a 10-pack of the Nourish reusable pouches at the same time I purchased these. In comparison to the Nourish pouches, the Little Green Pouches are more durable, thicker, and the zip lock seal is much more secure. My Nourish pouches leak all the time. My LGPs have never leaked. The Nourish pouches are a little easier to clean by hand, although they are not dishwasher safe. I do like that the LGPs can hold quite a bit of food, so as my baby eats more these can grow with him.",4
3978,"I get comments from other moms about these all the time.  They are definitely worth the money as I have used them pretty much daily.The zip is very reliable so long as you can get it zipped.  This just takes a little muscle at times.The bottom pops out so the pouch stands on its own, this is really helpful for filling it.There is a place on the back to write your child's name.  Even using a permanent marker my son's name washes off after a couple of days (& we don't have a dish washer so it's only getting hand washed).  This isn't really a big deal, actually it means that the food doesn't stain the plastic.  That's nice since it keeps things from looking shabby.",5
3979,"These are great pouches!  Probably the best on the market right now!  Easy to clean. Easy to put food in them. Holds up well.  The zip lock is durable and stays close when my kids are eating.  Just two things that would make them even better... It would be nice to have smaller ones for babies/toddlers. And two, I love that the bottom of the pouch is clear so I can see if it's been cleaned well. What about making more of the pouch see through? Maybe the back?  I thought having the spout on the side would bother me but I actually like that the spout is in the side and the zipper part is in the top. Less messes this way.",5
3980,"This product has been great. Easy to use and easy to clean. The only downside is it's a bit bigger than your normal &#34;go go squeezy &#34; pouch, but well worth the investment. Now I can make my own food and fill these without spending all the money to buy the pouches!",5
3981,"So I made my own pumping bra by just cutting holes in a sports bra. It worked great with the shields that separate from the connector. I'd put the shield in. Point the end through the hole, then connect the connector on the outside. Perfect.But this one piece contraption doesn't work like that at all. Not sure how I'd even adapt a bra to work with it. I'd have given it one star, but if you're only doing one side, it works great. So I guess it just depends on how you want to use it.",2
3982,"You can't beat the price on this kit compared to the Medela replacement parts. It fits my pump perfectly. The tubing is a softer tubing which I actually prefer because it is a little easier to manipulate. The cones however are attached to the thing that attaches to the bottle which is different than the Medela brand. At first I thought this might be a negative but I now like it because it is one less piece to lose, wash, and lug around. Even if you don't need this kit right now I would suggest getting it to have on hand incase something happens to your stock kit.",5
3983,"I ordered this cup and then had to have it replaced due to leaking around the lid where it screwed on. It's great as long as it sits upright. If the straw is open, it will make puddles on the floor (or wherever) if it tips. Even with the lid closed (straw concealed) if it is tipped or shaken too much it might leak when opened. My granddaughter likes to drink from this cup but I do have to watch it closely.",3
3984,"This is the best investment I have made when it comes to my grandson... This is so quiet, and he loves the soft motion it has.. I looked all over and read all reviews, and this was and is the best...Thank you",5
3985,"This glider is awesome!  Don't know why I kept our rickety old Graco swing from when my daughter used it five years ago.  It is old, clunky and on the brink of dying, so I needed a new swing.  My son is now almost 18 months and over 20 pounds, and he may only have a few more months in a swing, but this is honestly the only way he will nap during the day.  After trying, and failing, to get my son to sleep in his crib, I went back to the swing because I needed to save my sanity.  So, purchasing another swing was what we needed.  I LOVE this glider!  It moves just like a gliding chair you would use to rock your child in your arms.  I can't put my son in it while he's awake, because he just screams, but once I put him to sleep I can transfer him in here and he sleeps a long, nice nap.  I have it gliding on setting 4 and it's perfect for him to stay asleep.The glider footprint is much smaller than the last Graco swing we had, which was so big and clunky.  My husband and I were always tripping on the feet that came out so awkwardly.  We hated our old swing.  This one is much smaller, and takes up less space.  Something we needed, because we live in a small two bedroom house and the swing sits in our bedroom, along with the crib and changing table.I also love that the glider plugs into an outlet.  I got so sick of changing batteries in a panic, trying to do it while my son was asleep in the swing - hoping and praying he wouldn't wake up before I had the new batteries in.It also glides continuously until you turn it off.  The sound stays on, as well, until you turn it off.  These were all the features we needed to keep our son happy and sleeping.  There are timers, though, if you want things to shut off after a certain amount of time.  Sounds are loud enough, glider moves well even with my  20-some pound son in it.  And it's high enough off the ground that his feet don't touch the floor.  Also buckles him in quite nicely so I don't feel he's going to fall out.Love the recline options.  He almost lays flat, but just up enough that if your kid suffers from reflux, it won't bother them while they're lying there.Only flaws in my opinion are: wish it had a buckle like the BOB stroller, the 5 point harness. The buckle barely reaches around his waist, can't use the shoulder straps because they're too short. I just use the buckle around his waist and watch on the monitor. When he starts to wake I go get him out.  I also use the white noise sound and it is a little loud so I drape a small blanket over the speaker to muffle the sound a bit.Summary:- Glides and sounds stay on all the time, or as long as you need (timer option)- Works well with older babies (toddlers), I think the weight limit is 30 lbs- Takes up less space than older model swings.  Nice, ergonomic look- Plugs into wall (battery option)- Reclines to almost flat position, and sitting up position- Wish they had one for adults.  Looks amazing and comfy!Bottom line:  If you need a swing (baby to toddler) BUY THIS GLIDER! DON'T HESITATE!",5
3986,"I thought long and hard before buying this because of the reviews talking about how hard it was to make this thing glide (i.e. all of the &#34;hidden design flaw&#34; reviews). There is no &#34;hidden design flaw.&#34; It is a construction flaw, if anything. My husband set this up without a problem. It glides just fine. I will say however that the toy bar IS flimsy and will most likely be knocked down by the kid once she gets old enough to do so. Also, the music is very tinny and quite annoying, but the baby seems to like it so I deal with it. Also, the nature sounds are much easier to tolerate. I do wish the volume could go a little quieter, but again, it doesn't seem to bother the baby so it's okay.The glider is overall a bit noisy, especially if you have everything turned on at once (vibrate, glide, and music/sounds). But I think compared to other gliders/swings this isn't anything strange. The insert is very soft, and I love love love that it reclines!!Overall, I love this glider and would buy it again and again. Totally worth the price, and on top of it, is a lot more attractive than many of the other swings/gliders. As a side note, I would suggest this one over the petite version just because it is easier to put the baby in this one since it is closer to where she is when she falls asleep in my arms.",5
3987,"I got this as a gift and it worked well for my baby's first 4 weeks or so, but once he hit a certain weight (maybe 10 lbs.) the thing stopped swinging even on the highest level. Now we have to push it manually, which is stupid. The bar in the middle also falls down and won't stay in place. My son really likes watching the things swing and those flowers were some of the first objects he focused on, but the bar topples on him easily. It's soft so it doesn't hurt or anything, but again it is poorly designed. I wouldn't waste your money on this glider at all!",1
3988,"I was skeptical of spending so much on a swing.  But it was so worth it!  This swing is great!  We have used it for three months now.  In the beginning out 5lb 12oz baby was a little small for the swing.  When she was wrapped in a blanket she fit better.  Now she is 10 pounds and it still works great!I love that the swing gets plugged in.  No need to buy batteries:). Also the feature of having the chair move in two different directions is great!  Our little one like a change sometimes.  Now. That she is older she likes to situ the rocker.  It is east to rock with your foot. While you're. Eating dinner, watching tv, or ant other activity.  The music is another great  feature.  We liked the classical music the best.I never used the vibrate option so I can not say how it works.It does take up quiets bit of room but it Is sturdy.",5
3989,"I love this swing. The best feature is that the seat part detaches to become a separate rocker. I put it in the bathroom with me while I take a shower to keep my baby occupied. My baby loves the ocean waves sound for nap time. When he was a few weeks old this swing was the only thing he would nap in. The only thing I don't like about this swing is the mobile. The one on the fisherprice snagabunny/puppy swing is much better because it turns by itself, lights up, and moves. This mobile on this swing doesn't do anything and doesn't even have colors the baby can look at. I ended up putting different toys up.Pros:- lots of soothing sounds and music options- 2 vibration speeds- soft seat- fabric is easy to remove for washing.- Swings side to side or front to back.- seat becomes a removable rockerCons- Boring mobile.",4
3990,"The color is a bit to be desired, but the usefulness of this design can't be beat.  The swing comes with the ac adapter, which some swings do not, and swings very smooth.  The song selection is pretty good, as well as nature sounds.  The detachable seat for bouncer use is great, as it takes away the need to purchase an additional item, AND consolidates the two together to make better use of space.We love this item, but wish it had more color, as it is VERY bland.",4
3991,"I LOVE this swing.  After working in early childhood for 20 years, I knew exactly what I was looking for in a swing for my baby.  I purchased it due to it's ability to swing both side to side and front to back.  Babies tend to love one or the other, and it's impossible to know what they will love before they arrive.  I also love that the swing can be removed and used as a bouncy seat/rocker that even vibrates!  The swing is very well made.  The fabric is super soft and the pattern on it is beautiful and can work for a boy or a girl.",5
3992,"I have purchased TONS of different straw cups, and I have to say that these are the BEST. Yes, they are rather large (not sure what that is)...but they're fun & easy for kids to hold, and the weighted straw is wonderful. They're also super easy to wash...and to open/close (which is a HUGE drawback of the Zoli cups). Your little one will learn to successfully drink with this weighted straw, which moves around so that s/he gets every last sip. These cups are quite resilient..and I haven't had them leak at all.Yes, they may leak if thrown...but which cup won't do that?!",5
3993,"Works well in our BumbleRide stroller. Especially like the little zip-off pocket. You have to get used to how to best squeeze some things in and out of it, since it's soft-sided -- almost like breaking in a new pair of Chuck Taylors -- but once you do, piece of cake. Happy buyer.",5
3994,"We returned this and got the less expensive Diono organizer because we liked that it had a bit more structure than this one. The wristlet is a good idea though!",3
3995,"a huge disappointment. it sags, and can't hold any bottles. Bottles just flip over. Forget even trying putting in adult drinks.",2
3996,"This was a basket stuffer for my new little ones Easter basket. She was only 3 days old on Easter so I had to stuff it with rattles and stuffed animals rather than candy.",5
3997,"I had a skip hop bag with my first daughter and hated it.  I really love weight of this bag and all of its many pockets.  I haven't even begun to fill them all.  Read the reviews below that are more detailed and enjoy your purchase!",5
3998,"This is a nice clutch.  Few things I don't really care for about it.  It's pretty bulky, especially once you get some diapers in there (I've been able to fit 3 size 4's in it).  The other thing that I don't really care for is when all you need is a wipe, and you have to unfold the whole darn thing to get one wipe out, for face or hands or something.  There is a goofy way to fold it up so they aren't so hard to get too but it gets sloppy.  But aside from that, I do like that it has the attached changing mat, and it's super easy to clean (outside and inside).  I like the strap has a hook on it so it makes it versatile for lots of situations.  Also, its been put through some abuse and its holding up just dandy!  Quality is great!  Design is what I struggle with on it.",3
3999,"Well made , big enough to be used as your baby grow .The reason why I took a star is because the color is not as shown in the picture , the leather is more a pewteresh than Goldesh !!but we love the bright green inside :)",4
4000,"This was purchased as a baby shower gift.  It is adorable and works great.  It was a great price too.",5
4001,"Setup (A): Piece of cake.  Took me about 5-10 minutes and did not require instructions.  Unlike other pressure-mounted gates I've used before, the different pieces actually stay together when trying to mount to the wall which makes things much easier.  Although, as part of the design, until it's pressure-mounted, the gate can swing wide open while you are setting up.  Just use some masking tape.  You cannot tell from the picture, but there are three (not two) expansion pieces each of which are a different size.  This allows the gate to fit into (as far as I can tell) any size opening.Looks (A): Other than a few pieces of plastic, the metal and wood look very quality, and also great together.  Sturdiness of metal, looks of wood.Functionality (B): Gate is pretty easy to open with one hand -- lift and pull.  That is, if you didn't accidentally lock the gate the last time you closed it.  If you push downward after the gate has latched, it will lock.  Sometimes I do it inadvertently.  Requires flipping a plastic switch to unlock again.  The pressure mounting require some fine-tuning to make sure the gate doesn't lock EVERY time (or also never, no matter how hard you push down).  The rubber nubs on the end of the mounds seem great and are not marking up my walls.  Another minor complaint is that this gate does not auto-close or auto-latch.  I also own a Northstates Supergate Easy-Close and that feature is Awesome!Overall (A-): Very nice-looking gate at a good value.  Probably one of the best gates you can get for larger openings (up to 60&#34;).  I recommend it, although I knock it down to 4 stars only because it does not auto-close or auto-latch.PS: Contrary to another reviewer who put up a video, you CAN put this in an opening with floorboards or uneven walls because you can adjust each of the four mounts to different lengths.  I have mine up against a floorboard now.",4
4002,"This is a very cute idea but it didn't work so well for us...First of all, we have an Uppababy Vista and the fit of this toy against our baby's face is a bit weird.  Even now at 9 months she is always a bit too close to it to really notice all the 3 toys. When on the stroller bar, she doesn't pay too much attention to the mirror and chews on the monkey only occasionally. The pear and the zebra go completely unnoticed.Also the toy ends up rotating around the stroller bar and often ends up facing out.It's a really cute idea. The toy is well made. It wasn't a good fit for our child and our stroller. I wouldn't purchase this again.",3
4003,"We have only been using this for a couple weeks as we have transitioned our daughter into her &#34;big girl bed&#34; and the strap that goes under the mattress has already broke. Really unfortunate to have a product fail so quickly, so while the length is good and the idea is great, it's not well made.",2
4004,"This jogger is so massive, heavy, and bulky. I absolutely hated it. I am a short person, 5'2, and the handle bar was so tall that it was just under my collar bone, which made it horribly awkward and painful to push. It is extremely heavy and really hard for a small person like me to fold up and down and getting it in/out of the car was a real challenge. For someone who is taller and larger than me, it's probably much better, but my husband who is 5'8 still thought it was heavy and difficult to move.The front wheel kept getting stuck and turning funny on any surface other than smooth road. It even got stuck a few times in sidewalk cracks and crossing a wood-plank bridge was impossible. It is a horrible experience to use on any remotely rough surface like dirt or crushed gravel trails and pretty much has no suspension so it jostles baby around a lot. It's cheap, and I get that most people dig the price, but if you are small and an avid runner who doesn't want to be stuck only road-running, I'd strongly suggest investing your money in a better quality jogger. I sold this after only a few runs with it and replaced it with a BOB, which is fantastic and amazing in all of the ways this one lacks and more.",1
4005,"These are great. Inserts are super soft, outside design is cute/vibrant, and the snap system is perfect for growing (or different sized!) babies. We have twins that are 3lbs apart and they fit both well (and have for months). Much better than a few of the more expensive brands we have tried. We don't use cloth diapers full time, but will use them on occasion and really like these. The design has held up well between washes and the snaps are preferred over velcro from other brands.You can order these cheaper from the company website, but if you are like us and only need a few (and want them fast), then Amazon is the way to go. The price is cheaper than many competitor brands, but you are not sacrificing quality. We ordered one of this brand (diff design) to begin with, but were so happy ordered additional ones (including this one) once we saw how much we liked the first one.",5
4006,"this is the only 10oz learner I can find in the larger size. The NUK learner has worked amazing for my 6 month old. This larger one is still a little too heavy once full for her but I know in a month or so she will handle perfectly. Right now, we're using the 5oz and I think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread for my baby!",5
4007,"We've had these bottles for quite some time now. They do have the option of a toddler spout for a sippy cup and do take AVENT nipples for replacements. The silicone covers are EXTREMELY hard to get on and off, make sure you put a little dish soap in the cover before sliding it n. The paint does not chip when covers are applied but it does not stop them from denting either. Yes they hurt when dropped and thrown, they're stainless steel and can break a tv screen when thrown!",3
4008,"Nothing wrong with these bottles, work just fine. But I think the Kid Kanteen ones are nicer looking.OTOH, the Pura bottles have sippy cup attachments so they're a good investment.I stuck some duct tape to my bottle as a label, that was a stupid thing to do but on taking it off, a little of the paint chipped off. Granted I shouldn't have used tape that stuck so strongly but didn't like the paint coming off.",3
4009,"I love these sippy cups.  Very easy to clean and no plastic, which I care about.  They do not leak from the ring, but can leak from the nipple.  I tend to use the sippy cup rather than the nipple.",5
4010,"I bought these because I was very sore the first couple weeks after starting to breastfeed and heat felt good. I didn't think id use these for anything else but I was wrong. These snap in a circle so they can go around the flanges of your pump to help get the most out of your session. The fact that they can be used cold too is also helpful as it helps relieve pain. The covers they come with are soft and wash well. Where you can reuse these over and over (and i do multiple times each day) they're very conomical. I would recommend these to anyone.",5
4011,"I have 3 kids and have used many different pack and plays/play yards.  This one is the BEST.I originally had a fairly basic Graco one, and through, eh, good enough.  With my first daughter we only used it for trips, or before she started crawling downstairs on the weekends.  It was enough for us at the time.When we had our twins a year and a half later, we realized the power that was a portable crib/plyayard!  One of the twins was a screamer and slept in our room for the first 5 months, since her brother was a good but light sleeper.  She drooled through that pack n play in a month.  Gross!I wish that I had found this one the first go round - it has the cool bassinet attachment for when they are tiny, and the changing pad thing which is handy if you need another one in a different part of the house.  It's also on the larger side for playards, and has plenty of other bells and whistles.Now, the BEST part of this thing is that it's washable.  This doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is. Those sheet things come off easily, and kids manage to get drool/spit up EVERYWHERE.  You can slide the slats out of the bottom pad, and unzip the mesh sides from the frame and toss them in the wash.  It's honestly the very best part of this thing and I will never go back.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this playard; the price it really worth it.",5
4012,"WE LIVE IN THIS PACK & PLAY! Its in our living room- really  nice features w the infant sleep area and the changer- def love the side carrier that holds diapers wipes and necessities and all extra stuff goes in the pack and play which makes everything easy to access. Our baby sleeps all of the time in the infant sleeper- it has breathable vents on either side of the head area and the songs that they have are very soothing and enjoyable for even adults to listen to. GREAT BABY ITEM! A must have for all new moms!",5
4013,"What a wonderful and sturdy pack and play! There is everything you can possibly need, all in one place. The little bassinet is very sturdy and comfy-looking, and most importantly-safe. Just make sure only a very young infant sleeps in it as it's obviously not intended for larger or older babies. The changing table is also very convenient and doesn't get at all in the way. The actual playard is large and if you use it for a larger baby to sleep in- a bit more comfortable-looking than most pack and plays. The mattress is not all that great but it isn'y flimsy either.It comes in a very neutral color and the nearly every single thing is washable! All the fabric comes off fairly easily and fits into a standard washing machine beautifully. There's a mini console to keep things like extra diapers, cloths, etc and finally you can play some soothing music as well. This is a multi-use pack and play that is priced well for everything that it comes with. Highly recommended!",5
4014,"This playard is much superior to the Graco ones.  It's very sturdy, very attractive with gender neutral colors, easy to set up and take apart, and I use all the options included on here.  I love that the changing pod sits higher up than the Graco one, it's so much easier on my back.  I'm only 5'4&#34;, but it was a noticeable different in height!  The organizer tray is extremely useful and I keep all my diaper changing essentials in there.  The bassinet is super soft and sturdy.  The changing pod is just the right height.If you practice Elimination Communication, this makes a perfect little hub.  I put the baby potty in the bassinet and the whole thing is a perfect potty station for my newborn.  All of the fabric can be taken off and washed.Con - there's only one con with this playard:  the bassinet cover we got seems to have the hole in the wrong place.  The instructions show two holes in the bassinet cover so that the support pole goes through one of the holes and that helps keep the cover on, but in ours, there's only one hole.  We had to rig it up so it still works, but the cover is now a bit askew.  Not a big deal, it's still perfectly functional, but worth mentioning.I really like the bowed out legs - they seem to open up the space in there better than playards with straight legs.  The whole unit has a very airy, open, clean and comfortable feel to it.  Everything is exactly where it should be and it's very sturdy while being very portable.  Would definitely recommend this product.  It is a must have for a new baby.",5
4015,"The super awesome thing about this set is that the parts are washable.  Washable!  Easily removed and run through the laundry. Because your kid will puke/pee/poop/slobber on it.  And so many playpens aren't easy to wash, and just get grimy and gross before long.  Doesn't seem all that innovative (or ingenious) but you'd be surprised how hard it is to find.  Makes this the one to buy, in my mind.",4
4016,"these are really cute really easy to fill. They are a little expensive but I've had them for about a year I just keep them clean and dry take care of them cute",5
4017,"these have made it soo much easier for my 8 month old to use baby food pouches without food getting all over the place. I bring them everywhere... I wish they had caps, though. Everyone who sees them asks where I got them!",4
4018,"I actually bought this at Target, but please take note; this placemat is NOT intended for small toddlers. My 1-yr-old flings it onto the floor everytime we've tried to use it. Food everywhere! I'm hoping we can get some use out of it as she gets older, but as of right now it's been a waste of time and money. Not crazy about the silicone either as it gets mucky even when washed and folded.",2
4019,"First things first, this is a great placemat.  I've used it at 10+ restaurants, at home, at a friends' house....it never fails to stick pretty good.  I've got a pretty docile baby, so while she's lifted the edges a bit she's never attempted to truly pull this thing off the table.  If you have a child who likes to flip. lift, whirl, or just generally cause mischief, short of gluing a placemat down or using one with industrial grade suction cups NO placemat will work for you.  Otherwise, this placemat rolls up super easy, sticks, well, and cleans easily.One point deducted because the pictures on Amazon show a either a white placemat with numbers/food, or a solid green placemat.  I received a placemat with numbers/food that was clear and see-through otherwise.  Would really had preferred it to be a solid color to make messes more visible, but it's not a huge hindrance.",4
4020,"My 14 month old loves these forks. Easy to use. Short enough that he can maneuver them easily. Have now purchased them twice.",5
4021,"My 10 month old has loved these the past few months. They are very easy for her to hold and get into her mouth. They are lightweight yet sturdy. I highly recommend these.",5
4022,"These are a great start for teaching kids to use regular silverware.  We found the forks to be a little on the worthless side, but they did force our son to take his time and focus on trying to pick up food with it.  The best part was it didn't hurt like regular silver wear when he stabbed us with it.",5
4023,"Perfect coverage! My only complaint is that my C3 being as expensive as it is should already come with this but it doesn't. I love that it extends to cover the feet while still being able to ventilate. Baby seems to enjoy the shade while still being able to peek out around him. It's great and I would recommend this to anyone who has a bugaboo as they make it for the bee as well!",5
4024,"Our baby overheats in the Bugaboo fleece cover and anything black/dark as a cover.  We live in Los Angeles so it's in the 90s to 100s.  This silver cover with breeze vents and sun protective fabric is AMAZING!  We have the Bugaboo from 2007 that a friend gave us and it fits perfectly.",5
4025,"Love the canopy and am thankful for it. I do however wish there were a few modifications&#8230; I wish the mesh carried a better SPF, and that  the &#34;peak-a-boo&#34; window was larger,  or best yet the whole front section was higher SPF mesh.",4
4026,"great price, great quality and nice layout of pages.  i also like the selection of questions and themes.  nice overall.",4
4027,"This memory book is pretty and I love the cover, but I was a little disappointed by the inside pages.  The only colors inside the book are pink, white, and gray.  Personally, I think an accent color would have made the book a little less dull.I have the Gibson Meadowlark book for my older daughter and love that book!  It's a lot more cheery and vibrant on the inside.",3
4028,"I have a ton of aden + anais products and love almost all of them. I gave this only 4 stars because despite being in the weight guidelines, this fit a little large at first and my daughter would end up with the &#34;wrap piece&#34; in odd positions. It is very comfy and easy enough to put in, but does run a little large.",4
4029,"I like the pouches they are a  really good. easy to fill easy for the baby to eat out of.  You do need to make sure to clean them the little edges and the cap a small animation the baby doesn't play with it.I've had them for a year now and they're still good you just need keep them cleaned.  best of all they're cheap andthey don't just fall apart you do need to take care of them.",5
4030,"I bought two of these so each grand-baby would have one on his car seat. The babies play with them the moment they spy them. My mistake has nothing to do with this toy, but rather with the car seats. The bar that this toy curls around must be left in an upright position when locked into the car seat base in the car, so the baby cannot play while riding in the car. You might want to check how the bar will be positioned on your baby's car seat if you purchase this to use in the car.",4
4031,"This little guy was perfect for putting on the stroller. My daughter LOVES it. The only complaint I have is that the quality was a little lacking. I've had to stitch up a few things since we got it. But it's a brilliant stroller accessory for babies who love tags.",3
4032,"She loves it, I love that she loves it.  She coos and talks to the big eyed plushy caterpillar and I talk to him too.  We talk at night and discuss things like Politics, dirty diapers, Pizza crusts, and all sorts of cool things.  Then he entertains my little girl and smiles all the time.Let your little one smile all the time.  Get this curly caterpillar thing-a-ma-bobby.",5
4033,"I love this product.  Affordable, practical and good for ALL seasons because in NYC our air conditioning gets pretty cold at night.",5
4034,"very disappointing. I always used HALO sleep sacks but this one was way too big. I had to return it and bought another brand.",1
4035,"These blankets are very practical. I don't have to worry all night long whether the kid managed to kick off a blanket. What really surprised me was that the kids WANTED to wear them. One of the kids for whom I got this blanket asks for it before going to sleep. Now, that's nice!",5
4036,"HALO sleepsacks are the best!  No other sleepsacks are made with the same quality.  He stays warm and it stays put!  So much safer than using a blanket which shouldn't be done for children under 1 year old.  The swaddle is great for when they are still young - swaddling is comforting.  Then eventually, he learned how to get his arms out so we no longer use that, but he still wears it.  We just fasten it under his arms.",5
4037,"Tried a few swaddles and this brand works great - it keeps our babies hands inside a lot better then most of the other swaddles we tried. He can still escape once in a while but overall holds him together well. The velcro is loud so if you need to change your baby or reswaddle them while they are sleeping it might wake or stir them. The small is pretty large so this wrap will last you a while - our baby is 4 months now and still uses it.",4
4038,"We are out of the swaddle phase now but I loved these sleep sacks. We had the Summer Infant ones as well and they didn't hold a candle to these. I also love that the directions are sewn in so when my mother in law or friend would care for my son they could easily reference it. My son loved these. It was a sad day when he hulked out of the swaddle!",5
4039,"I love this as well as my son's other Halo sack.  I tried the aden and anais brand as well but it didn't hold up to even one wash.  These are quality and I love that I will be able to reuse them for another baby some day.",5
4040,"This is the best product ever!  My son is 9 months and sleeps every night with this sleep sack. Love, love, love!",5
4041,"My baby has slept in these every night since she was born. She's almost 15 months now. Safe way to allow baby to sleep with a &#34;blanket.&#34; Keeps her warm, but short sleeves keep from over-heating. Cute designs.",5
4042,"My almost two year old daughter was outgrowing her medium sleep sacks, so I ordered a new one in large.  She is on the shorter end and weighs 27 pounds.  This sleep sack fits great with room to grow.  It is also very soft (maybe that is because it has not been through the washing machine a bunch of times).  It is also a cute pattern.",5
4043,"I liked the first one I got, so I got another. My only thing is that this is a bit on the heavy side, so it's great for the winter. Now that it's summer not so much. Other than that, it really is a great product that my fast growing baby can't fit into anymore anyway.",4
4044,"I love this , but I've had to return 2 of them already because the zipper breaks. I'm on my 3rd one now...hopefully this one lasts longer.",3
4045,"Warm, soft, and cozy.  Baby loves these sleep sacks in the winter.  My only gripe with this one is that I had a small issue with the zipper but learned to make it work. Love these sleep sacks.",4
4046,"These are great sleepers after your baby is too active to use SwaddleMe sleepers at night. We've been using these ever since putting him in his crib",4
4047,"I don't use it for every mess but it is great for the big poo splosions.  I find it awkward squeezing the water out and my diapers are longer than the shield.  That is why I reserve if for the big messes.  I don't want poop all over the toilet.",4
4048,"I use this daily, and have had no issues with it.Sprays off easily.Light weightHolds heavy stuffed diapersI have had no splatter issues with this",5
4049,"In theory,  this is a great idea. However, I quickly found that this is more of a hassle. First of all, it's huge, juggling a poopie diaper and this big clumsy plastic thing is too much. It is also very hard to get a good angle over the toilet, in addition to at the diaper to effectively spray the poop off. I find myself getting water everywhere anyways, wether iy is boucing off the sides, or i am catching the part of the spray pal that is over the seat instead of the toiley bowl. Then after you're done, you have this giant poop splattered thing that's dripping wet. There is really no good place to put it, even the wey bag you can buy for it, eventually you have to take it out again, and it's still covered in old poop. Unless you are not a parent,  (which you are if you are shopping for this) then you have a baby you need to tend to. This was so much of a hassle, I don't even use it.",1
4050,"Works great! Make sure if you are using pocket diapers to put the opening at the bottom. I made that mistake once haha! Nothing like a diaper filled with poopy water!",5
4051,"The clip is genius, the platter shield keeps everything in the toilet, as expected. I don't collapse it - we just drop it in the shower after uses before we get a chance to clean it properly. I'd like to think I am eco-consencious, but so far Lysol wipes have been the easiest to use to clean the shield. Sometimes I spray it with bac-out and hope the lime does it's thing. I've also been reading about ammonia then vinegar sprays to kill germs, so I might try that next. I say just buy this one and don't bother with making your own or buying the one that comes with the garment/diaper bag!",4
4052,"this is nice added protection during loud music at church or park concerts. My baby didn't pull these off of his head and he only wore for short periods of time &#62; 30 min once per week, so I wasn't concerned about any pressure on his soft scalp.",5
4053,"The chair itself is great, but my daughter hated the toys so we never used them. We started  using the chair with the insert, then removed it when she got too big. Now she's a year old and we take the seat to restaurants and sit it in the booth with us. She likes to sit in it and eat like a big girl rather than in a wooden high chair.",5
4054,"We tried a bunch of different pacifiers and these worked the best for our baby - he could keep them in his mouth a lot easier then the others we had. These are very lightweight and a good size especially for newborns.",5
4055,"If your little one hasn't accepted any other pacifier then try this one! We thought we were doomed when we could get out little one to take a pacifier but decided to try one last time...she loves it!!!",5
4056,"Best car seat!!! Did my research and we are very happy with the level of safety and comfort it provides for our baby.",5
4057,"Good car seat.  Comfortable and offers lots of protection.  I did not notice any problem with the belt or noticing it's too short.  As others mentioned, mesh pocket is useless.  I use 7-11 plastic cup in the mesh and place his sippy cup inside 7-11 cup.  I noticed that the chest buckle can slide down very easily where as with my Britax it's very secure.",4
4058,"Coming from Britax stuff this is even better. You can use this seat for SO many years, its simply worth the money. Love it.",5
4059,"While I completely love this seat I hate it at the same time! We've been using this seat for over a year now with my almost 3yr old 50lb 41&#34; daughter in the Sand color (which I might add isn't half bad). Before this seat we had the Prosport in Riley which had an issue and was replaced via Recaro.Now down to the basics:The tallest harness setting is a short 20&#34;The seat width is 14&#34; meaning 3 can be placed in a rowThe massive wings make for a nice head rest in sleeping childrenThe harness straps are SHORT, with a 50lb child they are on their very last inch of adjustment, we WILL grow out of the harness length before the height is met on this seat.The cover can be removed, its not as bad as it looks, and washed. Yes it holds weird stains and they do not come out.The latch system is great but again it can only be used in up to 50lbs then the belt MUST be used to secure the seat. When the belt is used to secure the seat in harness mode the child can feel the belt through the padding making about an inch gap.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, if you have a tall wide child steer clear of this seat and go get a Britax 90 harness booster instead it WILL last longer than this short seat.Again I love this seat but its just too short for our needs.Prosport to Performance differences: HERO pads, that is the only difference.",5
4060,"I really like the way this cloth diaper fits my DS. The snaps are well spaced and are good quality. The elastic and waterproof lining has held up to many many washings. The inserts that came with them are quite large, my DS is a toddler so that wasn't an issue for me, but maybe for someone who is using this for an infant. They are also very absorbent and thick. My only complaint is the lining that rests against my DS skin. The fleece started piling within the first week and is very rough now. Whenever we use this diaper his skin is always pinker than usual. Not diaper rash just more irritated. We use this as a back up diaper cover now.",3
4061,"It takes a really hard tug to get this off the tray.  Once it is on there I really don't worry about my toddler pulling it off.  It sticks to the bowl OK but the part between the rubber and the bowl does come off easier than the part off the tray.  If there is any bit of butter or oil, etc on it then it won't stick at all.  The plus side is you can attach the rubber part to other things like plates and suction them to the tray. The bowl is deep so less mess.  The lid locks well and twists so no leaking.  Too bad it doesn't come in fun colors.",4
4062,"We and our son love the Tommee Tippee bottles, they are very natural to a real nipple.  But we are tired of having to buy these replacement nipples which don't come with the required ring to attach it to the bottle.  I don't want to buy more bottles, just more nipples!",3
4063,"this is a very soft material teether, my daughter was able to grasp it without any difficulties. Since it is made of soft material, I do not have any worries about her hurting herself accidentally and it seems durable that it will not rip. My daughter is still beginning in her teething and does not need to chew on it constantly but she does seem to enjoy holding it in her hands.",4
4064,"We got this monitor for our new baby, and it has been really good so far. The screen is pretty clear, and I like how you can have multi views on the screen or zoom in on one screen. The sound works well. When the baby is quiet the sound is muted until a noise is made in the room, so it's not distracting during the night. I've been well pleased with the battery life. I keep our monitor plugged in during the night, but during my daughter's two naps and when I put her down at night before I go to bed it is unplugged and I never run out of battery.The only issue I had was that the screen messed up recently. There were little black and gray lines all over it so I could only use the sound. I immediately called Summer company, and they sent me a monitor to replace mine free of charge. If this were to happen again I would not be pleased... For this price I want it to last a while! But I understand that things happen with technology sometimes and the customer service rep I spoke to could not have been nicer!",4
4065,"When I installed my baby's car seat, I saw that was moving to much, like it was slipping on the seat. I started to look what can I do about it and found this! Worked just perfect! No more slipping!",5
4066,"I bough it basically because the baby seat against my leather seats would be making some noises which I hated, this one did the job...",5

4068,"I hesitated for some time before deciding to get a &#34;leash&#34; for my little girl- now 23 months old.She loves to explore our neighborhood with me, but doesn't always like to hold hands. I haven't used the lead/tether yet but I feel better knowing I have something to grab onto if she makes a mad dash toward danger.It also helps when we go to our local farmer's market. She hated being in the stroller because she couldn't see anything and I was nervous because the stroller keeps her at eye level to the dogs that a lot of people bring to the market as well. I don't hate dogs I just know that some people have illusions about the temperament of their pets, especially in sensory overload situations. I would just prefer to carry her in dense crowds and this product allows me the confidence to allow her some walking time but the ability to scoop her up if the need arises.We even use this for our trips to the park, it doesn't' limit her ability to play at all. We put a sippy cup, a fruit pouch, sunglasses, and a pacifier in her backpack and off we go!I was unsure if she would be willing to wear a backpack, but once she saw it, she was all about it. &#34;Mah backpa!&#34; Said exclaimed when I put it on her for the first time.I decided on this product over a conventional backpack because it has the chest strap. It is also not too bulky.We have been using this product for about 2 months now. I am a fan and would recommend it or something like it to a caregiver who wants the flexibility that I had outlined above.",5
4069,"I bought this for my 6 month old son, so that he could start sitting up in high chairs.  It sets up and is put away very easily.  We've washed it lots of times and it seems to hold up well.  I would recommend this to my mommy friends.  We've been using this for 3 months now with no problems.We use ours with the shopping cart too, but it doesn't fit all that well.  It's good enough for me, but it's pretty clear that it's not intended to be used that way.My only (tiny) complaint is that the holes for straps to go though are small, so it seems like I have to fight to push buckles through there every time I set it up.  Minor complaint, but something they could improve upon, I think.",5
4070,"These worked perfect for our 2011 Highlander.  It fits behind the front seats snug and I don't even notice the snaps anymore.  I like how it's sleek and wipes off easy with water.  No pockets is nice so we don't accumulate junk and saggy straps.  I'll be buying it again!",5
4071,"This Auto mirror has been a life savor for us. The music is nice and the lights are nice too. The remote is a wonderful feature to have too. Came in handy when we get stuck in traffic. Our son loves this.",5
4072,"Yes there are some annoying features but for the price I am very happy with this purchase.  Remembering to hit the button isn't that hard and you can turn it off from the front seat.  My only issue is I was expecting the fully charged batteries I put in to last more than a couple weeks but what can you do, car rides are so much better now!!!",4
4073,"Its a good product that can distract your kid if he or she is fussy, specially during the long road trips. The reason I gave 4 star is because you always have to press the power button before starting the music from the remote. So, if you are alone with the child and forgot to put on the power button, you wont be able to start the music on the way.",4
4074,"Nuk bottles and pacifiers are the ONLY brand my daughter likes. Easy to clean, I highly recommend trying them. Of course, the designs are cute.",5
4075,"i saw this bag n had to get it n I'm IN LOVE WITH IT its cute for me but still manly for my bf so when he's out with our daughter he's not complaining about looking like a female lol. it holds everything she needs n i took it on the plane when we travelled n it held a good set of stuff. my iPad my phone my huge purse our passports a 16oz water flask 3 baby bottles 2 sleepers 4 pampers 1 destine 2 formula containers 1 blanket 1 hoodie 1 hat 4 wash clothes n 4 bibs 2 toys skip hop wipes container 1 thermometer lets jus say it held alot n it fit under the airplane seat its great!!!!.",5
4076,"Do you NEED this? No. Sometimes I see it as just another thing to wash. Though it's simple design makes cleaning it a breeze. However, it does make things easier; I find I &#34;need&#34; it with some blends but not others. Not sure why that is. Either way, It's 4 bucks, so it really doesn't hurt to have on hand. If it cost more, I might only give it 3 stars, but considering the value I would say it's worth buying.",4
4077,"Purchased with filling station and this misplaced for a few weeks. Definitely easier using the funnel to fill versus spooning puree into the tube.",5
4078,"We're just at the very beginnings of the potty training stage, so I can't speak to the full use of this yet. However, so far it seems very well made, does not slip, toddler fits comfortable and with it being pretty much a solid plastic piece it's easy to clean.",4
4079,"My boy has no trouble getting onto and off the Pourty Flexi-Fit Toilet Trainer and seems comfortable using it. Plus, the splash guard does a good job preventing spills. All in all, the trainer works well but not exactly as stated. When setting up the Pourty Flexi-Fit Toilet Trainer you are suppose to adjust the prongs to be a little further in from the toilet seat edge. This means to put the trainer on the toilet seat you must squeeze the rear of the trainer in slightly. The trainer then stays securely in place because the prongs are pushing against the edge of the toilet seat. However, when I adjust the prongs to be a little further in from the toilet seat edge the rear of the trainer bows up. As a result, I adjusted the prongs on the trainer to be flush with the toilet seat. Setting it up this way, the trainer does wiggle a little but is easy to pull off and put back in place because it just lifts up when taking it off and slides down when putting it back, no flexing necessary. I would have preferred the toilet trainer work as described so it would be very secure on the toilet seat. Still, I'm happy with the purchase as it looks nice, does a good enough job staying in place, and my child has no problem using it.",4
4080,"I like the concept, but this product did not fit over my standard deadbolt. I was bummed and I'm still on the hunt for something to keep my child from unlocking the front door.",2
4081,"I can't review a nursing pillow without mentioning Boppy which has been around for 25 years and always worked for me. They are comfortable, with easy to remove and clean covers and grow with your baby. That being said the Born Free Bliss Nursing Pillow lacks almost all of those features. It's design is actually a bit uncomfortable especially if you are a petite person, the cover while easy to clean isn't the easiest to remove or put on and it really isn't a pillow that will grow with your child as it's meant solely as a nursing pillow. Overall I can't recommend this over what is already available, but if you aren't a fan of Boppy Pillows then maybe this is for you.",2
4082,"My youngest sister just had her first baby.  She had registered for a Boppy and when I saw this I thought it looked like a good alternative!  I used a Boppy with my now 6 year old, possibly even with my 15 year old, too, but I could never seem to get just the right angle for feeding with it.  I thought this one seemed like it would be easier so I took it over to her house the first time I went over after the baby was born.  She decided to nurse the baby and when I got there she was trying to nurse using the Boppy under the baby and was having a hard time. (lots of memories came back to me! LOL)  I had already taken this out of the package, washed the cover and it was all put together.  I gave it to her and she put it on her lap in place of the Boppy.It seemed like it was much easier for her to nurse without having to hunch over.  She's tall, 5'9&#34;, and it put the baby right up at the same level as her breast so that she didn't have to put stress on her back.  She said she didn't like the newborn mat because it was just too hard of a surface so we took that off after she was done.  On the next feeding she said it felt much better without the newborn mat.I live out of state so I stayed with her for a couple of days.  I got to feed the baby with a bottle and used the Born Free as well.  She's taller than I am so it felt a little high for me but we took the bottom part off and then it was at the perfect height for me.I definitely like this better than a Boppy for feeding and so does she.  It would be perfect if it weren't so expensive and came with a cover!",4
4083,"I really, REALLY wanted to love this pillow. The concept is ingenious and being primarily a Boppy user, I was thrilled with the design of the top layer, which is basically flat and has a lip on the outer edge. My two month old son is just now starting to figure out how to roll over and I'm always nervous about the possibility that he could potentially roll right off of my Boppy so the idea of there being a lip there to help prevent an accidental roll had me excited. Unfortunately this pillow left a lot to be desired.Let me start by saying that I'm not a small woman. I'm nearly 6' tall and have a long torso. With that said, this pillow is massive. Granted the weight of the baby sinks it down some but not nearly enough for a comfortable breastfeeding position. The pillow and right height mat stand about 11&#34; tall off the lap. With the pillow boost it's more like 15&#34;. I'm used to using a Boppy pillow which stands about 6&#34; tall so in comparison this thing is just massive to me. Perhaps if I hadn't already been used to the Boppy I would have been more receptive to its size but it is what it is. With the Boppy being the most popular breastfeeding pillow out there I'm sure I'm not alone in my opinion.The product is well made and for that I give it 3 stars but the size is a deal breaker for me and I cannot recommend it. It's really a shame as it has so much potential.",3
4084,"I gave this to my sister as a gift, and she loves it. The design supports her daughter well, and doesn't put too much pressure on my sister's legs. The design is quite ergonomic. It's also nice that the pillow can be adjusted to match Zoey's growth. It's three pillows in one. She highly recommends it to other moms who are nursing.",4
4085,"I unfortunately received this not knowing that it only fits the born free nursing pillow. I am using it on my regular nursing pillow and the spot pattern fits just fine. It's soft enough, and cool to the touch. The blue piece must only fit the born free nursing pillow so I just don't use. FYI buy the nursing pillow that's suppose to come with this.",4
4086,"This cover is actually two pieces that you put on separately.  They only cover the top and surrounding parts of the nursing pillow, not the bottom.  The material is like a cheap pillowcase, not all all soft and very thin. Overall I'm not a huge fan of this cover other than the cute dot design, but because the Born Free Bliss Pillow is unique you will need one of these covers specially made for it.",3
4087,"I love the born free bliss nursing pillow, but the one thing I didn't love is that despite the high price tag, it didn't come with any kind of a slip cover it all. Especially considering that the hard newborn mat seems like it would not go through the wash very gracefully, I was dismayed to find that I would need to put a blanket over the top of the pillow every time I used it.This cover solves all of that. The cover is easy to put on and take off, uses Velcro, so it's a snap to take off, wash, and put back on quickly, even when sleep deprived. This is in stark contrast to the cover I have for the my brest friend nursing pillow, which takes ages to get on and off.It's cute, and stylish, and I appreciate that it is unisex.The only thing is that I wish the cover were just a little bit thicker material. If your little one falls asleep and drools milk out the side of his mouth, even a small quantity such as a half teaspoon of milk would soak right through the pillow case cover and into the pillow below.",5
4088,"This pillow cover is so cute, works for either gender, is easy to put on (and take off!) and are machine washable!  I don't know what more you could ask for in a cover for a nursing pillow. (except maybe a little lower price) If you're buying the Born Free Nursing Pillow for someone who doesn't know the gender of the baby yet this one is great!",5
4089,"This cover is really cute and fits the Born Free Bliss pillow perfectly. The material is soft and I love that the colors are gender neutral. All in all a great product!",5
4090,"I ordered the pillow and case for my sister. When they were delivered, I drove over and put the case of her. Moms love how easy it is to put on? Are you kidding me? I thought the seams were going to rip from how tight the cover is. It's a cool color layout. But when putting on, it is like trying to fit into a pair of skinny jeans fresh out of the dryer. A few other comments mentioned that the material is stiff, which I agree. But it does soften after washing, especially if you use a good fabric softener. At the end of the day it is a good cover, just don't expect it to slip right on like I did.",3
4091,"I absolutely hate it.  I have used the original and new Boppy Nursing Pillows as well as the Mombo Nursing Pillow and this pillow cover is the most horrid I've felt.  It's like they chose the cheapest quality cotton to make this cover out of.  I've bought cheap cotton bandanas at the dollar store which were softer than this material.  True, it gets softer after a wash - but not soft enough....and you'd have to wash it a lot.  Then it shrinks.  It's just completely unacceptable.  When was nursing my newborn, skin to skin is very important so my infant and I are topless.  Then the nursing pillow is right up against your bare belly and the baby is laying on top of it.  Your breasts are in contact with the pillow too.  This is a time for softness and cuddles, plus, you'll be spending hours upon hours like this - you want the softest, most comfortable pillow possible!  The Boppy pillow uses cotton and that one is softer than this.  I just can say enough how completely put off with the feel of this fabric.  I do NOT recommend.",1
4092,"This body pillow is as it appears on the Amazon web page. It is almost circular at one end and curved at the other. While it can be stretched a little it retains that form.As a result it would work well as a feeding pillow and toddler pillow. It also works as a body pillow knowing that, as the picture on the web page shows, the pillow will wrap around a person&#8217;s body.There are may different types of body pillows. This is made for women who are pregnant and just looking at it, and the pictures on this page, explains why.It is made of quality material that is made to last. I felt comfortable resting my head on the pillow and my legs on the pillow as well.It has a cover on it that is washable.  Other covers can be purchased as well but you can use the one that comes with this body pillow.",4
4093,"I have used body pillows with all 4 pregnancies and this fits right on just like the last. At first I wasn't sure the how tie strings would look, but actually they cover up the pillow nicely and make it easy to put on. Material is soft as well.",5
4094,"This fits easily over the Comfortfit Body Pillow. The ties hold it in place. The color is nice and it washes well.Some pillow covers can be hard to put on.  This is easy to put on over the body pillow.  The ties hold it in place and it feels snug. The color is nice and relaxing and good for a bedroom.It is made of cotton and washes well. I would not call it soft but it is not stiff either. I think washing will make it softer. It looks like it will hold up well for many washes.",4
4095,"This is the seat for grandmas car, so its not the primary car seat. We have Chicco next fits for our (parents ) car, but Chicco is expensive especially for occasional use. My kid is now 24 mos and this fits them much better than when they were younger (this car seat got some use at 10mos and 16 mos- back then their head would flop forward when they were sleeping-- this is in the forward facing position) However now it appears to be a comfy ride. Do shop around- I found this same seat on Walmart.com for $185",4
4096,"The first time I ordered it they sent the wrong parts but amazon customer service fixed it for me in 48 hours! Super happy about that. It was easy to assemble and holds my graco car seat pretty securely. It's not as smooth as the other baby jogger products but it works efficiently.",4
4097,"The cheap plastic buckle on the strap snapped on the second use. I still use it carefully. It does fit my Graco Snugride.",2
4098,"I ordered this stroller through BBB and received it the other day. During assembly, I noticed that the harness strap holder behind the removable seat pad had not been sewn on completely-for one of the most expensive umbrella strollers out there, you would think that this type of manufacturing defect would not exist. Apparently you don't always get what you pay for, and that's why I would deduct one star from this rating.Overall, I love this stroller-it IS lightweight, especially compared to our other stroller which is a Bob Revolution SE. Here is what I love about this:-One handed recline-easily adjustable footrest-easy fold with safety mechanism built into the release-sturdy wheels, although I have yet to really test them out on non-smooth surfaces-large canopy, largest I've seen and by far the best I've seen on an umbrella stroller-CARRYING STRAP-I think this should be a standard on ALL umbrella strollers!-Comfy, padded seat that is stain resistant (great for parents like me with babies who spit up a lot!)-easy assembly-just pop the canopy, front wheels and cup holder and you're good to go!Some reviewers have complained about how &#34;cheap&#34; the umbrella feels-this is probably because it is incredibly light for an umbrella stroller that reclines. If you want a sturdier feeling stroller, you probably don't want to get any umbrella stroller whatsoever b/c they will ALL feel &#34;cheap&#34; to you. I chose this over many others I researched mostly because of the lightness of the stroller, weight capacity, large UV canopy, one handed almost flat recline, and carrying strap. I don't think it feels cheap at all, especially compared to other umbrella strollers.On a different note, I got the Ani color-it is a much brighter orange in person than it is in the photos.",4
4099,"This installation of this seat is one of the biggest reasons I chose it. I love how quick, simple, and easy it is to install. The straps were a little hard to tighten at first, but it's getting easier the more we use the seat. My son loves his seat and has never complained about sitting in it.",5
4100,"This is my second car seat purchase and I bought it for my younger children who had outgrown the rear-facing models. Before that I had used a kiddy (a brand that is more popular in Europa) car seat but after getting used to this one I regret purchasing the kiddy one. Let me tell you why:1- Compared to that model this one offers a lot more security. At least I feel that way. Kiddy model are secured by the seat belt only and have no other strains to immobilize the car seat as well as the child. Here 5 point harness which does a great job for both of my kids (3.5 and 1.5 years old) and seat belt works in parallel. You use the seat belt to immobilize the car seat and the harness to secure the child. Besides that there are two other straps that click at various hooks to make sure it does not move no matter what happens. (One of the straps called versa thether is for the booster mode and the other is for the older child mode) This design is non existent in my other car seat causing the seat move sideways annoyingly.2- This harness is designed in a way that you need to unlock it from two separate points to release the child which is not time consuming for the parents but so far not possible for my young children to release themselves. The other model is secured using regular seat belt buckle and whenever we move my son to that one he manages to get himself out within minutes. I know that when he outgrows the booster mode we will have to use a similar design in this car seat as well but by that time, he will probably have better understanding of the importance of being on a car seat through out the journey. Now it is the problem since he has the motor skill maturation but not the required reasoning ability.3- This one is much heavier, I can say double the weight, which may be annoying when you have to move it around (like in airports) but makes you feel your child is safer since it is heavier due to metal construction that is probably not existent in the other model. However let me tell you one thing: Heavier does not mean bulkier for this model. It may be a little bigger but the difference would be no more than half inches so not noticeable at all...4- Cup holder is a plus. Not because the little one is a coffee addict but it is good for sippy cups and some juices as well as pet water bottles.Besides those obvious differences I can say that both car seats I own have good fabric. Easy to clean by wiping and does not cause sweating a lot. Additionally, both models are comfortable for the kid and have recline positions (but I have to say that kiddy offers a more comfortable recline compared to rather limited ability of this model) for long journey naps but still the head nodding is a problem for both. You may try supportive pillows for that.One concern is that the side cushions that keep the head in place are made of foam and my son managed to break one of them. Yet, due to the support of the thick clothing above, it stays in place not causing a loss of function but it could have been designed better. Another minor problem is that you can not get it flat ( at least I could not) which was something you can do with my other model and it might be necessary when you need to store it or transport is as a luggage.Price-wise despite it is a lot more superior than my other model, I can say it is slightly cheaper and amazon offers a good price with free prime shipping compared to other vendors. My conclusion is that it is strong, stylish, affordable and easy to install (easy to adjust the size between two children too) So far it has met my expectations and If I ever need to buy another car seat, this brand will be my first choice, and off course amazon too...",5
4101,"This seat is a beast.  It is heavy!!  I guess this could be considered a &#34;con,&#34; but I like it - it makes the seat feel very sturdy.  Install in my 2004 Prius was a breeze.  I'd read reviews from car seat techs, and this seat got a big thumbs up for ease of install - apparently it is very hard to install wrong, whereas other seats can be tricky to install correctly.I asked my 4yo if it felt different than his last seat (a Britax Marathon), and he said it was softer.  (??)  Maybe the seat has more padding.  He loves the arm rests and the bright red color.  I wish Britax made this seat in green also (like the Pioneer).He's a very tall kid, and the seat can't be fully extended to the tallest setting in the Prius - it hits the top of the car.  But, the shoulder straps are about 2&#34; above his shoulders at the highest it can go, which I'm guessing will buy us another couple years in harness-mode.  At that point, he will be 6 or so and able to sit properly in booster-mode.",5
4102,"Really like this car seat so far.  Very heavy!  At first our 4 year old didn't seem to be able to sleep in it, but we figured out it wasn't reclined.",5
4103,"This seat looks huge when you take it out of the box.  My daughter sat in it on our living room floor and it looked as if she was seated in a rocket ship embarking on a deep space mission!  When measured it isn't much wider than the Roundabout 55 which is what it's replacing.  The fabric and color are the signature Britax.  The installation was quite easy.  The price is hefty ; the peace of mind it offers outweighs the cost.  Neither of our vehicles have side airbags.  No issues with the harness and a snug fit as other reviews have stated.  Fits in a 2009 Honda Accord and a 2000 Jeep Cherokee.  The second gender specific print I've ever purchased in child equipment - great color!",5
4104,"When I got these I was pleasantly surprised to see a different design. They sent the newer version with race cars and a neat &#34;arctic&#34; lining that is suppose to help with insulation. Race cars are a huge hit in our house so the change up was fine with me, just be aware you may not receive the same picture on your cups as the ones in the pic.Some people have complained about paint coming off and I haven't had that issue, maybe they fixed it with the new race car version, or my dishwasher is gentler. I will update this review if the paint starts to wear off at some point, as that was my major hesitation with ordering these.",5
4105,"this seems to be the only cup my 6 month old daughter can kind of catch on to. (exclusively breast fed) doesn't seem to leak so far. like that it has the lid and a stopper you can put inside for travel.",5
4106,"Love the detachable handles - makes cleaning and heating up so much easier!  These are the closest I could find to a bottle, so perfect for transitioning.  These are the third kind we tried, and the only ones my daughter will even attempt to use!",5
4107,"I got the ones without the handle first, but my kid is apparently super lazy and couldn't be bothered to hold them up. These make it much easier for him. Nothing like being an enabler, huh?",4
4108,"But I decided to give my son the straw cup instead (as ped suggested) although he really loved this bottle.",5
4109,"We have two of these for our leather seats. Highly recommend. Keeps entire seat protected. Very durable. Easy to clean.",5
4110,"positive1. lighter than previous Safety 1st 65 LX convertible seat (this has been discontinued)2. snug and head adjustment easy to adjust3. sturdy... but......(see negative)negative:1. doesn't recline enough unlike the safety 1st 65 lx where that car seat had 3 different positions of reclining the seat. this doesn't. and the reclining adjustment is on the back side instead of a pull handle on the front on the previous model mentioned.2. the car seat is sturdy all around, but one part i noticed that seems to be cheaper in material is the adjustment handles on the head adjustment.3. the strap clip (with he red button) can be adjusted in 3 different positions but it seems like the farthest position you can adjust it to doesn't give enough room because i have the trouble of clipping the straps and making sure that i don't pinch my son's leg with it.over all, the car seat is good. hopefully it doesn't need to be put to the test in real life. (crossing my fingers)",4
4111,"We got the Grace SnugRide click connect travel system when our son was born.  It came with the stroller, carrier and one base and has been great so far..  The latch system (in most cars) makes moving the base so easy that you may be able to spend the $50 for an extra base on other things.  We ordered th second base becuase one of our cars is difficult to reach the latch ancohors, but if you are primarily going to use one car for baby transport, I'd skip the second base.",5
4112,"Pros:  Easy to install.  Modern vehicles have anchors buried between the cushions in the back seat, so you don't have to fool with seatbelts, but you CAN still use a seatbelt to install this product if necessary.  Carseat snaps into place very securely with an audible &#34;click&#34; that lets you know it's secure.Cons:  Removal of this product... Once you know what you're doing it's easy, but I was cussing at this thing because I needed to remove it to place a mat underneath, and I couldn't get the blasted strap loose.  There's a button that you squeeze, and if you tighten the strap super tight like I did, you can't squeeze this button by hand.  Or at least I couldn't (6'3&#34; 270lb fairly strong male speaking here...)  I had to get a pair of pliers.  The strap released without issue upon using pliers, so this isn't even enough to remove a star, in my book.  The extreme safety I felt when I installed these trumps the strap being stubborn on my first attempt at removal.Other Thoughts:  Purchased this to replace the SnugRide Classic connect that we purchase accidentally.  (Our stroller was compatible with BOTH Click and Classic connect, and lead us to mistakenly believe the carseat bases were universal as well.)Technically you DON'T need this base.  Most carseats have the option of still being secured with a seatbelt, and the SnugRide Click connect definitely is one of those.  This product makes putting baby in and taking baby out of the car INCREDIBLY easy, and I would recommend that everyone purchase one of these for every vehicle.Also, keep in mind that until products are used multiple times (broken in) some things could feel &#34;stiff&#34;.  I surmise that my difficulty in depressing the button to release the strap that holds this product securely to the seat in the back was a result of how tight I made the strap, and due to the fact that the button had never been used, and was &#34;sticky&#34;.",5
4113,"This is extremely soft and the color is beautiful.  My baby loves to feel it while being changed.  Nice raised dot pattern on it too:)Personally I would recommend this changing pad cover to everyone!!It can be washed with like colors and cold water.  It does not bleed, you can tumble dry however, I prefer line drying because it would preserve the original texture and color.",5
4114,"My daughter leaks in these every time, they are just a poor fit for her.  They are also the bulkiest diapers in my diaper stash, which makes the fact that they leak even worse.  I also have a really hard time snapping the snaps, they are difficult unless you're Hercules......not fun with a screaming baby in the middle of the night.  They also leak through the PUL itself.",2
4115,"keeps my daughter safe when I'm occupied while the product gives her ability to move around.  My first floor is hardwood only hence not sure if it works on carpet.",5
4116,"I would not suggest this until babies get older, my 12 week old won't take because the nipple is to long for her.",1
4117,"I always love Dr. Brown things as they are a step above the rest. Very nice and well made...Nice colors too.",5
4118,"This is a nice addition for toddler potty-training.  With her step-stool, by daughter is able to easily and independently push or pull on to turn the faucet on and off.  As bonus, she can only access the cold water, reducing the change that she'll accidentally burn herself.Note that this installs easily on a standard bathroom or kitchen faucet that has 2 levers that you pull toward you or push away (commonly called a wide-apart or wide-spread).  Has foam inside to help grip even on a contoured handle.",4

4120,"every baby likes something different.  some like bouncing, some like swing motion, some like vibrations...this is nice because it bounces automatically on it's own.  but i only gave it 3 stars because there is no 'vibrate' feature.it would have been so easy for them to add a 'vibrate' feature to this and make this a bouncer/vibration combo.  so if your baby isn't crazy about the bouncer,  you could try the vibrate feature.if i had to do it over again, i would look for one that has both 'bounce' feature, plus 'vibrate' feature.",3
4121,"I have the regular ergo baby carrier so I was thrilled to get this more summer friendly mesh lined carrier.  I'll also note I've had a Bjorn carrier and I tried the Moby wrap (or really long piece of fabric).This ergo carrier is slightly different than the regular ergo mostly the material and the front feels more like wearing a backpack on your stomach than the original.  I'm not saying that's bad, it just feels that way to me.  Like the regular Ergo, my favorite thing about this carrier is the waist belt support.  It really takes a load off my back and shifts the baby's weight.  What a relief.  I found these ergo carriers to be much more supportive of me than the Bjorn with no waist strap.  All the weight pulls on my shoulders and I'd be sore quickly.Also with the regular ergo and this one, I can fasten the one fastener between my shoulder blades by myself.  Yes, it's always easier to have someone else help with the fastener here, but I go to Costco and everywhere else alone and do it with one hand.  Or I put the baby in the carrier while in the car, so I can do it while seated.  I have not worn baby on my back so sorry no report there although as he grows I will try it.Both Ergos has a little nook where baby's butt fits into perfectly and then his legs are spread wide across my belly.  I always check him for comfort and move his legs around to make sure he's cozy.  He's never complained, I just want to make sure I don't cut off his circulation.  It took me a while to get used to this as the Bjorn carriers do not keep their legs spread.  The alternative is baby's legs just hang in Bjorn and in the Ergo they are supported.  I don't know which is better for baby, so that's up to you moms.I love the mesh lining on this one as my baby runs hot.  We lasted through Sea World, San Diego Zoo, and Universal Studios without him over heating on three hot days.  My baby loves to sleep in this thing.I also have an easier time nursing in the Ergos, while it took more maneuvering for me in the Bjorn.  And the shade features are awesome.Overall, I'm super happy with this Ergo baby carrier and I will purchase for expecting friends if I like them A LOT because they are expensive.  But for me, my back is worth it and my baby is definitely worth it.And just for additional comparison, I used the Moby when my baby was first born until he grew into the Ergo (he's little so six months).  I quickly grew tired on unraveling those endless pieces of fabric and wrapping them around my body and then trying to get the right snugness for baby.  What a pain!  I prefer having the Ergo carrier to strap on and go.  So much easier.",5
4122,"We own 3 different baby carriers. The original Babybjorn, Kelty 2.0 child carrier and the Ergobaby. They are all great carriers with its own merits. I love the Erogo the most!The Bjorn is a workhorse from the very start.  Both of my kids used it extensively. So definitely got my money's worth out of it and after 3.5 years, it's still in very good condition. One of my biggest complaints about the Bjorn is its too warm for hot weather.This Ergobaby performance carrier solved this problem. It is light and has breethable mesh. It is different in terms of design, so takes me a few tries to get used to it. But now I love it! It is also very easy on my back and I love the nap hood which protects the baby from the sun. I am going to take it with us to Costa Rica and use it entensively.The Kelty is for the hardcore outdoor folks. It's awesome, but it takes up much space and we don't use it as often as we like to.So if you can only own one carrier, I will go with the Ergo.",5
4123,"I have one of the first generation Ergos and this is much improved.  The feel of it is much more ergonomic - the straps curve to fit your body better, they have much softer cushions, and the way the chest strap slides is much smoother.  I also love the pocket for the hood - it's perfect, and the elastic bands to wrap around excess straps is great.  There's nothing dangling off of it like previous versions.  The mesh is great on hot days and makes hiking with little ones a lot more comfortable.  The Ergo is my favorite baby carrier of all time and this version definitely does not disappoint!",5
4124,"I love using the Ergo with my son, but I could never get the infant insert to work in a way that made it worth it. Prior to being able to use this at 3-4 months, we found the Moby the best and easiest option.I've used the more traditional Ergo and the Performance. I think the differences are that the traditional one is warmer/thicker, and slightly less expensive and there are also obvious aesthetic differences. All of that is to say, that if you can afford it the Performance seems to have all the benefits of the traditional Ergo, plus it doesn't get as warm for baby or person wearing baby.In terms of comparison to other carriers, it is true that you cannot wear baby facing out in this one. There is some question as to how good that is for babies to face out, but if you want that option, the Ergo is not great for that. But you can do a front carry, back carry and side carry. It took one or two tries to get the hang of getting the Ergo on and off, and after a short amount of practice it was easy to back carry my infant myself without help getting him on or off.It fit me well, but it was clearly not as comfortable for a bigger male to use this. My son's dad preferred the Moby because of the way it fit and its adjustability.My child is too little to need the things that protect the ergo and allow them to chew on the side of it, but if I had another infant, I would get the little things that protect the straps that they will inevitably chew on.Overall, this was and remains my go-to carrier. Easy to get on and off, fits well, does not cause sore shoulders or back, and versatile.",5
4125,"I love to wear my baby out at the park, hiking, and running errands. I don't feel comfortable doing that in very warm weather because they just get so hot! this is the perfect solution to that problem. I wore my 5 month old at the park multiple times for over an hour in this carrier and she kept much cooler because of the mesh opening. She was comfortable and fell asleep while I chased my toddler around. We like to hike in the summertime and this will be great for that purpose as well, since it will keep her cool. The carrier is comfortable and works well with the infant insert. Overall a great option for baby wearing in warm conditions.",5
4126,"I was really excited about the mesh aspect of this Ergobaby carrier.  I only used a baby Bjorn with my first baby but I was looking for something that would work while my new baby gained weight.  Also, with having two children I needed something that I could wear for longer periods of time.  Having to chase after a toddler makes it necessary to have my hands free.This carrier is really light-weight and well-made. I like the thoughtfulness of the elastic bands that are provided on the carrier to keep the extra strap material from dangling and looking sloppy.  Another bonus is the sleep/sun cover that is attached.  I know that the cover wasn't designed for this but I love that it keeps people from touching my baby's face or hands.  I can just tuck the baby away in here in a crowd and all that people touch is the feet.  The clips on this carrier can stay attached with the straps loosened that are then simply tightened once the baby is positioned. This is more convenient than carriers whose straps fully detach and need to be reattached with each use.  The mesh keeps the baby and I both cool and comfortable.",5
4127,"I have to admit the Baby Bjorn is a little more comfortable overall for a shorty, but this is SO much better ergonomically for your baby (back and especially hips).This is made exceptionally well! I like that it has a very thick support around the waist and arm straps.. and the hood is awesome for when your baby won't sleep and you need to decrease stimulation.. or when you're on a walk and the sun is beating down (the material is breathable so baby won't get too hot).. The storage compartment has thinner material so i wouldn't recommend putting a more than a couple keys, burprag, and a moneyclip or a few credit cards in it...but just pack it accordingly because it rests up against your baby. I got one for myself and my husband wore it all the time.. so for Mothers Day he got me a new, pretty blue one! Now we each have one to trek around with our twins..A few complaints:I'm 5'3&#34; and large chested and to fit my baby in comfortably, the arm strap adjustments hit me just under the backside of my armpit to where it rubs a bit. I found wearing thicker cotton clothing with full sleeves helps tremendously (obviously its worse with tank tops or slinky fabrics). Also, being large chested pulls the strap behind the neck a bit too much to where it rubs a bit.. more my problem than most I think though!This carrier is wonderful. Recommend it!",4
4128,"For years now I've heard many people rave about their Ergo carriers and I wondered if they were really as awesome as people make them out to be.  I've used a Bjorn carrier with my last three babies and have been so happy with my Bjorn--particularly the ease of use, and how happy my babies are while in the carrier.  I have lumbar back problems and have always found the Bjorn to be comfortable up until my babies hit the 16-18lb range.When I took this carrier out of the box the first thing I noticed was the nice fabric quality.  The carrier is a nice airy mesh that should be comfortable for both parent and baby during the summer months, provided the baby doesn't need the newborn insert.  With the newborn insert this carrier will just be way too warm.I found this carrier to be both complicated and uncomfortable to use.  It takes longer just to put it on without even having the baby loaded in it yet, than it does for me to put on my Bjorn carrier and load my baby into it.  Once I had the Ergo carrier on and the baby in it I found it to be on the uncomfortable side.  There's no way I could see myself wearing this carrier for a long outing.  It might be ok for a quick trip to the store, but since putting it on and loading the baby into it takes more than a few minutes, I just don't see it being practical for us.I think with regards to carriers like this it all boils down to personal preference.  My suggestion is to give the carrier a test run to see how you and your baby like it before settling on one type of carrier over another.",2
4129,"I'm generally not a baby wearer.  I had a K'tan Breeze when my son was an infant, and as much as he enjoyed it and it freed up my hands to do things around the house, it used to make me sweat like crazy.  A friend gave us a Bjorn that we basically never use because of all the horror stories with the positioning and letting babies legs dangle.  My husband is actually the one who was most interested in using the Bjorn - so I jumped at the chance to get this Ergo - since I hear so many good things about it.  I will say - it is comfortable to wear - and the baby seems to think so as well.  I still sweat when I have it on, but I assume that just comes with the territory.  Having something like this is ideal if you're going to be walking around somewhere all day.  Babies get restless in their strollers and sometimes just want to be close to mommy and daddy - but rather than break your back, this does the trick.  Baby wearing still isn't really my thing, but I definitely recommend an Ergobaby carrier over any other brand.  (Although the K'Tan was good when he was a newborn).",4
4130,"This carrier is mostly mesh. The straps are padded well, and the waistband is padded well. The mesh is more of a foam/mesh and feels very sturdy. This easily held my 20 lb. 11 month old with room to grow. The hood is sewn into the pouch, like other Ergos. The back strap slides up and down much more easily than a standard Ergo. This carrier is ridiculously comfortable for wearer and baby. The neck scoop is kind of high and not adjustable, so they won't be able to put their arms over until they are a toddler. The base of the carrier is wide enough to give baby a good wide seat with legs properly bent.My only complaint is that the outer grey fabric is super soft and wonderful feeling, but the fabric inside against the baby is the rougher mesh all the way around. I wish the super soft fabric was around the inside edges, instead of the rough mesh. The baby doesn't seem to mind at all, even in a onesie with his skin against it.",5
4131,"I've thought about getting an ergo for some time now, but couldn't ever pull the trigger.  We're headed to camp and even though my two year old is a little big to be carried around (he's 36 pounds), I thought this might be good if we're doing a lot of walking or if I need him to stay close.  This carrier is super easy to put on and the baby/toddler in.  I usually use a Moby (when the kids were younger), so that took a little wrangling!  This was a breeze.. less than a minute to get situated (and it was my first time with an Ergo).  It was very comfortable too, even with a hefty toddler in two.  I know you're not supposed to use it as a back carrier, but I just wanted to give it a try, but I can see how it doesn't work.  It doesn't have the same ergonomics and the upper strap cuts right across your neck.  Oh well, front carrying works for me!",5
4132,"This carrier has mesh which makes it so much more comfortable for summer.  I am enjoying having multiple options for placement of my daughter.  This really helps in getting certain chores done.  Worthwhile investment for babies that are over four months old.",5
4133,"The Ergobaby Performance Baby Carrier has taken the number one spot from Bjorn as our #1 &#34;go to&#34; baby carrier in the house. It's all about the mesh!The number one complaint about the baby bjorn has been that it gets stuffy and very hot for baby after a bit of use in the summer months.  Long walks are cut short with the Bjorn.  However, the Ergobaby is open, airy and breathable with it's mesh design. Comfortable and sturdy for both baby and parent. It's so good, seriously!The small pockets for cellphone or change is also a very nice feature. Loved it!Very highly recommended!",5
4134,"I have used the Ergo Sport more than this Performance model, and they each have their ups and downs. Sport has wider straps, which are potentially more comfortable. It also accommodates a wide range of parent heights. So if you are on the taller side, the Sport model may be a better pick.I am not, so I personally prefer this Performance model. My shoulders are a litle too narrow for the Sport to not feel a bit awkward: it was comfortable, but I felt a little eaten up by it. The Performance straps are smoother and sleeker, somehow. The Performance also has a more usable storage pocket, which is great if you need to keep your phone handy.The Performance model is also clearly ventilated: the white fabric is a mesh. The Sport model has a breathable cotton/poly blend, but it's not a mesh. Living in Texas, everything that can keep temperatures down is very welcome.The Ergos are both awesome at keeping the baby comfortably in place while you tend to your business (for me, usually it was for shopping trips). I recommend watching the Ergo videos on Youtube to learn how to use them; it was much easier for me than written instructions. I have front and side carried, haven't tried to back carry. I don't use the carrier now that my son walks, but I did try front carrying him at his current 28 lbs to see how comfortable it was: very. I was surprised.I will say, I did not like using Ergos with the infant insert. It is easy to use, but I found it bulky and very hot. I ended up using a Babybjorn until he was big enough to skip the insert. Ergo is much more comfrotable on my back, but he was still prettty small and I preferred a little achiness to both of us soaking in sweat.In sum: Ergo's are awesome, and unless you're very tall, this model is a great pick. It's more &#34;performance&#34;-looking (tech fabric. mesh, etc.) than the classic Ergo, which is cotton and more crunchy looking, so it may come down to aesthetic choices. They are all more similar than not.",4
4135,"My wife was concerned that our Beco Gemini carrier would be too warm in the summer months for both mom and baby, so she was excited about the mesh aspect of this Ergobaby carrier. Here are some considerations she outlined that hopefully help you as you evaluate different models:Materials &#8211; This carrier is really light-weight and well-made. The straps and clips are sturdy. The clips don&#8217;t have safety latches, so if that&#8217;s important to you, keep that in mind. Bonus points for the elastic bands that are provided on the carrier to keep the extra strap material from dangling and looking sloppy.Weight distribution &#8211; Your shoulders bear the full weight load in this carrier. I have a rather long torso and the waist belt sits too high to really provide additional support. After multiple wears, my shoulders are getting less fatigued but I didn&#8217;t experience any shoulder fatigue (even on 3+ hr hikes) with my Beco Gemini whose hip belt is more like a hiking &#8216;day pack&#8217; style with straps that crisscross for more weight spread.Baby&#8217;s comfort &#8211; Although my baby has had experience with other carriers, she did not fuss at all in this one even from the first try. My 14lb / 5 month-old baby feels a little &#8216;small&#8217; for this carrier and her legs seem spread wider than I'd like. With all carriers, you should be vigilant to be sure baby&#8217;s circulation is not impeded. I did have to adjust my little one during the first few uses for her legs and feet to stay their natural color. Also, the top of the carrier hits my baby&#8217;s neck just a little higher than I&#8217;d like, but did not chafe. As she gets older that will be less of a concern. Another bonus is the sleep/sun cover that is attached and always with you and sort of serves as neck support/quasi-pillow for the baby when put away.Use of use/putting on &#8211; The clips on this carrier can stay attached with the straps loosened that are then simply tightened once the baby is positioned. This is more convenient than carriers whose straps fully detach and need to be reattached with each use.Variable positions &#8211; The carrier instructions explicitly state to use only chest-facing, side, or back positions not front-facing. My little one really loves looking out at the world and seems to crook her head a bit in order to see things out of this carrier when chest-facing. She's not old enough for the back wearing and I am not comfortable to try that position without additional help.I'm hoping to increase this carrier's use throughout the summer, if my shoulders can hold up.",3
4136,"My wife absolutely loves this Ergobaby Performance carrier as it can be worn on the back, the front and the hips. We were using the Baby Bjorn carrier and while we like it a lot, my wife found it difficult to do her chores when carrying our little one on her back. We searched some time for a sturdy hip carrier but no carrier comes close.Now she like using the hip position more than the back or the front position, and when she gets tired, she just switches over to the back (or the front).This carrier is very well made and very sturdy, plus it has mesh fabric which is fantastic as my wife (and baby) found the carrier to be much cooler than the thicker padded Baby Bjorn.Now that its summer, we will most definitely be using this mesh-fabric carrier more often then our current Baby Bjorn which is made of cotton.",5
4137,"Goes perfectly with my nursery for my twins. It is so soft and washes easily. Even after many washes it still looks brand new.",5
4138,"We bought this as a spare / travel monitor and so far its worked out great.  I was wary of it due to the low price, but we have had no issues.",5
4139,"I really liked thePhilips AVENT Digital Video Baby Monitor, but found it lacked some features available on this Lorex model. However, while this monitor had some nice features, I found the reliability and durablity of this monitor lacking. The signal would often drop, frequently enough that we decided to unplug it to stop the 'no signal' alarms during the night. I would then set it up and it would work fine for a few days before dropping the signal frequently.We stopped using this when the camera fell off the dresser, and broke at the thin neck between the camera and the pedestal that it rests on.I can't complain too much about this, as it was free through Amazon Vine, but I have to admit that it spent a lot of time unplugged and unused due to its quirks and annoyances.",2
4140,"I thought I'd use this but didn't. In the direction it doesn't show you where your babies legs/feet should go - my baby liked to keep his legs stiff and straight so he'd manage to get his legs through the bottom of the carrier which wasn't right. I ended up buying a baby bjorn carrier because the infant head support is built right in so you don't need an extra insert like this and it works GREAT.",1
4141,"I got this blanket for my 14 month old son and he loves it. I got it for his crib to switch out his heavier winter blanket and this is great. It is so soft and the perfect size for him. After washing it a few times it has gotten softer and softer. Not too thin, but not too thick..Perfect summer blanket.",5
4142,"my 2 year old loves this blanket its soft but not thick he usually doesn't like any blankets as he sleeps but he will cuddle up to this one he drags it around the house all day. I wound up having to purchase 2 so he had one for day and a clean one at night while other one washes. The shape has stayed the same over many washes and it is still just as soft will be buying more for baby shower gifts.",5
4143,"I have 3 kids, my other 2 never seemed to mind cold wipes but my new baby cried every time I wiped her, got this - she loves the warm wipes. Does a good job, keeps wipes at a good temp. But make sure not to get thin wipes, they don't do well, rip as they come out. Works better with thick wipes. Only one warning, the warmth makes baby pee sometimes so have that new diaper ready :)",5
4144,"We love the wipe warmer!  I first thought it was a &#34;nice to have&#34; item for the nursery, but using cold wipes at 3 AM tended to wake up our baby which made it more challenging to get him to go back to sleep.  The warmer has been a wonderful addition.  In fact, one of my close girlfriends (whose son is 1 day younger than mine) didn't get the warmer, and when she came to visit for the day used mine.  She immediately bought the warmer (and the Huggies Natural Care wipes) for her son.  While it's not a critical item for the baby room, it's definitely been a great addition in our house!",5
4145,"Easy to inflate - baby loves the bath. Fits perfectly in my mother's tub and would travel well so you don't have to worry about accessability while you're away from home.",5
4146,"We previously purchased another set that lasted a fairly long time. This new set seems to be falling apart with just a few uses. Specifically the lids are cracking in the crease of the lid lip and this causes them to leak when laid down by my 1 yr old. We've had to throw away so many lids that it's just not worth keeping them around.",3
4147,"We are SOOOOO excited by this product.  Our son is 10 months old and rolling over constantly.  We could not change his diaper without big messes and chasing him all over the house.  Enter Happy Changer and now happy parents.  Our son is able to play with something while we change him but he cannot roll over while in this.  So glad we found this.  Do check the prices as some patterns cost less than others!",5
4148,"On one hand this was my sons favorite toy for so long. He loved it so much we bought two! I would keep getting them (as I'm sure he'd still like them) but they are not fully water tight.

4150,"I'm an experienced bib user, having been through three messy kids. I have used both the Baby Bjorn and these and they are both suited for different stages.Our Baby Bjorn is very easy to remove, so I did not like using it under about 2.5 years old. It is firmer and less floppy than the Tommee Tippee and I do like that about it. Once my children reached the age of understanding that if they remove the bib, their food is taken away, then the Bjorn was appropriate.However, the Tommee Tippee is harder to remove, so for the kid that is wanting to take the bib off, the TT works better. I often read people complain that this bib is not tight enough around the neck and gives room for food to dribble down. I agree with this, I have petite children and everything runs big on them. However, it is easily resolved by taking a standard hole punch and punching your own hole wherever you want it and this makes it tighter. The other advantage is that this makes a slightly smaller hole than what the bib comes with, and makes it even more difficult for the child to remove.I used our first set of bibs for over three years before they got moldy. One I had left accidentally in our travel booster dining seat for several weeks and I could not remove the mold from it. The other one finally starting cracking along the bottom. They were well worth the money and we got our use out of them.",5
4151,"Perfect bouncer for my LO, he loves it! and is so light and easy to clean that worth ever dollar. I know can be a little expensive but believe this one really worth it!",5
4152,"Easy to use, wash, carry/transport. Keeps baby entertained with the natural bounce. It's comfortable, doesn't hurt the thigh area like other bouncers.",4
4153,"May end up returning. Battery only lasted about 20 minutes the first time we unplugged it after being plugged in about 36 hours. The sound and picture are kinda weird too. We also don't like that it shuts off the video after 4 minutes when run on battery. It still has sound, but you have to push a button to get the video back for another 4 minutes. We bought this because we needed a second monitor for the new baby and liked the idea of the pan/tilt from the parent control. The pan/tilt is great. We really like that. I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this. If we return it, we will get a second Infant Optics and just have to have 2 hand consoles to watch each kid in their rooms so that we can have constant coverage of both rooms.",2
4154,"I was excited when I ordered this monitor and was very disappointed when it arrived. First I tried screwing the back on to the monitor but it would not stay on. I let it charge for about 12 hours hours before trying to use it at night but it died about 10 minutes after being turned on. Also the sound is really bad. I could barely hear my son fussing. I would not suggest anyone buy this video monitor",1
4155,"Not super impressed with this monitor. The picture isn't very clear, but it does the job. Would have probably spent a few more bucks and gotten the nicer one.",3
4156,"Very good cost x benefit. It delivers what it promises with a low cost. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",5
4157,"i have had these for over six months now and at first i really liked them. or at least i told myself that...now, i am not so sure. the problems i encountered may be typical of any reusable pouch. i think it would be hard to get one that is &#34;perfect&#34; without being prohibitively expensive.i purchased these to use on the go with my baby, a 3 year old and a 5 year old. they all love pouches but those things are expensive, go straight in the landfill, and are usually glorified applesauce or sugared up low-fat yogurt which is not my ideal snack. i wanted to give them something with protein and healthy fat to keep them full and not just give them a sugar buzz.these are attractive and study and seal well. very, VERY well. i read reviews about them being hard to open, and the manufacturer's tips for opening them correctly by applying pressure in a certain way before pulling the zipper part apart. when they are clean and empty, they are kinda hard to open but not too bad- and i have very small fingers with fingernails so i think anyone with larger hands would end up cursing these things. because it is a double track seal, you have to be able to get your fingers in to the seal and press down while you are pulling out, i know that makes no sense but bear with me. it is not rocket science but it is awkward. the real problem is, the other half of the time when you need to open them is to clean them out. and at that point they may have a little food smudged on them or condensation from being in a lunch box or whatever, point is they will have some residual moisture inside the seal and on the outside and it is dang near impossible to open it up with any ease. you can do it, but be prepared for it to take you a couple minutes. frustrating. then you have to try and get it clean, with a pretty small opening, which is hard to do and will take more time than you like. so even a self proclaimed slob such as myself feels a little grossed about reusing them. since they don't open wide, it is also hard to air them out. i put them in the dishwasher just to make sure, but am i really sure they are clean? not really. i am not a germophobe and i always do the sniff test to check that they don't have any lingering smells, but it is still a pain altogether.okay and filling them up? somedays it seemed to be easier than others. i almost always fill them with full fat greek yogurt (rather thick) and frozen wild (small) blueberries with a drizzle of honey. i had to get the hang of not overfilling, which is hard because you want to make the most of it, especially if it is feeding a toddler. no matter how much i put in though, it was hard not to have it squish out some when i was sealing it. not a huge deal, i would just lick it off and wipe it clean, but kind of annoying. i may be a slob but i don't enjoying licking up messes. usually. i usually just filled them up with a spoon because i couldn't figure out any better way. so you better zen out and focus or that spoon will smear your food all over the teeny opening. it is just barely big enough to be functional but by no means generously sized. sealing it is easy, it always seemed to seal the first time, no guesswork there at least.to top it off, i don't think they hold enough. it would be okay for a baby, but any child over 18 months old will suck this thing dry in a fraction of the time that you spend filling and cleaning it. to me that is frustrating.so as you have probably gathered- these things are almost more trouble than they are worth. it takes too much effort to use them so now after six months, they sit rarely used in my kitchen cabinet. at first i was so happy to save $$, make less waste, and control the ingredients in my kids snacks. i have learned a lesson, that if something isn't getting used, it is not saving me $$. i think i will try my luck with the silicone push-up style snack holders that you can use for frozen yogurt and smoothies. they hold more and seem to be easier to clean and fill up. although that will not work with my 15 month old, yet, in a short time he will be able to handle that and i can say bye-bye to pouches.i would recommend these with strong reservations. for the price, they are durable and you won't have to worry about leaks. some of the problems i have noted may be relevant to any reusable pouch- hard to clean, hard to fill, takes more effort than you'd like. but if you are really gung-ho and use a lot of pouches for your baby, and don't mind spending 3-4 minutes on either end of filling and cleaning, then go for it.i know sometimes you just need to give something to baby on the go that keeps them occupied and is better than cheerios! and spending 10 minutes making it is worth it because a younger baby might stay occupied with this for that long or more. good luck, folks :)",3
4158,"I really wanted to love these pouches, but they are too hard to use and keep clean. We gave up.",1
4159,"I got this stroller because I wanted a double.  I really wanted one with the metal wheels but this one has done well for me.  It is a little heavy and bulky and believe it or not, doesn't fit well into the back of my Ford Escape.  Both of my kids fit comfortably in this, with one being 22 months and one being 4.5 months.  Doesn't travel well off road though.  So if you like to go rugged, I wouldn't get this stroller.  I would recommend this to other moms doing paved trail, grocery shopping, etc.",4
4160,"Simple, effective plug covers in bulk. There's not much more to say about this, other than &#34;Why buy anything more complicated?&#34;",5
4161,"We love this pail liner! The elastic works great to hold the liner in place. It is the perfect size to hold the amount of diapers that we need to wash at a time while also not forcing us to wash everyday. We have two of these liners and we wash with each load of diapers we do and they have held up with no problem. In our system you don't really get to see the cute print but who cannot adore these cute little critters!",5
4162,"My son slept in this for the first 6 weeks of his life, and it was perfect for rocking him with my foot from the edge of my bed.  It was a total lifesaver and helped make an easy transition from here to his own bed.",5
4163,"don&#8217;t expect dainty eaters... this is for learning to use utensils. Got when the twins wouldn&#8217;t let me feed them anymore to help fill in the gaps that finger foods can&#8217;t fill (mostly yogurt). Catches enough that my babies continue to be interested for quite some time before they just start grabbing the semi-liquid food with their hands, but I will admit that at about 11 months old&#8212;with two babies&#8212; the mess was a bit more than I wanted to handle, so I put the spoons away for a month. Now at just over a year (one month later) I&#8217;ve pulled them back out and their coordination is better. Still on the face, but the high chair and clothes were much better. SO DON&#8217;T GIVE UP if it&#8217;s a little crazy. Just try again a while later.",5
4164,"I love these spoons.  After trying several others, I found these online.  I like that the scoop is a soft, rubberized material. This way, if baby clamps down I don't worry about his teeth.  Also, the mostly flat design works great for getting everything off the spoon.  Other dished out spoons were hard for him to clean off but with this style he can easily get the food off with just his lips. Lastly, the flattened tip is great for wiping excess off his face. ;)",5
4165,"I love these! They actually dont leak!!!  They have something in the straw that make it not leak. If fits up to 8 oz max. Love them and worth the money!!",5
4166,"This is a great idea and we use it at restaurants but we have to hold it down while we eat because my 1 year old is able to take it off the table.  The suction on this does not work well.  It works for a few seconds and then it comes loose on its own.",3
4167,"These are great! My son is really thin and all the pants fall down his legs.  These snaps have been great at getting the pants to hold and they are little and only go at the back so you barely notice them, if at all!",5

4169,"I have 2 different pacifier holders and this one is my least favorite. because the pacifier is held so close to the animal the animal actually pulls the pacifier out of baby's mouth. I have another one where the pacifier is held on the end of a long arm of the animal and it works much better.",3
4170,"This is an adorable paci animal, but it does not attach to the pacifiers given out at hospitals (soothie), there is a circular ring that stretches over the &#34;front&#34; of the pacifier.",3
4171,"My son loves his Wubbanub puppy but until he was old enough to put the paci part back in his mouth the Soothie paci it comes with would always fall out. He also took NUK pacis so I searched for a puppy to use with that. He has zero interest in this guy. Who knows why but I had to give it that review because he won't take it.",1
4172,"Bought this for a vacation- my daughter loved it. It's light, collapsible, and novel enough for my daughter to not beg to sleep in the bed with us. She's a small 4 year old and still fits great in it. We have been taking it on all our overnight trips. No more preschooler hogging all the bed!",4
4173,"Very nice product. Comes with a free toy and extra cover. I really like that the cover is washable. the pillow fits nicely around my wife's waist.",5

4175,"Love anything nuk lol well except the pacifiers. It matches with my baby's nuk bottles. U scarcely find sippy cups with covers now.",5
4176,"These cups are great.  By far our absolute favorite.  We actually invested a small fortune in them and replaced all of our sippy cups with these and other models of these!Reasons why we love them:-they truly do not leak. Anyway you turn them they do no leak!- So easy to put together (my husbands favorite point) - not like other cups there is one piece and only way to put it and it snapsin...truly dummy proof- Not hard to clean (we always just throw ours in the dishwasher) - but you can use a brush to clean them easilyI was shocked when I got on here and saw they did not have a 5star rating!  Recommend these to ALL my friends when buying sippy cups and I often give them as baby gifts to get their collection started!  I have been using them for almost a year and seriously have not had one leak!!  Happy Drinking!!",5
4177,"When my daughter was first born, I soon learned that I didn't get enough milk for her. She has since been a formula baby. Finding the right combination of bottles and formula seemed to take forever! To this day (6 months later), the Nuk bottles are the only ones that don't leave her gassy and uncomfortable. I tried everything. Literally. Playtex, Dr. Brown's, Gerber... you name it, I tried it. This was the only one that worked. She has every pattern they have available I'm pretty sure. The nipple is the most natural shaped I've found. She is now holding the bottles herself and enjoying every feeding. And there are only 3 parts to clean. (well, 4 if you use the cover) The Munchkin bottle brushes are what I use and they are fabulous as well!",5
4178,"Wasnt the same design as the pic but am ecstatic still because its NUK after all. Bought these for my newborn baby. No problem.",5
4179,"I buy these because they do not leak. I have a crazy busy destructive toddler and these cups hold up! Cups that leak go in the trash. These are great!",5
4180,"i have come to the conclusion that Nuk just makes an excellent product.  i love their binkies, and these sippy cups are great.  they are easy to clean, don't leak at all, and are the perfect size for a toddler/pre-schooler.",5
4181,"Best low-cost sippies. We use these for daycare since they tend to get lost in the shuffle and it doesn't hurt so much to replace them.  Best of all, they don't leak and they are easy to clean. My favorite low-cost cups. A little hard to drink from though because of the valve for my toddler, but I can't complain for the price.",4
4182,"You can shake these upside down! No leaks. Perfect.They are really nice to drink out of (Yes, I tried it), and they are a great price :)",5
4183,"I dind't like the shape of these. Our lo dind't either. I tried many sippy cups and out favorites were the Playtex with the straws, using the munchkin replaceable straws in order o hit the bottom of the cup (just shave off the end with a knife). The hard nozzle gets worn away from biting more than the rubber ones. Gerber Graduates were great too.  We used those for mil since they were spill/drip proof and we used the Playtex straw ones for water since they do leak a little. They are not hard to put together like some reviewers say.",2
4184,"I have 2 1/2 YO twins and an older child so I have been through my share of sippy cups. I have to say these are the best. They do not leak at all. My children do not have a hard time getting the liquid out.Only tip is to buy a nipple brush to clean the removable valve and the inside of the spout. If not cleaned properly milk will curdle in there. I had to enforce this to my Nanny and household several times as the twins health are at stake.Like other reviews my only gripe is the base is too large to fit in most cup holders (their stroller and my cup holders in my car). To combat this issue I attach these straps I bought a while back and attach them so the cups do not fall in commute.Other than that these are great!",5
4185,"I ended up returning it because it's too bulky for our space. It does not stay on the faucet snug enough either.",3

4187,"Deep dish and made in the USA. Love it. Beautiful pink color. I wish it can use in microwave",5
4188,"These are my favorite plates for everyday use for my 2 kids, ages 3 and 6. They are bright and fun, the right size for toddler to school age kid, and perfect for compartmentalizing food for your picky eater (&#34;mom don't let the green beans touch my chicken&#34;). They are easily cleaned as well and look as good as new after several months of use. However, I only put them on the top rack of the dishwasher and I've never used them in the microwave (I'm pretty sure they're not microwave-safe). I would buy more of these if they weren't so pricey!",5
4189,"This stroller is a smooth ride for your little one. I love that the front wheel swivels for everyday use. It's so easy to rock my son to sleep in this. It handles all terrain very effortlessly. It lives up to the Jeep name for sure!!! The features are awesome. Very adjustable seat. Totally worth buying. Glad that I found this.",5
4190,"This sleeper worked great when I first set it up. The baby stays in it for sometime but not for long. The problem I have with this sleeper is that I don't get it to close. In the video it looked so easy but it's not. No matter how many time I push the bottoms at the side it wont close. It's really annoying me. I think one of bottoms isn't working because it doesn't snap when I press it. You should really make sure all the parts on your products are working before you sell it to someone. I'm so fed up and annoyed I can break this sleeper.",1
4191,"I regret registering for this product. For the first 4 weeks my baby only wanted to be held, until he finally adjusted to sleeping in this. He's safe and comfortable, but now, at 5 1/2  months old, he's quickly outgrowing it and it's made transitioning to the crib a NIGHTMARE. He will not reliably sleep in his crib yet and still prefers the sleeper. But he's almost too long for it and can now roll over, so it's time to put this away for good. Wish I'd never heard about it and simply worked harder at getting him to sleep in the crib as a newborn. Buy at your own risk. Ugh.",3
4192,"My son slept in this for 4 months and it was a life saver! We loved the vibrating feature at first. When he was really young it helped put him to sleep. I remember reading other negative reviews and I have no complains. I wash the bedding every week or so and had no problems.",5
4193,"using this for our bassinet and it is so easy to fold and take anywhere. So happy we purchased this! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!! WELL WORTH IT!!!!!!!! I would recommend this product to everyone!",5
4194,"This was a surprise gift. I didn't ask for it or even know it existed. It has become the most used and indispensable baby item I have. It was the first thing I put my baby in when I got home from the hospital. She hated her crib and ended up sleeping in it next to me. She's 20 months old now and still insists on taking afternoon naps in it. The thing is super sturdy. She's been getting herself in and out of it since she was 12 months old. All that movement and no tipping. (She's 26 lbs and 33 inches tall, beyond the 25 lb weight limit and the rocker is holding up like a champ) Sometimes She'll just crawl in it and go to sleep. Still has never slept a day in her crib. She sleeps all night in her big girl bed (Went straight to that with no issues at 18 months). Also it is very easy to fold and super light. It's great to bring along to visits with relatives when the baby is small. I can not comment on the vibration feature, they didn't have that when I got mine.",5
4195,"These are amazing. They weren't around for my older kids. Baby will settle happily in the RNP when nothing else will do. We are being careful to avoid flat head.",5
4196,"Technology seems to improved quite a bit with baby monitors in the 2 yrs.  both image quality (day and night vision) and the sound are better on the uniden than my older Samsung 3030 model.  Even if the resolution is about the same, the larger screen does make it easier to see my kid.  The downside of the uniden in my opinion are:  aspect distortion (like watching a 4:3 video stretched horizontally to fit a widescreen, which may actually be what it is doing) and the poorer build quality compared to my old Samsung monitor.  This one does not feel as solid in construction and one of the rarely used button of changing music melody caved inside/broke after a month.",4
4197,"I really like this little cup.  It has a nice grip for little one's to hold so the cup is less likely to slip out of their hands.  There is 1/2 cup liquid when filled to the bottom of the grip, so I am guessing it could hold maybe a 3/4 to 1 cup.  I never fill it past the grip just in case it spills.  It is also dishwasher safe which is a huge plus.",5
4198,"cute, easy for my toddler to drink from.  We use it in the bathroom!",5
4199,"I love everything we purchase from OXO and just like all the other items we have, these are made well, they are visually really cute and perfect for our 3 year old to use.  The toddler forks no longer worked for us as the prongs were too flat and wide for our daughter to spear food with, but an adult fork was too big for her - this set is the perfect in between and the little grip pads teach her how to properly hold and cut.",5
4200,"overall ok. especially for the priceit DOES fit 5oz, but you have to expand the bottom, which can be hard some times.also, filling/cleaning is a pain. cleaning the inside where the mouthpiece meets the bag is the hardest, but i found using a baby bottle cleaner helps.",3

I couldn't live without that one and still use it regularly but I am finding now that my son is 17 lbs (4-5 months old) that this one fits him better.  He is tall so his legs are getting cramped in the Rock N' Play now.  I would still buy it again in a heartbeat though.  This one is not as soft or quite as liked as the Rock n' Play, however, it allows his hips to rotate, which is good for his growth.In addition to this, I would also buy the Day Dreamer again.  It has an incline that is also great for babies that don't lay flat well or have acid reflux.",5
4203,"My baby with silent reflux sleeps in here. It's bigger than the rock and plays and costs half as much.",5
4204,"My husband and I found that the Teddy Bear Strap Covers were much better.  They are fuller and softer on the babies face.  These are very flat and not very soft and do nothing to support my son's head in the carrier.",2
4205,"I was so pleased with these Alvas.  They fit my daughter great!  She was a big girl at birth, and I waited until she was a month old before I started them....she was 10+ lbs and wears them on the smallest setting.  They are the best fitting brand of my stash....and the cheapest!  Love it!",5
4206,"They will do everything any other cloth diaper will. So far i can tell that all the diapers are made from same plu. The &#34;pocket&#34; doesn't do much for me, i just put the insert on top. My only problem is that my kids have really small butts. Even though the alva diapers adjust to fit snug, they look bulky. One more thing : i got 2 different types of inserts, wich i am actually glad for, i like ones more than the others.",4
4207,"I have not bought this exact set, but I have bought quite a few alva baby diapers. They are great in my opinion. Before I even started using cloth, I bought the same design diaper (a Spiderman looking design) from Alva Baby and several small diaper boutiques because I kept being told that alva baby diapers were inferior (mostly by the boutiques themselves or friends who discovered alva baby too late I think).  So the double price was supposed to be justified. After comparing the boutique diapers to the alvas, they all seemed to be virtually the same. My first son would throw a fit if I put him in cloth (started too late I think). I have recently tried to give it a go with my second son and the alvas seem just as high quality to me still. They are also super easy to use. I can't believe I did not cloth diaper sooner. I think I researched it too much and got scared. I seriously just stuff an insert in them, snap them on my son, and toss them in the wash (in their own load and with diaper safe detergent) when I am done. I usually dry them on a low temperature or hang them out to dry. I am honestly not sure what the instructions are for drying. I really wanted to do prefolds, but honestly, these are so cheap and easy to use, I am pretty sure I will just stick with them.  They are the best deal out there for cloth diapering. I have seriously spent under $50 on my cloth diapers.",5

4211,"I originally bought a silicone 'stylish' necklace for my daughter to use as a teether and distraction while nursing. It lasted about five minutes since all she was interested in doing was trying to yank the cord off of my neck. A friend of mine had this and my daughter loved playing with it while she held her. I ordered one for myself and I'm so happy that I did! I love ducks and to me it looks like it could be a rubber duck which is a huge plus. Though my daughter does pull on it, it doesn't feel like she is trying to decapitate me as was with the other one. She also likes to put it in my mouth and I don't have any complaints either.",5
4212,"My son loves chewing on this teething necklace. It works really well. I feel much better about him chewing on natural wood rather than so much plastic. It's really cute to wear too.",5
4213,"I put this on in the morning and basically forget that I'm wearing it.  Then I pick up my 9 month old baby and suddenly I feel a pull at my neck.  She's found my necklace.  But wait -- that's okay!  She actually likes the string attached to it just as much as she likes the pendant, the bird.  And I've had two people so far tell me they like the bird, asking for the &#34;story&#34; on it.  They were surprised when I said it was just a teether necklace!",5

This is a heavy item and my son has definitely bumped himself with it a few times while picking it up.  If you're concerned, just don't leave it within baby's reach.  My little guy has already figured out how to turn this on and will often play with this upon awaking in the morning.",4
4218,"David's wife here...This monitor/camera combo was a big disappointment to us.  I'll list the pros and cons.  Pros first. 1) the monitor shows the volume level on the side so you can have the monitor on mute and still tell if the baby is crying or not.  That is a great feature we rely on a lot  2) the monitor says the temp of the room the baby is in (where the camera is set up) which is nice because sometimes our daughter's room gets colder than the rest of the house. 3) the camera can move just by touching the monitor screen so if the baby scoots down in the crib you can change the angle of the camera to see her better.  Now Cons. 1) the touch screen is super sensitive.  If the monitor is on, there really isn't a place to hold it without moving the camera or hitting a button 2) there are a ton of buttons along the top and sides of the monitor so you have to be super careful when grabbing or moving it 3) it doesn't have a clock on it...why not?  You show the temp but not the time?  weird and annoying 4) the stand to set up the monitor is slippery so it falls really easily and it's loud when it falls down, happens all the time, especially when trying to not touch the wrong button or not move the camera angle accidentally. 5) the video doesn't always turn on.  Sometimes I hit the on button and it just doesn't come on.  No idea why.  I have to try 2 or 3 times sometimes.  And every once in a while, it's glitchy and distorted so I have to turn it off and on again.  6) sometimes, when the video does come on, it stays on.  Other times it turns off after about 20 seconds.  Not sure why/how it does that. 7) It runs out of power pretty quickly if not plugged in, although it does come with about 10 feet of cord so you can probably reach an outlet no matter where you are.  All in all - we wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to anyone.  Especially for the cost!",2

It smells awful, and the paint job appears to be done with a paint that I would compare to white-out.  It is lumpy and chipping off in places.  The picture makes this toy appear quite pretty, but in person, the face looks very poorly done, and the squeak is so so loud (just like a dog chew toy).  My suggestion is to spend the extra money and get the real thing.",1
4222,"Not only is Lela super cute, but my daughter loves to chew on her. The fact that she squeaks makes it even better because it's a great toy as well.",5
4223,"These do the job, but are slightly lower grade plastic than the name brand. They don't get a good fit across all Medela parts and the membranes seem to fail more quickly.",3
4224,"I don't know why but when I use these breastshields with my pump I do not get as much milk as when I use the Medela brand small breastshields. Maybe it is the different membranes (they are slightly different) or the fact that the pump tubing connects into the top of the device circle instead of the bottom??? Even though the name brand is more expensive I would spend the extra few dollars to get them.",2
4225,"I ordered the 21 mm and they sent the 19 mm. All they had to do was match my order with the number on the product.",1
4226,"Pros:  Easy to clean (dishwasher), Well-constructed, came with extra valve membranes.Cons:  The flange and stem do not come apart like some other products, so you won't be able to swap this one out with certain pumps (such as manual pumps, for example).Other thoughts:  We looked all over town for the 27mm Breastshield flange.  (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Target).  The ONLY store that had them in stock was Target (but someone had returned them with a 24mm in the box!).  Of the stores that had ANY in stock, they only had ONE unit of ONE size, usually.  Online is practically the only place to find accessories like this.",5
4227,"Works exactly as it should. I like this 1 piece version better than the 2 piece versions because the 2 piece seems to wear near the bottom of the flanges to where they fall off while mid-pump! I've since dumped all my 2 piece Medela kits and replaced them with these 1 piece Maymoms..Only 4 starts because though they are built well and I use mine 3-5x a day for 4 mos or so now, I just got a little chip in one of the yellow attachment parts.. but because I bought 2 sets I'm just replacing it with another spare, even though it is still functional. Just afraid it may chip more and drop into the breast milk without me noticing.. think it was a defective part and that this product is still great and at a great value.",4
4228,"Had all the parts I needed to use my Medela breast pump. Everything fit perfectly and was easy to clean. Great product.",5
4229,"You get more for your money and these are easier to clean than the originals.  I find them to be just as good if not better than the originals.  Less parts to clean or lose.",5
4230,"I cleaned these cup in hot water with my bottle brush and after examining the cup the hot water melted the cups. Ended up trashin them and purchasing medela. MEDELA is the way to go for breast cups. The medela bottle should be left on the shelf. They don't hold up.",1
4231,"These are our baby girls absolute favorite blankets.  They are wonderfully soft and light so she doesn't get too hot.  She has trouble sleeping, and likes to grabs handfuls of the fabric and covers her face. These were a gift, and were absolutely beautiful, but they only get a 4 out of 5 because I think they are overpriced.I washed and dried these on delicate cycles and low heat without a problem.",4
4232,"I love avent products!!!! This satisfied my expectations. No leaks! It reduces or prevents gas colic as well. Happy baby indeed!",5
4233,"I like that these bottles don't have any extra insert parts.  They were very easy to clean and put together.  But the nipple kept collapsing on my son from day one.  It happened nurmerous times per feeding.  I struggled with the frustration until my son was eating more than 4 ounces and happily switched to another brand.  I will not use these bottles for my next child.",2

4235,"We have been using the Munchkin Lullavibe for a while, and our 5 month old loves it.  I decided to go for this one despite the higher price, because of the cry-activated feature.  First, out of the box - there was a very strong chemical smell.  I put it outside over night and it still smelled the next day.  I had it in the garage for an entire week (without the car, obviously) and it still smelled.  I was concerned about what chemical was applied to this item, so I emailed CoCaLo.  No response.  Finally I called, and someone just quickly responded that it wasn't treated with anything -- she said &#34;we don't treat any of our items with fire retardants&#34; (which is the only chemical I could think that would make that intense of a smell).  I wasn't all that convinced, and frankly, I was mad that I couldn't get anything in writing that they do not add flame retardants.  Off gassing plus babies aren't the greatest combo.Anyway!  It's not the right product for us.  I thought it worked well otherwise -- cry feature worked great.  It seems to have a less powerful vibration than the Lullavibe.  It takes 4 batteries, and Lullavibe takes 3.  The Lullavibe requires a screwdriver to change the batteries, the CoCaLo does not.",3
4236,"I bought this when my twins turned 5 month old (8 month now) and they've been using it since. It has great back support and you can take it anywhere you go.  The belt is adjustable and have plenty of room for their legs.  Would def recommend.",4
4237,"I bought this over the other floor seats because my little guy is a chunkster, 18 lbs at 4 months old. He didn't like sitting in it until 5 months though. The safety belt is useless. I never leave him alone in the seat anyway.It is a nice way for him to practice sitting up with some support that isn't mommy! He's not the biggest fan, but we'll see if he grows more into it.",5
4238,"I purchased these stroller hook clips to replace ones that came with my stroller bag that ripped after 2 months of use. These seem much more sturdy, can be used on any stroller and are easy to add on. My favorite part of them is that they can stay on after you fold the stroller. The one I had before was just looped around it and had to be removed every time I put the stroller in the car. Received them in 2 days (prime membership). Highly recommend!",5
4239,"These hooks are amazing! Nothing these hooks can't hold! I have a very heavy diaper bag and these hooks have no problem supporting it. Definitely buy more if needed!!",5
4240,"The real bummer on these is that only the roundish ones are actually links.  The rest don't have the space in them where you could attach them independently.  I love these and so does my daughter but we use this with a pack of regular links to have enough links to get everything the way we like it.In the picture shown (12 linky loops) there are only 4 actual chain-style links.  The other 8 are circles you can connect to a link but not each other.All of that said my little one loves the colors and grabbing at them.",4
4241,"I was so particular that we bought the originals that cost upwards of fifty dollars but so happy we gave this a try.Wife says these are are not any different and i like the fact that the one piece design is actually easier to clean in the sterilizer.",5
4242,"My only negative is that unlike the Medela brand the breast shield does not detach. Otherwise, its a great buy!",4
4243,"works great with my medela pump in style advanced for a fraction of the cost. i like that the phlange is connected to the valve rather than separate like with the medela style. this is my set for work, which i use 3x a day 5x a week. Fantastic.",5
4244,"Good quality and great price. Much cheaper than the Medela brand and worked perfectly with my other medela pump and parts. The only difference is the screw part is a little smaller so the bottle is pretty snug when you screw it in. I didn't mind this because there are some Ameda bottles I have that would fall off the medela Shields if I bumped them. These fit those slightly smaller bottle just fine without fear of them falling off.",5
4245,"I bought the actual pump used and even though the person said they had never used it I still wanted my own new supplies.  These worked great!",5
4246,"This is the best design out there. The mesh ones get so gross and are very hard to completely clean all the food particles out of. This is very clean and sanitary.",5
4247,"This works great. We use it for frozen fruit. My daughter can hold on to it well and it holds a lot. The only issue I have is that the hole at the end had started to expand and larger chunks of fruit come through which can be a choking hazard for you ger babies.",4
4248,"At first I was skeptical as my new born was not a spitter at all and she never used them, however since she turned 3 months old we used all the burp cloths we bought. These are easy to use, easy to wash and keep their shape. And the colors are really cute too.",5
4249,"This is our second purchase of the same chair, for our second daughter.  We now have two and we use the tray with our 1 year old, but our 3 year old just sits in it and eats from her plate at the table.  This chair is versatile and functional - we couldn't wait until our youngest was done with her high chair and ready to sit at the table!",5
4250,"This is a great solution to protecting your nice stroller when you check it in gate-side.  I'm very happy with the purchase, except that the interior material somehow got rubbed on something and ripped - it's as if a piece was hanging out of one of the corners.  It's not a big deal.  My feedback to the manufacturer would be to make the pull handle while dragging it a bit more sturdy (it feels like it will tear, but hasn't yet).  Also, the shoulder strap - it's confusing on which loops it needs to go over.",4
4251,"My subject line says it all.  They are cheap and BPA-free, and surprisingly sturdy.  I wash and re-use them, but I'm not devastated if I leave one somewhere.  They're also great for vacations.  We uy them before we go, and then just don't bother bringing them home.Also, the lids snap on nice and tight, so even when dropped they (most of the time) don't pop off.",5
4252,"These are great cups. I ordered them for a 2 year old birthday party we were hosting, forgot to use them and decided to keep them for use at home. They really are spill proof. I've put them in the dishwasher to clean (top rack) and they come out just fine.",5
4253,"These work great in my diaper genie 2 elite and the price is better than the brand name ones as I have 2 in diapers anything that saves $$ is great.",5
4254,"I like these diaper genie refills. They work just as well as the brand name refills and are a bit cheaper. Bags feel hefty and seem to keep odors contained. Good buy.",5
4255,"These fit my diaper genie perfectly and I have not noticed any compromise in effectiveness or amount of diapers it can hold.",5
4256,"Pros: CheapCons: Thin plastic that does not keep the smell containedBottom Line: Not worth the couple of bucks you save by buying these sub-par quality refills.",1
4257,"Fits in the diaper genie with no problems. My only dislike is the opening is a little smaller than the oem refill. Other than that rock solid product.",5
4258,"These are cheaper than the playtex refills but they do not block the odor as well. I have to change them out much sooner than expected. I will not be purchasing again.",3
4259,"This is a good value, but the &#34;features&#34; are lacking in two minor areas.1. No &#34;warning stripe&#34; as you near the end of the cartridge. The brand name ones have this warning stripe.2. The opening is just a touch smaller than the brand name cartridges, but this is very, very minor and in no way makes them less usable.The plastic has yet to rip for us, and we really pack these things FULL. We even hold the lid open and push the diapers down to compact them sometimes when we just don't feel like changing the bag yet, haha! Gross, I know, but come on...parents, we've all been in much nastier situations!",4
4260,"Sleeping with a baby in bed is extremely dangerous, this product allows for baby (ours fit for maybe first 2-3 months) to sleep in bed with mom and dad.",5
4261,"the measurements are ALWAYS way off. every time i pump i have to pour the milk from the bag into a measuring cup and it ALWAYS shows a volume much less than the bag measured. pouring back and forth like that defeats the purpose of this system. i always fully expand the bottom and everything but, without fail, if it looks like i have 3oz as shown on the bag i pour it into the measuring cup and it's 2oz or 2.5oz. that's a huge difference when working with so little milk.",3
4262,"The bag is off by as much as 1oz. I need to store my milk and I need accurate measurement so I pump into my medela bottle and then pour it in the pouch. I also have to indicate in the pouch how many ozs in the pouch. It takes 2 extra minutes, however, I must say It stores really well in the freezer and the twist cap is a major plus. No worries about spills and these bags are also cheaper but very good alternative to the pricey medela storage bottles. When you have to store a lot  medela bottle adds up. This is the best storage bag in the market in my opinion albeit the measurement issue. So if you don't mind the extra step and need a secure storage bag then this is a great product.",3
4263,"I love this line of products. I wish it had been available when my first son was born. It works exactly as described with no issues. We received it quickly and it is such a relief to be able to pop a bag of milk into this bottle and not have to deal with scrubbing bottles when were done. I'll never use regular bottles again.",5
4264,"I use medela pump in style and the standard adapter fits and you can pump directly into the kiind bag",5
4265,"PROs:I LOVE this system! Easy to use, freeze, store, label, and warm up (even without the expensive Kiinde warmer). The starter kit comes with everything you need and is a great way to try the system out.Other reviews mark the cost as a con, but I think it is worth every penny.The adapter for my Medela Freestyle pump works really well without leaking, the bags don't leak when frozen or thawing, and they store quite nicely in the freezer.My daughter nurses from the breast most of the time now (I am pumping mainly to prepare for when I return for work), and she has no problems with nipple confusion. I will say that the slow flow nipple was a bit too slow for her (she would just stop trying to eat after trying really hard to get milk out), but the medium flow has been working just fine for her.Of course, clean up is a breeze since all you have to do is clean the nipple (with the included nipple brush).This is also great for traveling because instead of a bunch of bulky bottles, all you need is the bottle &#34;frame,&#34; the nipple, and a few bags, which pack really compactly, are light, and you come back with less than you packed instead of a bunch of empty bottles.I honestly think the thing I like most about this system is the ease of warming up the bags. Note: I do not use the Kiinde warmer - I use either body heat if traveling (see below) or warm tap water. Sometimes when we take longer day trips I like to bring a bottle just in case we end up someplace where I can't nurse. These bags are great because you can easily warm them up with just your body heat, and you can do it relatively quickly. I find that when I use a traditional bottle it takes much longer to warm them up, and I can't do it with just my body heat because the milk is much more condensed in a smaller area, if that makes sense. With the bags I can kind of &#34;spread out&#34; the distribution of the milk so that there is more milk that is in contact with the heat source, and thus I only have to mix it around once or twice to distribute the warmed milk throughout. I don't know if that makes sense, but imagine putting a bottle between your hands to warm up versus a bag which you can squeeze flat.Our friend actually has the warmer and uses it with tommee tippee bottles and it seemed to warm the bottle up incredibly quickly - in a matter of seconds. We are just cheap so we take the extra time to warm them up with tap water - baby doesn't mind!CONs:I don't actually use the storage tray they give you because I found that it takes up too much room. I just use cereal or granola bar boxes stacked in the freezer which I think works equally well. Not really a con, though, as much as a preference.The only real con I have is this, and again it's not much of a con because it is pretty inevitable with any pumping/storing system, but something to keep in mind especially if you are a first time mom and don't have any experience with this:The main reason I bought this system was to limit extra air that got in the milk from transferring milk from bag to bottle (and thus reduce baby's gas), and also limiting the loss of milk in the transfer. This, however, is somewhat inevitable because you don't pump the same amount every time, and you can't always perfectly anticipate how much your baby wants to eat. So you at times may need to combine bags to give your baby enough milk to eat. You could always avoid this problem by just feeding from multiple bags during one feeding, but I was a bit OCD and didn't want to heat up milk and then have leftovers since I didn't like heating up the same bag twice.I recommend this to all of my expecting and new-mom friends. I always hesitate before buying bottles or any sort of feeding product for others since each baby and each parent has different preferences, but I think this makes a great baby shower gift because it really isn't that expensive to get for someone else, if they like it they can save the expense of trying it out (before I got this as a gift I hesitated to buy it for myself since we were spending so much money on everything else) and if they don't want to use it anymore they don't have to! No harm, no foul.",5
4266,"So I was pretty excited to get this until I saw that it only heats water. Previous reviewer is right, it's a kettle. I was hoping that you could mix the formula in there. I'm a huge fan of tommee tippee products but this one is a let down. While people may think 2 min is great but I just zap our in the microwave for 20 seconds and it's ready.",3
4267,"Fits my medela pump in style and it also fit the ameda pump I used at hospital. Allows me to pump directly in bottle. I can even use a medela or ameda bottle cap to close the top. A must have for tommee tippee breastmilk moms!",4
4268,"LIFESAVER in pumping directly from the standard mouth Medela pump into a Tommee Tippee bottle. I used to stupidly pump into the medela bottle, then put that in the fridge, then transfer it into the tommee bottles when time came to feed. I'd have to swirl the milk around before transferring to loosen the fatty parts of the milk, which could accidentally destroy the good stuff in breast milk. This cuts down multiple steps.",5
4269,"These are awesome and they save me the hassle of switching from &#34;pumping&#34; bottles to my trusted Tommee Tippee bottles.",5
4270,"This helps me use my Tommee Tippee bottles with my Spectra breast pump breast shields.  It is really handy and made of high quality material.",5
4271,"This thing is just what I needed to get my teething 1 year old to stop gnawing on her crib rail.  It's also nice and soft in case she bonks her head on it when standing in her crib.  I originally didn't want to get a fabric one, but I'm glad I did.",5
4272,"This stroller hook easily attached to the handlebar of my Bob Revolution Duallie double stroller and I have found so many great uses for it.  I have hung my hat, purse, waterbottle, grocery bags (between two hooks) and I am so glad that I found this product.  I highly recommend it as it is a great value.  Of course be careful about hanging things from a handlebar as the stroller can tip as your children exit the stroller, so use it smartly!",5
4273,"I received this product in exchange for my review, so here we go...Do NOT let your baby play with these hooks, the stroller was in the truck when I received the hooks so when we were planning to go out on our first outing with the hooks I let the baby (15 months) hold them. Thank goodness I was sitting in the back seat with her because all of a sudden I noted something in her mouth, one of the little stick on logo disc was in her mouth and could have been a choking hazard. I recommend from package to stroller and no little hands in between.I'm only giving this a four out of five stars ONLY because of the logo disc coming off (partly my fault for letting her hold them) and I haven't had them very long so I don't know how durable they are long-term. But other than that they would have received five stars.These are great hooks, they fit any stroller (or item with a handle) and are easily installed thanks to the Velcro design. I love the fact that the hooks swivel, this allows me to hang my purse and/or shopping bags and then turn the hook opening to the inside to help prevent easy removal by anyone just walking by. They are rated to hold 6lbs each, I haven't weighed my bags, but after a while, they sure seem to weigh more than that.The swivel hook design makes it very easy for me to remove bags when needed. I've also used the carbiner clip and it is next to impossible to get my bags off it, but these open hooks make life so much easier.Thanks for sending such a great product...I would recommend these to anyone!",4
4274,"These hooks are LIFESAVERS. They are very easy to attach to ANY stroller and even leave there when you fold the stroller up. I am able to put my purse, diaper bag, groceries and anything else. I also love that it comes with two so it balances out the weight if the child is not in the stroller. I recommend these for every mom. Especially those on the go!!",5
4275,"This crib liner is pretty good. I deducted a star because the ties used to tie the liner to the crib slats are not very long and I can't get them really tight. They slip down a bit and so the top of the crib slats are exposed.  I have to keep pulling them up or retightening. Not too big a deal, still prevents my baby from getting her arms and legs stuck in between the slats.  Easy to install with Velcro.",4
4276,"Easy to put on, but a little weak in the &#34;pretty&#34; department.  I personally don't give a hoot either way, but my wife says it isn't pretty, and wants one of those frilly fluffy ones.  It does it's job, but when the baby rolls into it, there is no give for face planting into the bars, so do your baby a favor, do your wife a favor, and do yourself a favor and just spend the money on something frilly and fluffy and do the while baby year thing.",3
4277,"This is a great product and I would buy it again. I just wish it where there are ties at the top of the liner, that there would be ties along the bottom too. I think that it would help keep the liner in place better.",4
4278,"A bouncer is definitely an essential piece of equipment for any little one - and an even more essential piece of equipment for the adults caring for the baby.  Like all Fisher-Price products, the ""Fisher-Price My Little Snugapuppy Deluxe Bouncer"" is an excellent quality item.The plastic edges are smoothly finished; they should not injure your infant.  The fabric component of the seat has seams and edges that cleanly finished. The soft fabric is not cheap or scratchy. If necessary and it will be, the cover removes easily for washing.  The extra padding makes this bouncer appear as if it would be more comfortable for your little one.The subdued colors of the cloth seating area are attractive and more subtle than fabric used on other iterations of the Fisher-Price bouncer.  For grandparents who want to have some infant equipment in their home, but who have moved beyond vividly colored children's equipment, the ""Fisher-Price My Little Snugapuppy Deluxe Bouncer"" is an attractive option.  The one drawback to the subdued color scheme is that it carries through to the ""mobile"" that is not sufficiently eye-catching to interest an infant.The inclined seat is very useful if your little one suffers from reflux since keeping the baby upright, after feeding, for the 15 - 30 minutes your doctor may recommend can be tiring if the baby is large or it is o-dark-thirty at night.  Further, the incline is also nice because once your baby is a bit older and staying awake more, you can move the seat between rooms as you go about your daily life. This allows the baby to observe different environments and allows you to explain your activities so that the baby's language learning can advance.We found the vibrating feature helpful when the baby was fussy or when she was having difficulty going to sleep. It was soothing and helped calm her down. When she was awake, the ability to ""bounce"" provided exercise and entertainment; it also helped strengthen muscles that were not yet ready for crawlingAlthough rated for up to 25 lbs., the ""Fisher-Price My Little Snugapuppy Deluxe Bouncer"" is useful up to about 20 pounds. At that point, the baby's weight is sufficient to prevent the upright position from being particularly useful.  As a grandparent, I found the ""Fisher-Price My Little Snugapuppy Deluxe Bouncer"" essential - it fills a number of useful functions, is well made, and my little one loves it.",5
4279,"Babies love these seats so much that they tend to catnap in them. Unfortunately this particular seat times out after 30 or 45 minutes and the vibrating stops, abruptly waking up a sleeping baby. If the vibration didn't time out this would be a perfect seat. The mobile is interesting without being overwhelming. It is easy to take off and put back on as well. The seat is quite upright, even with a 14lb baby in it, so they can look around and check out the scene in the room. The material is so soft and comforting! Easy to clean, the cover comes right off and washes well. The seat bounces when they kick, or you can bounce it with your foot or hand. Overall a great seat, if the vibration wouldn't turn off on its own.",3
4280,"This chair is cute and easy to wash, but it just doesn't work as it should.  When our baby was a newborn, the chair was too sunken so we had to put a towel behind the dog cushion to keep our baby propped up.  At about two months old, our baby loved kicking and this chair actually became a hazard because there's not enough cushioning at the bottom.  Our baby was kicking her legs and started crying - I looked and she had actually cut herself on the plastic button control box.  So now we have to roll a towel / blanket and put it under the bottom of the dog cushion so she doesn't hurt her delicate little feet.  I wanted to love this chair, but it just isn't a good product.",2
4281,"Every new mom needs a bouncy seat. After those first few blurry eyed weeks, you'll appreciate this product's ability to be moved easily from room to room.  This is one of the best designs I've seen. The colors are beautiful and the fabric is super soft on your baby's skin.  It is rated to 25 pounds although it's bounciness was significantly reduced on my 20 lb 9 month old.  At this point though, it isn't as necessary as it is in those early days. I love this product! It's the perfect fit for your little one!",5
4282,"Got this bouncer for my friend's baby and we really like it! The puppy design is adorable and suitable for either gender and the entire seat is super soft and cushiony. I liked that the puppy cover comes off easily and is machine washable for the inevitable moments of spit ups! We've washed it several times already and it hasn't lost its plushness or faded at all. It comes with a plush overhead mobile of a dog and cat, which is removable and helps with visual/focusing skills. The entire seat is very lightweight and easy to transport from room to room when you need to.The seat is wonderful to keep the baby occupied with the mobile or to keep him/her calm when you are trying to get some chores done and the 3 point restraint system keeps the baby securely in the seat. My friend's baby has colic and the built in vibrations do wonders to calm him down when it seems nothing else will. It also helps lull him to sleep. You can also lightly bounce the baby seat to calm a fussy baby. The music is soft and plays for about 20 minutes.The only thing this is really missing is some lights in the mobile - I think that would make the mobile more engaging to the baby. Overall, this is a high quality Fisher Price product and perfect for baby!",5
4283,"We don't have the baby that will be going in this bouncer YET but we took this out and put everything together and it's a really cute bouncer that seems fairly basic in design and features. The musical sounds are pretty standard. Nothing special there. The fabric is soft and plush. I like that you can remove it and wash it since babies can have little accidents. I can't see any areas on this that would irritate a baby like the previous reviewer mentioned but I will keep an eye out on that once the baby comes in 6 months. Looks good so far though! Seems sturdy and easy to move from room to room. Nice product.",4
4284,"The Snugapuppy Bouncer is adorable, but the light color makes it necessary to wash the cover often.  Fortunately, the cover is easy to remove and washes nicely.  The cover is really soft and has thick cushioning.  The bouncer has a lullaby feature, a &#34;nature&#34; sound feature and a vibration feature. The lullabies and the vibration seem to be very soothing.  You can also make the bouncer &#34;rock&#34; back and forth by pushing back on it. A combination of the vibration and the rocking seems to help the baby fall asleep so Mom can get a little housework done. The three point restraint holds baby securely. The detachable mobile is cute. It can be used in motion or can remain still. The bouncer is rated to 20 pounds, but I think it is more appropriate for a baby up to 20 pounds.",4
4285,"My first impression was, &#34;Wow. That was easy to assemble.&#34; When I see &#34;Fisher-Price&#34; it means quality. This bouncer is  a neutral beige tone. I wouldn't normally purchase something this light colored for an infant, but the cushion is removable and can be machine washed. (I haven't needed to do that yet.) The baby is 3 weeks old. She is a rather &#34;wakeful&#34; child, if you know what I mean. :) The  vibration and soft music lull her to sleep. When she's awake, she's just starting to really look at the mobile. I only gave it 4 stars because the vibrating stops after about 35-40 minutes. When it stops, she wakes up. It would be nice to have a timer that could be set for shorter or longer periods.",4
4286,"fits well, not too wide, two pull out cupholders. my daughter thinks it's very comfortable and it's easy enough to buckle by herself (she's a petite 6 year old.",5
4287,"We have the Marathon for our 4 year old, and wanted to pass it on to our new baby, so we upgraded big sister to this Pioneer. I picked it over the Graco Nautilus. I was excited to find a 5 point booster by Britax at this price point. With another baby paired with the fact that, technically, my 4 year old can use a cheapo booster by now, I just couldn't justify the high price tag of the other Britax seats. To this end, the Pioneer serves its purpose, but it is no Marathon! The straps ARE cheaper. They are more of a rough weave, not the silky smooth weave of a seatbelt. The seat is much less plush overall. My daughter is less comfortable, but hasn't complained. Her head slumps forward when she falls asleep due to it sitting straight up. We put a towel under it to recline it just a bit because it is literally so vertical. When the Gracos all got recalled, I was especially glad I bought this seat, but if I had the extra money, I would just have gotten another Marathon.",4
4288,"I'm a Nationally Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician, or ""Car seat technician"" in plain english : )Let's talk about this seat!This is a forward facing ONLY, five point harness seat, that converts to a high back booster seat when the child outgrows the harness. It is only appropriate for ages 2 and up, as children who are under age 2 should still be REAR facing. This seat should last in harness mode until most kids are at an appropriate age for a belt positioning booster. It is outgrown in harness mode at 70 lbs OR when the childs shoulders are above the top harness position. That means if their torso height is taller than 18.5 inches, then this seat is outgrown in harness mode, and they then need to be using it in belt positioning booster mode.Children should ride in a five point harness until they AND their small bodies are mature enough to be safe riding in a belt positioning booster. This happens around age 5-7. Then kids should be in a booster seat until their bodies are big enough and mature enough for the adult seatbelt to adequately protect them. This happens around age 10-12, but usually closer to 12.**Only 50% of kids are tall enough at age 10 to safely ride without a booster.LATCH, or Lower Anchors And Tethers for CHildren:Lower anchors are only rated in vehicles to withstand a certain amount of weight in a crash. So after your child weighs 40 lbs, you have to install your childs restraint with a seatbelt and need to discontinue using the lower anchors. This is not a Britax thing, this is a vehicle thing. That is why this seat only allows you to use the lower anchors up to 40 lbs. You should ALWAYS attach the top tether, regardless of whether you install the child restraint with lower anchors or a seatbelt, as it helps protect the childs head and spine in a crash.Lower anchors can be used in belt positioning booster mode, in this seat, to keep the booster from flying around and being a projectile in a crash if the booster is unoccupied and not buckled in. It's a convenience feature.This seat, the Pioneer 70, is based off of Britax's very popular Frontier 90.It has the same function, but isn't near as easy to install as the Frontier 90, because you are NOT getting the ""Click Tight"" technology that the Frontier 90 offers. This seat also does not last as long in harness mode.. because the Frontier 90 harness is taller and has a higher weight limit.If you are looking for a seat for a very heavy and/or very tall younger child, THIS IS NOT THE SEAT TO BUY. You really need to invest the extra money in a Britax Frontier 90 in order to keep the child harnessed until they reach an adequate booster age.Also, if you are looking for 1 seat that you will be moving and installing in multiple vehicles, and need ease of use for the caregivers or parents that will be doing so, THIS IS NOT THE SEAT TO BUY. (The Frontier 90 is 150,000x easier to install. I'm talking instant, perefctly tight seatbelt install, every time, in less than 45 seconds.. with the Frontier 90.)But if you will never move your childs seat, you have a very tiny kid, etc, then this seat should be just fine for you. It's a little tricky to install, but it can be done. It's not something that I would personally want to be moving all the time, and I'm very adept at installing seats obviously.This seat does offer the Versa Tether, Safe Cell, and a no rethread harness. So that is super exciting. It's a nice seat if you can get it installed correctly and your child won't outgrow it at an early age.So to sum it up:This is a Frontier 90 without the Clcik Tight, and with a slightly shorter harness (This seat is 18.5 inches torso height for harness, F90 has 20 inch tall harness), and lower weight limit on the harness (This seat maxes out at 70 lbs, F90 goes up to 90 lbs)Because this seat is a lower limit version of the Frontier 90 without the Click tight, the belt path is weird. Where the click tight would be on the F90, you have to route the belt around that area on this seat. I'm not sure if that will make sense to you unless you are familiar with the Frontier 90 though..(If you are familiar with the Britax brand, this is the Roundabout in comparison the the Boulevard. Both are nice seats, but the Roundabout offers less features than the Boulevard, and is outgrown much faster.. sometimes too soon, and those parents wish they had just spent the money and gotten the Boulevard.)",4
4289,"Our little one only used a pacifier to help go to sleep.  As a newborn all the pacifiers would fall out, waking baby up, not letting mom and dad sleep.  This one stays right on babies tummy and would be there if baby needed.  Our little one no longer uses a pacifier but is teething and loves chewing on this!  Usually, I end up having to take this away just to dry it out, our little one loves chewing on the legs and playing with the whole thing.  The pacifier is sewn in and makes for a great chew toy, as well.",4
4290,"It's super cute but the stitching on the belly came apart within the first week even though my baby barely used it.",2
4291,"This was a neat little pacifier, we though that the lions mouth would open / close to allow for additional pacifiers of the same type to be switched in and out.",3
4292,"Our little munchkin loves his little lion buddy! He has busy fingers and it took him about a month to adjust to having something he could grab onto without ripping the pacifier out of his mouth, but he's learning and he loves it now. And he looks so darn cute with it!",5
4293,"I use the wubbanubs for sleep time...he holds onto them or even eats the parts of the stuffed animal. has stayed in one piece despite my son's use",5
4294,"I read the reviews and thought this was the answer to my prayers. My child kept loosing her pacifier at night and would wake up cring. We bought this thinking it was heavy enough it woudn't fall off of her. When we got it we were do upset with the size. Thought it would be a tad bigger. Well we thought it if worked then it was well worth the money. My daughter did not want it at all!!!! I think it is over priced for what you get. Great idea but not worth it for me.",3
4295,"I know some people find shushing annoying but it really works!  The 5 S's have been a lifesaver (Happiest Baby on the Block) and sometimes she needs a little more shushing to fall asleep after I leave the room.  We've been putting her in her rock and play awake with this on (and white noise) and it's made a huge difference!  We got it as a gag gift but it's been a lifesaver and well worth it!",5
4296,"It was always difficult keeping up with sanitizing and finding the nipples between the diaper bags, nightstands, and dishwasher.  Having extra parts has been extremely helpful.  I like that they are interchangeable with the low flow nipples and medela bottles.  The nipples are labeled in the plastic to differentiate the low flow from medium flow.  The mesh bag is good for storage or washing.  Great product!",5
4297,"I pump at work using the Medela Pump In Style Advanced electric double pump.  The connectors fit on nicely, the set-up for the connectors and the bags works very well, and the quality of the bags is excellent.  I both refrigerate and freeze using these bags, and they have held up beautifully, and have kept the milk very fresh.",5
4298,"I have been storing like crazy!  I was very intimidated by pumping straight into the bags at first, but once I tried it, it was so easy with the adapters (and you can still pump into the bags if you forget to bring the adapters... Oops)Easy to use!",5
4299,"No problems with these. Made for a good &#34;backup&#34; set of valves for multiple pumping setups between work, home, and travel.",5
4300,"I have two kids and have bought my share of kids' bedding in my life. This set is fine but the best part about it is the comforter. I have to admit I bought this particular set of bedding for my puppy, whose name is Dozer, because of the awesome giant bulldozer on the comforter. The sheets are nice enough but they are that extremely slippery polyester sateen, not something I would put my human babies on. For the price I paid it was worth it just to have the comforter, and if I was using this for my babies I would just buy a separate set of 100% cotton sheets to use along with it.",4
4301,"Bought this bed set to help transition from crib to toddler bed. My 2 year old boys love it. They point out every truck on the sheets nightly. The sheets are actually cute, less kid tacky then the bedspread. (Although honestly tacky is appealing to toddlers so it doesn't bother me). They are much softer and more comfy then I expected and have held up well in washings. And thanks to a recent stomach virus they had many many washings in a row.",5
4302,"I bought this months ago and was disappointed that my infant didn't want to use it more.  Fast forward to molars, and my toddler loves it because she can get both sides at once.  Easy for her to hold as well.",5
4303,"When my son was about 18 months old he started working on his second molars (now at 21 months old he still is) these must be the slowest teeth to come out, but this teether is the best. Its not to small, great for bigger toddlers (may be alittle big for a baby), And he can get it way back there to chew. After I saw how much he liked this teether I bought a second one. Would buy again!",5
4304,"My son likes this teether.  I will buy another one because we will most likely lose this one eventually.  That's the way it always goes",5
4305,"We registered for the beaba bib since it came so highly recommended.  And for what it's worth, my kid used them without any complaints.  But whenever I packed up her diaper bag it was such a pain because it was so rigid, I couldn't fold it up.  So I bough this to use only when we go out to eat, but now that my 2 year old has used this one, she refuses to use the beaba bibs.  Most likely because it's more comfortable around the neck and isn't as clumsy as the beaba when she moves around in her high chair.the only downside is that you can't just wash and dry with a paper towel.  The upper portion is fabric so it does need some time to dry.  I've purchased several of these so I'm never without one now.Also, we've gotten spaghetti sauce and other &#34;staining&#34; foods on the bib and I haven't had any issues with staining.  Which I was initially concerned about.  It tucks into itself nicely after the meal is over so it takes up very little room in my diaper bag.  All in all, this is definitely a 5 star product.",5
4306,"This bib is genius.  I roll an OXO Tot On-the-go spoon/case up into it, fasten it, and toss it in the diaper bag every time we go out.  It has more than paid for itself, and I always get a lot of compliments/questions about it.  Easy to clean, too, though I wish it would air dry a little more quickly.",5
4307,"We have used this bib for every meal for the past 2.5 months.  In the beginning, it contained more spit-up and drool than anything else, but now that we are introducing larger solids, it is definitely helpful at keeping things clean.",5
4308,"It does what it is supposed to.  You can't smell the dirty diapers and it is waterproof.  It fits several prefolds so it should last for an entire outing.",5
4309,"Very cute but not durable/made for the long haul. The seam that fixes the strap to the bag came undone on the third use. I'm now worried it's only a matter of time before the rest of it falls apart...",2
4310,"zippers are not as durable as they need to be considering parents have a lot of items they need to jam in and carry around. the tall zipper on the side ripped within 2 months.",2
4311,"I must say I had a small amount of buyers remorse when I first ordered this (sorry Amazon, but I found it for $25 less at another large retailer). I just didn't see how a backpack, made by Jeep no less, was going to cut it with a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn. But my over the shoulder bag wasn't proving to be big enough now that there were 2 kids. I read every review I could find on this backpack and decided to try it. When it got here, I thought for sure I would be returning it. It looked way too small for what I needed. But I am happily impressed! I love all the pockets!!! After filling the new bag with everything I had crammed into the old bag, I still have a ton of room left inside. I can easily fit more toys and clothes in there if needed.Two things I don't like about the bag:- there aren't any loops or hooks to hang things off of. I have a little bag for the pacifiers and a clip on container of bags for used diapers to go in. Have to find some way to attach them to the zippers I guess.- the changing pad is small.... Not a big deal since I will use the other one from the other diaper bagNeither of these things are a big deal, just my personal preference...... I still give it 5 stars!",5
4312,"I decided to go with this as a secondary stroller to take to baseball games and trips. Compared to the chicco and first years comparable models, I liked this one because it is lighter then the chicco umbrella and has a sleeker look to it compared to the first years. It came in grey instead of black which was unexpected but I really like it. The recline is great and it is tall enough for my 6'2&#34; husband. Happy with our choice.",5
4313,"I've tried a few varieties of burp clothes with my four month old, and constantly go back to this one.Pros:- the bamboo material is so soft and gets softer with washing (even softer than the Aden + Anais muslin burpy bibs)- the curved design fits well over my shoulder when burping and carrying around baby- the curved design also drapes over baby's neck well when feeding (I drape it over to protect the outfit)- classic gender neutral print- decently absorbentCon:- does shrink a little the first time it is washed (after the first wash it retains its shape)",4
4314,"If your looking for an organic &#34;non toxic&#34; toothpaste for your little one that is rich in Xylitol, has Calendula that soothes gums, is fluoride free, sugar free, color free, SLS free and  preservative free this is the toothpaste for you! It also comes in a bpa free bottle (ggod) that has a flimsy flip top head that I'm always breaking (bad). My daughter loves every &#34;flavor&#34; that we have tried. They are all clear regardless of flavor too. Yay!",5
4315,"We got these when my wife went back to work to keep up the supply for her pumping. The caps are a little nicer than the bottles that came with the pump.",5
4316,"I bought these to have extra bottles for pumping. I LOVE the new cap design! The caps are much more secure and better quality than the ones that came with my pump.  The bottles seem exactly the same, which was what I wanted. The fit perfectly in the cooler that comes with the medela pump.  I'm very happy with my purchase!",5
4317,"Perfect size for pumping and the new lid design is fantastic.  I have had zero problems with them leaking.One issue - I would say the measurements are consistently off.  Any time these bottles show 5 oz, it translates to 4-4.25 oz in Dr. Brown and Born Free bottles.",5
4318,"I used a Medela Pump in Style for 2 months that was a friend's who wasn't able to pump. I wanted to purchase my own pump and loved how this was totally portable and others reported this as super quiet. The Medela, even on a low setting, always hurt made me sore. During pumping I would have pain and at times would skip a pump because I just didn't want to be in pain. After receiving this I was very disappointed at first because it wasn't as strong as the Medela pump and I didn't feel like it emptied my breast. So today I emailed the company and looked into returning it, but I gave it one more test and pumped for 20 minutes like I normally do, then I wanted to pump what I thought was left with the Medela pump. Low and behold, I was empty. The Medela pump only got out a couple of drops. This machine is so gentle that I honestly was so use to the searing pain of a Medela, and thought that the Spectra pump didn't work. I cancelled my return and am keeping this pump! My only major complaint (why I only gave it 4 stars) is that I can't turn off the &#34;massage&#34; feature. Because of this, the machine shakes and is noisier. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I've read the instructions and pressed the buttons and it still shakes.Pros: portable, gentle, effective, quieter than Medela (but it still does sound like a pump)Cons: parts are expensive (but I knew that and it does work with Medela parts), you don't get a lot of bottles or any spare parts for what you are spending, I can't turn off the &#34;massage&#34; feature.Please post if I'm doing something wrong with the massage feature!",4
4319,"In the past I have used various brands of manual pumps and electric breast pumps.  I have rented hospital grade amedas and owned a medela pump in style tote, nothing compares!!First of all, Spectra is compact.  Comes with a night light which is handy when I'm pumping  and putting my other child to bed.  Has a handle so you don't have to fumble and its cool design.Secondly, the pump is strong and you can control the speeds and the pull.  I can't believe I didn't buy one sooner!! I really love the back flow membrane that is washable and prevents the milk from getting into the pump.  That is something you will NEVER have to worry about.  So I can even lend my pump to a girlfriend as long as she has her own collection kit.  How amazing is that!?!And thirdly, they have amazing customer service.  I had an issue with my pump, emailed them directly and they honored their warranty and sent me a pump within a few days.  Now that is a relief especially when you have an infant and need to pump.Splurge and get this.  I still think it is a better deal than the other brands.",5
4320,"A lot better than I expected. They fit nice and are absorbent. I have had a few leaks, but they were from leaving the diapers on longer than typical (long car trips, extended naps, etc).",4
4321,"The britax travel system is expensive but so worth it! You get a car seat base, the seat, the stroller which works with the car seat and on it's own... essentially it's all inclusive. The quality is excellent, the stroller is highly maneuverable, folds very easily, and is light enough that it's easier to lift than the baby in the car seat. I love it.Also, setting it up/putting it together was SO easy, which is always appreciated.One note is that I purchased black, but now that summer is here I realize that the grey or sandstone would have stayed cooler in the sun, which is important for baby's comfort.",5
4322,"Both the car seat and the stroller are really lightweight yet sturdy. The system is extremely easy to use and fits together great. The whole system together is extremely easy to push as a stroller, although with a smaller set of wheels up front we do sometimes get stuck in sidewalk potholes. Since I live in a city, three small changes and it would be a five: bigger wheel up front, better room for storage/carrying capacity underneath, and a better natural &#34;foothold&#34; for when I have to give it some extra *umph* to get over a bump. But really, those things are minor. Love this system!",4
4323,"We purchased this travel system based on its reasonable price and wonderful reviews, and we are glad we did. Using the infant car seat with the stroller adapter is extremely easy, as is opening and closing the stroller. The stroller itself is light enough for me to lift into and out of the car, and the overall design is modern, functional, and safe for baby - which is our number one concern. I give this system four stars out of five based on my continued struggle to remove the car seat from its base - with or without baby - although I blame this on human error, as my husband has no issues at all. Also, the car seat is not breathable, and we oftentimes remove our son from it with a back drenched in sweat - even if he's only been in it for a short period of time. Still, I highly recommend this system and would definitely purchase it again.",4
4324,"I did a great deal of research on travel systems and decided on this one. It was one of the lightest car seats that I could find with a super high safety rating! The size of this was also small enough to be able to put the stroller folded into my smaller car. It is easy to install and put together. The transfer from car to stroller is super slick. I really like how easy it is to fold the stroller up and put in my car. You just have to put the wheel lock on, push the grey button, and then lift the handle in the middle of the seat. The canopy on the car seat and stroller is a must have for our rainy climate too.",5
4325,"I ordered this for my daughter for her new baby girl.  It's wonderful!  She and her husband love it!  It's solid, easy to open and close and stores nicely in trunk.  The car seat is great and fits nicely on the stroller and easy to maneuver  even for me to do.  However, the baby has spit up on it and it is a pain to take the car seat cushions apart and clean.  They cannot be put in the washing machine and dried.  It has to be done by hand.  Otherwise, it is great.",4
4326,"Having had back and hip surgery I needed an easy to maneuver light stroller and this is it!  In an attempt to make it even lighter - I looked up the instructions for the UK model and I was able to remove the stroller seat so that I could use just the frame with the car seat and that made it even lighter! So if you are looking for a lightweight stroller at a good price this is it.",5
4327,"I'm onto my second DS with this! I love it!!Pro's - SUPER easy to fold down, and to unpack, handles really easily.Lots of storageSun canopy does the jobParent tray is greatReclines enough to accommodate all agesSuper easy to use with my graco 360 connect car seatCon'sI havent used the child tray yet (with the steering wheel) as my average sized 16 month old cant reach it (too far/high up)Tires struggle when there is extra weightAnd I have had to inflate them a few timesCan also be a tad tricky getting around small stores because of the wide back wheelsHowever all in all absolutely great! Wish it came in a double side by side!",5
4328,"Our 8 month old loves chewing on these balls or chasing them around when I throw them. I like how they are soft so they don't make that much noise like the hard plastic balls. For the price, I think this is one of our most used toys!",5
4329,"Right after I bought these blocks I read that around 5 months a baby starts to recognize pastel colors.  So I was happy I ordered these.  I really don't have a lot of toys that have pastel colors on them.  Most toys are bright bold colors.  It was true too.. she would stare at these blocks and seem so intrigued.  It was amazing to me how something so simple grabbed her attention the ways these blocks did.  She also loves to stick these blocks in her mouth.  The soft texture is great for that.  I am really pleased with this product.",5
4330,"My 7 month old likes these blocks but, at his age, the Fisher-Price Easy Stack 'n Sounds Blocks are a little better for him. He enjoys trying to pull the ball out of the center of the Fisher-Price blocks (which he can't). They (Fisher-Price blocks) have a nice sound and he can grab hold of them pretty easily.The Infantino blocks have a nice texture to them. He likes to chew on them but they are a bit harder for him to hold onto, which is the reason I docked them a star. As he gets a little older, though, I think he will like the Infantino blocks more and more as they will be more fun to stack (the Fisher-Price blocks only come in sets of three). The other thing I really like about these blocks is that they are all different colors and have different pictures on each side of each block. They are all numbered both in character (i.e. 6) and in dice dots (i.e. 6 dots). They will be a great tool for learning many different things. Obviously, they'll be great for learning to stack, but they will also be helpful for learning colors, numbers, counting and animals.If you are buying blocks for an older baby, I would say the Infantino are the way to go. If you are buying a right now toy for a 4-8 month old, I would go with the Fisher-Price blocks.",4
4331,"These are a little larger than I thought they would be making them hard for my baby to pick them up but she is getting better at it.  I like that they are a soft rubber because the first thing she does is put them in her mouth.  I would be afraid with the wooden ones that she would hurt her gums by biting too hard.  They are very cute as well.",5
4332,"Oh, the camera quality was definitely better quality than what we have right now. The detail was AMAZING! I could almost see every hair on her head, even in night vision mode. Albeit the picture, as good as it was was distorted, like it made everything in the picture fat, like it was stretching the image. Here's why I returned it- We have a complete wireless set up for almost everything and have multiple wireless devices working at one time, not to mention microwaves and streaming devices. All this was apparently an overload for this monitor because it had this weird flickering thing it did on the monitor which constantly had me worried we were going to lose the connection. The worst part was that the sound kept cutting in and out like every 5 seconds. It just felt like we were never going to be able to keep a secure solid connection, so despite the awesome video quality we returned it to stick with the monitor we have now, Samsung, which we have had now for almost a year and a half with no connection issues or sound disturbances.",2
4333,"I purchased this product 11 years ago for my nephew. 2 years ago I had my first child and my sister in law gave it back for me to use. She was memorized by it from day one. Now, I have a 3 month old and he, too, loves this mobile. The design has changed over the years and, in my opinion, improved. Mine is shapes dangling and primary colors. It doesn't match with any decor I have seen in recent years, but I liked the music it played and that it was a sensory toy, not just a soother.Yes, as it turns, the pieces clack together, but that only helps to hold my children's attention. Afterward, they happily fall asleep.This mobile has stood the test the time and still works like a dream.",5
4334,"I was so excited about these because I wanted something that was not bulky to go in my diaper bag to hold wipes.  I am so disappointed that the wipes dried out completely in a matter of days.  The outside of the bag was damp, too.  I do not recommend this for baby wipes.",1
4335,"It is really useful, not only for a wipe pouch but for many other uses, really like it. I would recommend it.",4
4336,"I purchased these training pants, as well as the blueberry training pants, so I provide a comparison here.  (I also got the gerber training pants, which are worthless for catching leaks since there is no plastic liner). The blueberry has a lot more absorbent cloth, and is softer and is clearly better quality. But these pants are 1/3 the price, and they both contain the leaks just as well.  Both will eventually become damp outside if my son has a big pee and doesn't tell us. But nothing leaks out (pee or poop) if he tells us shortly after having an accident.  Both seem to be comfortable, and my son prefers these to the blueberry because of the cute animals (we got the dog and duck). These also provide slightly less bulk under clothes due to having less absorbent material. Given the low price, these are well worth it.I ordered Large, and they fit well on my 24 lb (size 2T) son who is nearly 3. I think they would fit a large range of sizes (maybe 20-30 lb?)",5
4337,"In theory it's good, but it's too small to cover my baby's front. We end up getting food still all over him when using this one.",2
4338,"Where to start.Amazon has been amazing!! When I needed to replace my monitor and didn't have original packaging they still replaced it for free/ free shipping! LOVE AMAZON!!I wish I picked a different monitor though. This one just stopped working one day. Wouldn't turn on at all.The replacement works alright for what we need and I'm too lazy to go though the whole process again.It is always &#34;out of range&#34; when charging, by internet router or cellphones. It is rather annoying but holds a charge between putting the baby down for bed and when we go to sleep. I use my normal monitor over night and let the video one charge.It also cuts the monitor on when somebody walks, feeling the vibration I guess all the way upstairs? I dunno it's annoying.",1
4339,"This camera does everything the higher priced models do. I originally purchased the Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5 Inch Color LCD Screen (Baby) which lasted just until the warranty was expired. My grand daughter is almost 3 now so I wasn't as obsessed with getting the best of everything. I looked at several models and picked this one because it was reasonably priced and still had good reviews. I have had this for more than 2 months and have 0 complaints. The night vision is good, the sound quality is good as well. I am able to pan her entire room and watch her while she is playing alone. Since this is half the price of the previous model I had I highly recommend it. If I was doing things from the start again I would have purchased this model the first time.",5
4340,"In 2.5 years using the Baby Touch for my first child, we had dropped it a few times and the screen was in bad shape - a few cracks and a dim picture due to the damage.  I contemplated buying a second camera for it when my second child arrived, but decided to buy this whole new system because it is relatively inexpensive (and not much more than a camera for the Baby Touch) and if my damaged monitor went, I'd at least have one working monitor for the little one.  I've now been using the Foscam for three months at night and several times a day during naps.What I like about this monitor compared to the Baby Touch:1. Lightweight monitor - it's much lighter and the screen is plastic rather than glass.  It's more comfortable to carry in a pocket and it has survived a few falls already when my toddler's gotten his hands on it.2. Temperature display3.  PriceWhat is similar compared to the Baby Touch:1. Image quality2. Ease of setup and mounting3. Range / ability to detect the signal when I'm outside and the baby is napping inside4. Battery life - though I haven't timed this5. Volume control - neither unit turns the volume down as low as I would want it to goWhat I don't like about this monitor compared to the Baby Touch:1. Sound and video are controlled together on the Foscam.  I don't like this because I'd prefer to be able to have the video off and the sound on at night.  I thought the VOX feature that turns on the monitor when there is noise in the room would be great, but as it turns out that feature is always tripped when I have the noise machine in the baby's room as loud as I prefer it to be, causing the video to stay on, and making it hard to sleep.  I have therefore turned down the noise maker to stop tripping the monitor.  And still, the video coming on periodically disturbs me more than just hearing a few baby noises or the sound of a car that the monitor is picking up.  This is annoying when it's not a time I would otherwise get up and go to the baby as I have a harder time going back to sleep.2. At least a few times each day, the Foscam will beep twice loudly and display &#34;Out of Range&#34; on the screen.  I'm not sure if this is interference -- it will sometimes happen when sitting still on the counter and then flick back to in range without my doing anything.  I have also noticed it happening when I am touching the sides of the unit or I put it in my pocket - I believe I am getting in the way of the antenna.  I've never had this problem with the Summer Infant.3.  If the Foscam is low on battery, at 20% or less, it will beep loudly and regularly until it is plugged in. Sometimes I am downstairs far from the charger and it's not convenient for me to go plug it in - I'd rather have it run out its battery without the annoying beeping.4.  The Foscam power cords are quite a bit shorter than the Summer Infant's, so I need to use an extension cord with the Foscam, which doesn't look as neat in my baby's room.5.  The Foscam doesn't allow turning the volume off completely (unless you are using the VOX feature).Overall I'm pleased with the purchase and think it is a good value for the price.  The first con is the biggest for me - but I can deal with it.",4
4341,"This is a good camera, with one flaw which makes it not be a good option for us: the screen is way too bright to place by your bedside.  Maybe our screen was defective, because the lowest light setting was no different from the highest light setting.  We settled on the WiFi Baby because of how versatile it is.",2
4342,"This was the best option I could find for a sun shade that wouldn't block the baby's view of the outside world.  It works alright for keeping the sun out of his eyes, BUT it doesn't stay in place well and it needs to be adjusted every few minutes.  Also, it would be more useful if the arm was longer.  It really only works if the sun is coming from the right or left, not from the front or from above.",3
4343,"This shade does not work.  I read the reviews, and hoped I could make this work, but unfortunately, I can't, and I'm returning it.  First of all, this is TINY - it didn't even cover both my toddler's legs?! Also, it really does flap around with the slightest breeze (not even wind), just like the other reviews said.  Don't waste your time buying this, as you'll need to pack it up and return it...",1
4344,"I mulled over (ad nausea um) this and the Ergo for HOURS choosing a carrier for our 4th baby.  I chose this based on my previous love of our former Bjorn carrier.  SO glad I did!  It's easy to put on and my 3 month old loves to sleep in it when I carry him around.  We also took it to D.C. and my husband carried my 3 year old on his back in it.  Fantastic carrier- we made the right choice and look forward to years of carrying our boys around in it!",5
4345,"He fits in it way too small (7 pounds) I guess it will work better for bigger babies. But I don't feel any weight while he's in it. I guess I will use it often when he grows up a little bit. Only concern is that it would be hot in the summer",4
4346,"I tried this carrier at the store, and it seemed good, but after a few months of trying it, I went back to an old carrier I had at home.Here are some problems we had with this carrier:- Too much work to put on. Needs a lot of adjusting after my husband wears it.- Clicks are too loud. When I want to put my baby in bed while she's sleeping, she kept waking up because of the click sound.- Too massive and too large to carry in a bag.- When the baby faces inwards, the straps are right in her face (she's 7 months old).",1
4347,"We got this because our baby likes facing out.  It is way to heavy and hot.  I suggest the Ergo baby they just started to make a forward facing carrier.",2
4348,"All in all I love this carseat. I got this as soon as it came out because I was due the same month and there were no reviews. I have now owned it for almost 9 months and figured I might be able to share some things that will help prospective buyers. Here is what to expect -1. Compliments - I got this carseat in all black and it looks great. It is super plush and padded and much nicer looking than the previous maxi cosi model. My daughter had the flu this week and vomited in it several times. It was very easy to remove cover, machine wash cold, dry on low heat, and put back on. It looks like new everytime I wash it. The only thing that can't be machine washed is the canopy and straps, but those can be spot cleaned with some shout brand wipes (lifesaver btw!).2. Coziness - I have a large baby. She is almost 9 months old and weighs 22 lbs (thats like 98th percentile - we get &#34;healthy baby&#34; jokes a lot!). Everyone remarks that she looks quite cozy in her seat. Personally, I like this fact, I feel like when they are so small and lack muscular strength you really want something that will cradle them and support their little bodies. With my first daughter we had a Graco Snugride which was more spacious and she flopped around quite a bit in it. There is very minimal flopping with this car seat. The only con to this is that the seat runs a little warmer because it so plush and cradles the baby more. It took a little trial and error but we quickly learned that you cannot put your baby in microfleece pajamas and then in this carseat for long periods of time. We did this a couple times in the beginning and found her sweaty when we would take her out afterwards. Its not a big deal though - She frequently wears cotton footed pajamas with no issue.3. Base Size - We liked how the seat clicked in and out of the base, but unfortunately the base did not fit comfortably in any of the back seats in my Mercedes ML550 SUV. It fit in the middle seat but logistically it was difficult to reach the lever on the back when removing the seat from the base because the two front seats were blocking access. It could be done with a great amount of difficulty, but it was quite a hassle and just not doable on a daily basis. Fortunately for us, however, this seat can be used without the base. It is a little difficult to secure with a normal seat belt the first couple of times, but you quickly the hang of it until it becomes second nature. I was disappointed in the beginning, but it really is a small thing and I don't even notice the extra step anymore. Of course, I could have returned it, but I liked everything else so I decided to just deal with it.4. Weight - This carseat is light - At the time I bought it I think it was the lightest car seat option available! The whole point of getting an infant car seat is to have something to carry them around in that they can sleep in - as opposed to a convertible seat where you would have to wake them up every time you get in and out of the car. When you are buying something to carry them around in, you really want it to be on the lighter side, especially if your baby turns out to be a chunky monkey like mine.5. Canopy - Occasionally the carseat canopy will pop off. This doesn't bother me. Its easy to pop it back on. No big deal, in my opinion. The canopy is fairly long and does a good job of shielding baby's eyes from the sun.6. The tracks on the bottom - On the bottom of the car seat are these 2 rubber tracks that act like &#34;grippers&#34; and keep the car seat from sliding around on hard surfaces. To me, this is the biggest issue with the car seat. The tracks keep coming off on my seat and, unfortunately, I have now lost one of the tracks. They are difficult to put back in as they need to be pushed inside these little holes. The tracks can be removed, however, at your discretion. If you decide to just take the tracks off entirely you will need to be careful where you put your carseat down and be mindful that the carseat is more &#34;slippery&#34; than it was with the grippers. Now that I have lost one set of my grippers I do not put the carseat on any high surfaces because I do not trust anyone around me to be careful enough not to accidentally push the baby's car seat off a table, counter, etc.7. Stroller compatibility - We have the Uppa Baby Vista Stroller. We frequently use the car seat with that stroller. Its a little challenging to get the car seat in and out of the attachments, but its doable. Unfortunately, this is one of those things that doesn't get easier with time. Its just not a smooth transition from car to stroller. In addition, it is awkward to remove the seat from the stroller because it requires two hands to push in the side buttons, where the graco snugride was much easier to get on and off (one hand on the back, one hand on the handle). I suppose the Graco Snugride spoiled me a bit in that respect, but aesthetically I just couldn't get that brand again. I think those things are ugly!Overall, I think this is a great carseat and would not do it any other way. It is aesthetically pleasing, plush, comfortable, and lightweight. It has its quirks, but I am still happy with my purchase. Of course, there is no perfect car seat - there is only the best car seat for you! For me, the pros outweigh the cons. I wanted something that looked good, was functional, and a decent price. This was that carseat for me!",5
4349,"Ok these are cute and all but I really could have kicked myself because they are not worth what I paid.",3
4350,"My daughter adores her necklace. She just thinks it's so cool to have her own accesories. Her younger cousins always steal it.",5
4351,"I was disappointed with this item.  The handle ring doesn't stay closed.  The press bar to open the lid is hard to open.  It is easier and faster to simply open the dispenser.",3
4352,"Nice design, but it does not close very tightly to lock in the moisture.  We don't use our wipes from this dispenser very often (it stays in the diaper bag), and have found that the wipes dry out pretty quickly.",3
4353,"Very happy with this, wish I had bought it first!Pros:As compact as it can get and still keep enough wipes for on-the-go.Pretty airtight. The Skip Hop wipe dispenser isn't made as snug-fitting and the wipes can dry out.Wipes dispense easily, one at a time. Can't say this for the Skip Hop version.Cons:Currently have no cons! Great product.",5
4354,"From the photo, and description you're led to believe this wipes case holds a practical amount of wipes. It doesn't hold more than 10-15.  The wipes stay fairly moist inside, but you have to replenish after each outing. Also, the push top is not very easy to open.",2
4355,"I am using this as a wallet. No one will rob my wipes dispenser.I feel safer now. Thank you",5
4356,"The only thing this thing needs to do is keep wipes moist and available for on-the-go use: it doesn't.  It doesn't shut or seal completely and my wipes dry-out within a day.  If it didn't cost me $4 to return it, I would.  It's horrible, don't buy it.  Your better off buying the travel packs of wipes with the plastic lid on them for when you are out.  Such a bummer because the large wipes dispenser from OXO that matches this is great.",1
4357,"Perfect and sturdy and holds just the right amount of wipes.  If I could I would even make it slightly bigger! LOL",5
4358,"This is great for an on the go parent. I purchased this after getting so frustrated with the cheap huggies wipe holders. Glad I did because it holds way more wipes and can be opened with one hand. Awesome little invention that makes my life on the go one step easier.",5
4359,"It fits about 10 pampers sensitive wipes, you could probably squeeze a few more but I'm afraid it will pop open. My baby has sensitive skin so I have to rinse the wipes before she can use them so this is way better than zip lock bags. In the long run the case will pay for itself since wipes refills are cheaper than travel wipes",4
4360,"Very convenient to just put the strap on your stroller. It's easily to just take one wipe without the others coming out.",5
4361,"Love the button because the lid pops up and you don't have to worry about touching anything if your hands are dirty. We use water based wipes that are free of chemicals but they don't come in travel size packs, so this is great for the diaper bag.",5
4362,"This sleep bag is our life saver! When our baby was smaller, we used to turn the sleeves inside out (so, it looked like an actual bag without sleeves) which helped the baby sleep better (no hands waiving), and the bag was a &#34;swaddle blanket&#34; of a kind.  Now, we use it as a sleeping bag (impossible to use any blankets because the baby constantly moves while sleeping).",5
4363,"I wouldn't buy this again. I expected a much higher quality piece than I recieved. The hardware is metallic and feels cheap/weak while the decorative portion is kinda glued together.I wouldnt use this for a child older than about 2 or 3 months or they would prob destroy it into small pieces... ie: dangerous eating size pieces.",2
4364,"Color looks just as pictured. Deep rich navy. They are a little thin, but not ridiculous. And they wash well.",5
4365,"We love the comfy feel of the cream and blue swaddles, but the thing we love the most about this swaddler is how easy it is to use and the incredible design. Ergobaby thought of everything: the little arm-wrapping section, ease of tightening the outer &#34;wings&#34;, and the simplicity of the little leg pouch area.Some babies really like to kick their legs around and don't stay swaddled. This provides the perfect &#34;happy medium&#34;. If your baby prefers to have his/her legs tightly swaddled, you may have to look for another style.",5
4366,"I wish I had swaddled my own children, but we are using these for my grandson.  We have used blankets, other brand swaddlers and now the Ergo.  One night he kicked off the blanket and had it over his head.  His mother was not happy.  So now he only wears swaddlers, not blankets.  He has started rocking side to side so now we have started leaving his arms free.  We swaddle from the chest down.  Also he doesn&#8217;t startle as much as he did when he was brand new.We really like this one because we can raise the bottom and change the diaper with little disruption in the middle of the night.  If you have ever been &#8220;new baby sleep deprived&#8221; you know that is important.  We live in Texas, so this is perfect for summer with a short sleeve shirt and during winter would work with a pair of pajamas.The hospital sent a swaddler home with my grandson and this is something that I would suggest that every new parent needs.I did not see in any of the Amazon or package information that what is in the package is actually two swaddlers.",4
4367,"Due to the nature of the design, if you get this and like it, you'll likely find yourself buying the larger size a couple months later.  There's not much room for growth, but it does exactly as advertised - keeps the wee little one tight and cozy.  While I question and certainly don't take the &#34;medical&#34; claims for this seriously (some wacky claim of this swaddler being awesome because it allows for some movement that will prevent hip dislocation and dysplasia), it's still a good piece of fabric.  Trying to steep the product in medical science is far too common practice nowadays, probably because new parents always buy into it.Alas, the kiddo looks cuddly in it, seems happy, and can indeed move a bit, rather than being folded in a big burrito (which also works fine, and we haven't had a single dislocation yet!)  Recommended.",4
4368,"I absolutely adore this swaddler. They didn't have anything like this when I was raising my own children. Back in the old days (ha) we just swaddled our babies tightly in a receiving blanket, which, of course, always came un-swaddled. So I spent a lot of time re-swaddling, let me tell you! Now that my daughters are having babies, I am really enjoying all the new stuff that is coming out for babies, to make mom's, (and grandma's) day just a little bit easier.These swaddler's are nice and soft, and my babies seem to love them!However, I do think the price is a bit too high.",5
4369,"This swaddle has a unique design that ensures that baby's legs stay in the best position (the frog-leg position).  Other swaddles can be wrapped too tightly around the hips and legs, which can increase the potential for hip dysplasia.My only complaint is that this swaddle is too small to be used except on very small infants.  Our newborn was 9 lbs at birth and 21 inches long, and he grew too long for this swaddle within weeks of birth.  Because the sack that covers the legs is not fastened with Velcro or any other kind of attachment, a long baby will be able to kick it down so that his stomach becomes exposed.",4
4370,"Both our babies, now entering school age, were swaddled when they were little, and swaddling made a huge difference in getting them to sleep longer. If you are so inclined to try swaddling, the Ergobaby Swaddler Blanket has several design innovations intended to help the novice parent.Pros &#8211; Unlike other designs where you have to figure out how to contain an uncooperative baby&#8217;s arms, the ergobaby has arm pockets!  This is a critical innovation because proper swaddling is all about arm containment.  With fabric squares, and even with other swaddlers, it takes practice to perfect the right amount of tightness to keep the arms close the body without being overly constrictive, or so loose that the baby&#8217;s arms get free.  Truth be told, a large fabric square is all that&#8217;s needed to properly swaddle an infant &#8211; but that requires great skill! Unfortunately, there also seems to be a wicked relationship between sleeping poorly and having Houdini &#8211; like master escape artist skills that demand expert swaddling technique.  This Ergobaby swaddler needs less precision to get the same results.Cons &#8211; The Ergobaby swaddler is a bit bulky, so it might not be suitable for use without climate control (i.e., don&#8217;t overheat the baby).Perhaps not all babies &#8220;need&#8221; swaddling, but some babies (like mine) really do best sleeping this way, and the Ergobaby swaddler takes the guesswork out of the swaddling technique.",5
4371,"The design works great.  The fabric itself is very thick, almost twice as thick as other swaddlers I have used.  Consider whether the night temperature of your house is cool/cold enough before picking this one.",4
4372,"I am very happy with this swaddler.  It's a pretty pale pink color and very soft. It's easy to wrap her up in it...Please note that this is only made to fit up to 3 months, so be prepared, as it probably wont be a good fit after that.  I have used swaddlers before, and found most dont work as well after the first few months anyway, as the babies usually want to be free after that so this wasn't an issue for me. As far as similar items go, this one is a bit pricey, but it is a quality product that I would purchase in the future.",5
4373,"With number 4 on the way, I have really wanted to get this whole swaddling thing figured out. I just cannot seem to put a baby and a regular blanket together in a nice tight swaddle no matter how often I hear how beneficial it is. I was so excited to receive this product. My daughter brought me a doll and we swaddled her right up. She did not escape. I was a little alarmed at how nicely the doll fit in the swaddler as I expect our new baby to be a bit bigger than the doll. I think it will still be fine, and once it gets on the short side, we can always let her arms go free. I'm excited to use this at night and experience the wonderful trouble free diaper changes for myself. I'm sure that in addition to helping her sleep well, these swaddlers will also keep her from pooping and peeing out the sides, top and bottom of her diaper so we will never have those awful middle of the night wardrobe/bedding changes again. Score.The fabric is light and soft and I have washed and dried ours several times now with no pilling, shrinkage, or other ickiness.",4
4374,"As goes for all Ergobaby products, this one is well-made of quality materials with a forward-thinking design. We all know swaddling has myriad benefits and seems to be enjoying a renaissance, aiding in reduction of SIDS cases and soothing the fussiest of babies to slumber and keeping them there. Nevertheless, people have been swaddling babies for thousands of years by simply using blankets.Our new grandson loves to be swaddled and we've been enjoying these swaddlers particularly because they're simple enough for his grandfather to use! The &#34;convertible&#34; bottom makes a diaper change possible without removing the wrap, and the placement of the Velcro closures makes simple work of swaddling for even those without such intuition. Nevertheless, I know our grandson will be quick to outgrow this item, and will quickly become strong enough to wiggle his way out of the closures.There are countless baby products on the market... Why not keep it simple if simple works? I think it's wisest to learn how to perfect a good tight swaddle with an old-fashioned muslin baby blanket that our grandson can grow with-- even if it means his grandpa has to suffer learning a new skill.",3
4375,"Sleep theories for babies have changed a lot since my last baby 31 years ago.  Now I am swaddling my grand babies to help them sleep well.  I learned about this when my first grandchild was born 5 years ago, when my daughter and daughter-in-law had me read &#34;The Happiest Baby on the Block&#34;.  Everyone knows that a baby that sleeps well, is happier and so are his/her parents and babysitting grandparents!  This book promotes swaddling tightly as a comfort that helps the baby sleep better (babies are now ALWAYS put to sleep on their backs).  Those big swaddle cloths work, but are certainly not easy for middle of the night diaper changes and there is now some debate on whether the tight swaddling they produce is conducive to or restricts hip development.  Enter the Ergobaby Swaddler blanket...which seems to solve this problem with its patented &#34;healthy hip positioner&#34;.I am very happy with this product.  It is very soft and easy to use. Swaddles yet allows for easy diaper changing.  This makes a great baby shower gift too!I received the Ergobaby Swaddler Blanket Pink/Natural Small/Medium size from the Amazon Vine Program for my honest review.",4
4376,"I rated Ergobaby blanket 5 stars be because it is a great Swaddler. The fabric is soft and durable which washes in the machine nicely (low heat dryer).I like that the legs are still able to move and the arms are nice and snug. My baby used to ALWAYS escape the blanket and then the reflexes would wake it up! Not this Ergobaby Swaddler! My other blanket used to ride up throughout the night and this one stays put!Overall, I'm very pleased with this Swaddler.",5
4377,"I am very happy to report that at the beginning of this month, my wife and I welcomed our second son to our family.  In many ways I felt like we were a bit more prepared since our first son is almost two and a half.  Nevertheless, it has been a bit of a learning curve attending to the needs of two little ones instead of one.  Yet, I digress, when I stated that I felt we were more prepared with our second son I mainly am referring to what kind of products to purchase and what kind of products to avoid when it comes to caring for a brand new baby.This leads me to this swaddle, which in basic terms is a blanket that wraps around the baby.  Yet this &#8220;blanket&#8221; is sort of shaped like a &#8220;T&#8221; and has Velcro that allows the swaddle to stay in place so the little one doesn&#8217;t become entangled in it.  In addition, newborns are supposed to sleep on their backs.  It is part of the &#8220;back to sleep&#8221; movement in order to reduce SIDs (sudden infant death).I realize this product is for a 3 to 6 month old child and I am referencing my newborn son.  The reason being is because I have the same swaddle for my newborn and grabbed the next size up because it works so well.  This swaddle is soft, not too heavy and not cumbersome at all.  I can recall my wife and me struggling with several different swaddles with our first son.  We made a joke about it, since we both have graduate degrees and we were defeated by a baby swaddle.I truly feel this is one of the best swaddles out there, pretty much fool proof.  I am very pleased my new addition has such a comfy swaddle to sleep in.  Now if we can try and get him to sleep more than a half an hour at a time, that would be great&#8230;&#8230;..",4
4378,"I've always been amused by swaddles. The practice was common practice in Europe until the 17th Century. Native Americans used a similar technique in their cradleboards. And in the past decade or so, swaddles have made a real come-back.I won't argue the pros and cons of swaddling. I'll focus on my observations regarding these swaddles.Most swaddles on the market are single piece of cloth, much like an over-sized cloth diaper. Some wrap your baby with their legs out, others wrap the legs too.This one is more advanced. It's a but like a straitjacket. The baby's arms are tucked into flaps that resemble sleeves. There is a piece that resembles a diaper cover for the baby's pelvis. I like that the sleeves isolate the arms which should reduce clamminess and heat rash.And then there's the &#34;potato sack&#34; for their legs. You can leave that off and let them kick until their exhausted and fall asleep. Or put them on if it's cold out. They're spacious and non-binding so they can still kick a bit inside the sack.This design mostly restricts the arms. Torso and legs are fairly free. This alleviates my fear of hip dysplasia which is my top fear regarding the use of swaddles. But now I'm a little worried about what it might do to their shoulders. Should be fine, I hope.",4
4379,"I think mothers have been making &#34;baby burritos&#34;, with receiving blankets, since time immemorial....flip one corner up over the feet, wrap one corner to the left, one to the right and use the other corner as a hoodie..... of course the feet are sticking out again  in five minutes.  This little swaddler solves the problem.  Very soft, pretty fabric and washes up nicely.  Light-weight enough for summer.  I had never thought about it before but I guess leaving the baby's legs in a froggy position is a good idea.  Great that you can change the diaper without unfastening the arm part.I suggest you buy the larger size unless you can afford two sets. You will be amazed how soon your  baby will grow out of the &#34;newborn&#34; size.Now if they just made something, similar to this, as a strait-jacket, for the five-year-old. :&#62;)",5
4380,"This is pretty much your typical swaddle sleep sac with one difference, there is a zipper which runs across the bottom to make it easier to access the diaper for changes. I found this slightly more convenient than the traditional swaddle sleepsacs which place the baby's legs in a pocket. The sleep sacs are made of 100% cotton and are fairly lightweight. The velcro does appear to be strong enough in general to keep a younger baby contained, but I am not sure it would do the job on a baby older than maybe, 6-7 months.  The size large in this sleep sac I would suspect is made for larger babies and not necessarily older babies.",4
4381,"This Summer SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket is good quality and is adorned with cute little robots. This fits 13-pound our test baby very nicely and seems to be very comfortable.The robot design is nice and fitting for both boys and girls.Highly Recommended!CFH",5
4382,"I just don't have any use for the zipper functionality of this blanket.  I never left the baby swaddled up and unzipped the bottom to change a diaper.  The zipper doesn't detract from the design it just doesn't add to it at all.  The material is very soft and cozy, and the swaddle straps are just so cozy and wonderful!  My baby loves to be all snuggled up in it and I swear it helps him sleep longer and better.",4
4383,"I've found swaddling to be extremely helpful with my child, as have many other parents. But it's not all that hard to do with a simple flannel blanket (hint: just go to the fabric store and buy cotton flannel in a print you like), and this product doesn't make it all that much easier. Still, the fabric is nice, the velcro and snaps somewhat helpful, and it does achieve the same calming swaddling effect. It'd make a nice baby shower gift I suppose. It's just not the most cost effective way to swaddle, and the added convenience isn't all that much.",4
4384,"Some of the other sleep bags can be pretty pricey, so I was happy to find this one that was more reasonable. Having a zipper at the bottom is just ideal. It is wonderful to be able to change a sleeping baby after a feeding without disturbing the whole house. It is pretty light weight, so great for summer, but I'm not sure that I would use during the winter as I'd have to layer it pretty heavily. Overall with the great flexibility, inexpensive cost and cute designs... I will be purchasing more of these to give as gifts.",4
4385,"Our babies have historically not slept super well and this go around we are giving swaddling a try. In the past swaddling has just proven too tricky for me- I've never mastered a good swaddle. This time we have several Summer SwaddleMe products all washed and ready to go for baby. In playing around trying this out on a doll, I am impressed with the simplicity of the design and I think having this larger size (and it is HUGE) on hand will make transitioning much easier as baby grows.",4
4386,"I have used Summer swaddle blankets, wrapsacks, and wearable blankets for years and I love them.  While my favorite is the wearable blankets, I love these swaddle blankets when babies are small.  Many parents have trouble perfecting the &#34;baby burrito&#34; swaddle wrap, some babies (like my twins) manage to escape from even the tightest traditional &#34;swaddle job&#34;. These swaddle blankets do a great job of keeping baby snugly swaddled, and make &#34;escape&#34; nearly impossible.  I like the fact that swaddle blankets, and wearable blankets makes extra bedding in the crib unnecessary - which can help prevent SIDS.  I love the Summer line of products, and I always suggest them to new parents.",5
4387,"Babies love to be swaddled up tight.  the problem with this is that no matter how many times I practice, I cannot get the dang thing to stay on.  these swaddle me sleep sacks are great.  I can just lay her in it and fold the sides over her arms.  they velcro together and keep her nice and tight in there.  This summer one is great for right now, it's lightweight, so it's not too hot.  the design on this is adorable as well. They are easily washable and dry-able, but they do come out a bit off if you use a dryer.  i would hang this if you can.  I recommend getting a few of these for your newborn-3 month old child.",5
4388,"We have a 6lb newborn, and the Summer SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket is a little big right now. It still works fine, but it runs big (as other commenters stated). The colors and owl designs are so cute. Our 2 year-old son loved being swaddled until he was 8 months, and we hoped that this baby would like it, too. Our newborn son does like being swaddled, but he likes his hands to be up by his face. This wrap sack allows us to do that. I definitely recommend.",5
4389,"We got several of these in different patterns to add to this summer's round of baby shower gifts, and they were all big hits. Wonderfully soft, a very good weight for wrapping baby to sleep in a climate-controlled house, and adorable; I think the dancing robots are my favorite design out of all we bought, and not just because my partner teaches industrial robotics. ;)Pros: Very unlikely to block baby's breathing; the design doesn't let it come up over the face even accidentally. Versatile, in that you can partly-swaddle baby in whatever way he likes best at the moment. Zippered bottom for diaper changes.Cons: Velcro closure will catch on everything in the wash if you let it. Our family member closed the Velcro before laundering, and placed it inside a fine mesh lingerie bag (a thin pillow case might work if you don't have a lingerie bag handy), and said it was now fine. She did say that the Velcro still tends to collect little bits of thread and lint from thin air, but this doesn't affect function at all.",5
4390,"I love the soft lightweight 100% cotton (unfortunately made in China). This is the perfect wrap for summer months.The zipper at the bottom allows your baby to stay swaddled while changing a diaper. There are snaps at the shoulder and velcro for the wrap.The Large is a big wrap, big enough for a 14- 20 pound baby.",5
4391,"These young babies seem to thrive on swaddling for security, i think even more than the constant warmth. I have noticed that babies who constantly want to be held seem to really love this swaddle sack. I got to test it out on different infants while babysitting grand babies and their cousins/friends. All had different personalities but even the non-snugglers seemed comfortable in the wrapsack. It is easy to put on and you can leave the arms free for the older ones in this size range. Chubby baby or more slender the wrap is adjustable and it washes well too!",4
4392,"The Summer SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket in a pale Flower Burst pattern makes for a perfect swaddler. Babies love to be swaddled and this sleep sack makes for an easier and I think safer way to do just that. The delightful pattern is good for either sex and the material is soft and easy to use. With the bottom zipper, babies can even have their diapers changed very easily.I particularly like how baby can sleep AND be calmed in this swaddler. Keeping both arms in or not, it works either way and goes along with your child's favorite position. With the wonderful Five &#34;S's&#34; Program by Dr. Karp for how to calm your fussy baby, these swaddlers are great! If you haven't used those &#34;S&#34; words--Swaddle, Side/stomach position, Swing, Shush, and Suck, then you should look into it. We used it with the first baby and with a new one due any day, we will again. Now with this Summer SwaddleMe WrapSack, it will make it much easier.",5
4393,"I liked everything about this wrapsack except the zipper.  I know everyone else loves the zipper but I just didn't find it all that useful.  I typically prefer the one piece zip up sleepers so the zipper function didn't do anything for me.  If anything I just felt like it made it less cozy since it was zippered at the bottom.",4
4394,"We're using the arms-free configuration of this wrap-blanket. (It can also be used for swaddling, but our baby no longer likes it). It's comfortable, and does not cause sweating (i.e.: cotton material). And easy to use.So far I can easily recommend this to keep your baby warm overnight.",5
4395,"I ordered this Summer SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket for my 6 month old granddaughter.  Unfortunately, my timing was a little off as her parents had decided to stop swaddling her this summer.  The good news is that her parents love the &#34;WrapSack:&#34; feature.  A little t-shirt and a diaper under this garment are all she needs during the night in the air-conditioning.  I expect it will also transition well to cooler fall temperatures.  She is an average sized 6 month old and the L size fits her well, with a bit of room to grow..  The zipper at the bottom makes wet diaper changes much easier than wrestling her out of a sleeper (even with snaps) - great for middle of the night changes.  My children were &#34;busy&#34; sleepers and moved around way too much for a blanket to keep them covered - so I think this WrapSack idea is a great innovation for my grandchildren!  Depending on the baby's &#34;swaddling&#34; age and the season, you  might want to consider a different size, if you plan to use the &#34;swaddle&#34; feature.",5
4396,"I think swaddling is great for the first few weeks at home for baby, but it's been my experience that eventually swaddling seems to upset baby more than comfort and that is why this SwaddleMe WrapSack is great.  When baby comes home this is a easy way for Mom, Dad and Grandparents to swaddle baby, then as baby grows you can continue to use it as a sleep sack which is especially great for those sleeping diaper changes. The fabric is soft and comfortable, the print is adorable for any little boy andthe price makes it a good buy for yourself or to give as a shower gift.",4
4397,"I love the swaddle portion of the blanket.  It is so cozy for babies and I swear it helps them sleep more soundly.  The zipper function of the blanket didn't do anything for me.  I prefer zipup one piece jammies for my babies so it didn't do anything for me.  It wasn't like I could really use the zipper at the bottom anyways since I would have to unzip the jammies too.  It doesn't take away from the blanket I just didn't really use it.",4
4398,"The SwaddleMe WrapSack has many positive features, but my favorite is the zipper at the bottom. I can change my little guy's diaper without having to completely undress him. I've found that having him wear just a tshirt and diaper inside the sack is perfect in warm climates. The fabric is warm, but light and super soft. They run a little large, so the small would likely work through ~15lbs.",5
4399,"This didn't actually work for my son until he hit 10 pounds.  I love it now that it fits! It helps him sleep better at night and keeps him warm since you're not supposed to use loose blankets with babies.",4
4400,"This is wonderful, the material is very soft and loves the graphic transportation, and following the instructions it was very easy to use. Washed very well, no fading and zipper is easy to maneuver. The fabric is very light so perfect for a spring/fall usage in addition to summer.",5
4401,"This is the perfect way to swaddle a newborn without the fuss! It is easy to use and is made with soft beautiful fabric. This particular brand is a little thinner material so it is perfect for summer or warmer days. Get your baby to sleep longer with SwaddleMe! I highly recommend this for all new parents and it makes a great baby shower gift.",5
4402,"We got several of these in different patterns to add to this summer's round of baby shower gifts, and they were all big hits.

4403,"We have been using this SwaddleMe sleep blanket on our newborn daughter, and it is a winner.  It is easy to put on, and the bottom zipper means that diaper changes are easier also.  The fabric is on the thinner side, so this is likely not ideal for cold nights.  I didn't think I would care for the bee design, but it's cute and gender neutral.  This blanket also gives you the option of keeping arms swaddled or loose.",5
4404,"I really liked the material on the wrapsack blanket.  I didn't love the zipper on the bottom though, I felt like it made it a lot less cozy.  I understand that in theory it would make diaper changes easier since you don't have to remove it but I never really needed that function.",4
4405,"Can handle heavy bags, water jugs, great for diaper bags.  The velcro is strong and the green part is non slip.",5
4406,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased them.  I neglected to do so because I liked the pattern & have an appreciation for the Kushies brand.  I am searching for a mat to go under my high chairs that can be moved with the high chairs without scratching my floors.  This type of mat will not serve my purpose.  I am returning them.",2
4407,"This is a cute toy, but it has not entertained my son as much as hoped. This is small, and he outgrew it quickly. (By 12 months)",3
4408,"This is a nice light, quick drying baby bath sling. It is very sturdy, but with a little give to keep baby cradled happily. The 'wings' or wash cloths or whatever-they-are are very soft. The design is as shown in the pictures and is very pleasant to look at. Haven't gotten any baby poo on it yet, so not sure how that will come out, but it seems like it would wash out easily. I never successfully used one of the old wire and mesh slings, they scared me and I felt like I spend more time holding baby onto the thing than washing baby. I'm very comfortable using this one and thankful to have it.",4
4409,"I got a baby tub as a gift - it has a sling in it that lays the baby flat and somewhat elevated above the water.  I don't care for that so I go this little upright sling and it is a pretty nice design.  Fitting right inside the other tub, it keeps the baby's head elevated without slumping the baby into a ball.  As for the warming wings - you could just use wash cloths really, but the fact that these actually attach/detach keeps them in place and makes them a handy feature.Some ppl say their baby slides down but I don't have that problem, possibly bc I do the bath on the counter instead of in a slanted tub.",4
4410,"We have tried other bath slings and bathtubs with our newborn but so far have liked this one the best.  What makes this design better in my opinion from the others is the softness of the sling and the 'wings' that allow you to wrap your baby up and you can use them to help wash your little one.  Another feature I liked about this sling is the fact that it can be folded easily for quick storage.  I found it really convenient when we traveled.  It didn't take up a lot of room, dried quickly and made it easier to give our little one a bath while we were away from home.",4
4411,"The measurement is 30 x 30, which doesn't seem that big. But it is great to put on top of a baby or toddler in a car seat when it is cold. I use it on my son, who is two, in the mornings when it is a little chilly in the morning. I just tuck him into in the carseat and he sleeps on the way to daycare with the blanket keeping him warm.The colors are great for either a boy or a girl. I will be having a little girl in a couple of months so I plan on using this with her as well in the bassinet or just cuddling when cold.It feels just like a sweater, it isn't too thick or too thin in my opinion and it can be tossed in the washer as well.",4
4412,"The &#8220;American Baby Company 100 Cotton Knit Blanket&#8221; is a cozy, very soft cotton knit blanket.  The blanket&#8217;s knit is a stockinette stitch.  The gray, white and pastel design is a more sophisticated look than many blankets that are made specifically for infants.  The weight is light enough for warmer climates, but is heavier than the readily available flannel receiving blankets.This item is packaged for gift giving.  However, you should take care when snipping the threads that anchor the layers of the blanket together.  A ribbon that surrounds the blanket near the top fold protects the blanket from accidental snipping.  However, the stitch at the bottom portion of the blanket is done directly on the blanket&#8217;s surface.  Even if you use extreme care, it is easy to snag or snip one of the yarns making up the blanket.When washed on gentle cycle in warm water and then dried on the delicate cycle, the &#8220;American Baby Company 100 Cotton Knit Blanket&#8221; shrunk to 29&#8221; wide; the length remained 30&#8221;.  After only one washing/drying, the blanket showed some piling.  The edges remained intact.If you travel, this blanket would also be a useful item in your carry-on.  It is compact, but large enough to cover your arms and shoulders.  The design is not juvenile and the blanket is easy to wash.  Because of its dual utility &#8211; for both baby and Grandma &#8211; the &#8220;American Baby Company 100 Cotton Knit Blanket&#8221; receives five stars.",5
4413,"This pretty gender-neutral (pale green/gray/white) blanket is just the right weight for newborn summer use.  Other reviews mentioned it was rather small (30"" x 30"") but I personally like this size.  There's enough room for swaddling and because it is isn't bulky, the blanket is ideally suited for car travel.  It washes up nicely and retains softness.  The blanket is knitted cotton.  American Baby Company recommends drying flat, but I have not had any problems tumble drying it on low.  It comes attractively wrapped with a pretty gray bow.",5
4414,"This little liner has been great at minimizing the mess in the car seat when things go wrong!  From spilled water, juice and other &#34;accidents&#34; this liner has done a great job of catching the spill.  I would highly recommend this as an additional barrier of protection in your Britax.",5
4415,"The quality of the bottles and the sterilizer is great. And it works our cheaper if you get the set. Highly recommended.",5
4416,"We started with a sound only monitor with our first kid which worked well. When we had our 2nd baby and they sleep in the same room, we upgraded to the Summer Infant video monitor and donated our first one. We later added the Avent viedo monitor to use in our play room. We love both the summer infant and Avent, but we just love this Avent one a little bettter.Very simple to set up and use and the quality is awesome (crystal clear!). Once you used this one, you are hooked. A must have for parents!!!  Really no complaints.",5
4417,"The little music player device doesn't stay attached to the seat.  I haven't used it with it, but otherwise the seat is nice- even if I have to sit and bounce it for the baby to calm down.  He seems to be comfortable in it though.",4
4418,"Pretty decent value for the price. Easy to assemble. Wouldn't put a newborn in it though. Rather a infant that can hold up its head already.",4
4419,"I bought a baby bjorn babysitter for my home and I this bouncer for my husband's office so I had a place to put my baby down when we visit him. I have to say my baby seems to like this just as much as the baby bjorn which was a lot more expensive.",5
4420,"This is a very cute bouncer with removable mobil bar. The only issue I have is that it's hard to bounce. The bar to bounce it with is backwards. In order to boucne this with your foot you have to have the bouncer facing away from you so you are no looking at the child. If you want the child facing you, you have to use your hand and that wears your hand out. It's comfy and cute but it's hard to boucne. I would not recommend this product unless you want to work at bouncing your child.",3
4421,"My daughter has always hated this chair.  When she was little the head support was too high and now that she is older it just doesn't seem to support her at all...kind of pushes her forward.  Looking at getting a fisher price bounce chair.  Save your money and buy something better.  Wish I had.",1
4422,"Not too loud.there area lot of songs,a little too short but a lot.not too loud as expected.my son loves it",4
4423,"I used this to replace the wind up music part of my baby's crib mobile. I had to wind that thing every couple of rotations, it was so annoying. This mobile keeps my baby entertained and soothed without making me do unnecessary work. I love it.",5
4424,"This is a great alternative to the wind up ones. Know that this thing cycles through all twelve songs and doesnt just repeat one. I was under the impression that you got to pick which song you wanted played in a loop. The green button to skip to the next song seems a bit pointless now.Other than that, my son seems to enjoy it. It would be nice if there was a way to control the volume.",4
4425,"I wish there were more adhesives so the liner would stick better on the potty, but it is fine for what it is and the cost is reasonable. Great for bringing with me for trips.",4
4426,"Purchased this for a road trip I was taking, its perfect for little ones that tend to hold on to the toilet seat, slso when toilet seat covers aren't available for yourself.",5
4427,"The thought of setting my baby girl's tushie down on a public potty has haunted me since she was born and I knew that some day I would be potty training.  Yes I have a travel toddler seat to set on top of the public toilet, but with those your little ones legs and roaming hands can still make contact with the actual toilet.I'm not a germ-a-phobe  at all but with this I feel better having a barrier between my baby and the tushies of the rest of the world.  I love these potty protectors because they drape over the sides of the toilet and fully protect my girl from contact with the toilet.  I can set my travel potty on top and it's all smooth sailing.The box is a little big admittedly but I keep it in my diaper bag and since we don't use public potties on a super regular basis the supply of 20 has been lasting a decent amount of time.",5
4428,"This came in two large and two small parts which were exceptionally easy to put together. It fits great in our Chrysler PT Cruiser's back seat. For our car, the reclining feature isn't necessary, but it was easy to work. Our 4 1/2 year old sat in it and says it feels great. The strap sits at the correct level on his chest and the strap doesn't rub against his neck. I like that there are air cushions on the head rest for side impact protection. He has a tendency to fall asleep in the car to I'm hoping they will support his head at this time too.In our other car, we have a different brand high backed booster and my son says this one feels so much better to sit in.",5
4429,"LOVE this new seat! We have the previous booster, that has the IsoFIX - Rigid LATCH connection and it has handled superbly, so I was thrilled to see this new booster, with all the great features, like the air wings and side padding that GROWS with your child, and that can be self adjusted to different body widths, on this booster as well.Like the previous seat, it takes about 3 minutes to put the back onto this booster and install it! Due to NOT having LATCH anchors, it is pretty much sit and thread n use! making it great for older kids (I have a 7 yr old), who still can use a high back booster for safety, but want the comfiness of a regular passed seat!Because the seat is SO easy to put the back on/off, it is great for trading out between cars, especially when traveling! We highly recommend this!",5
4430,"The Maxi Cosi in Steel Grey we received is very attractive in terms of design and color.  This seat is for a 37 pound 3 year old who rather dislikes her current booster seat.  As a result, it is difficult to get her put into the seat each time we take her in the car...always sort of a struggle to escape and ride without sitting in it.  Of course, that is not going to happen, so she eventually gives in, but is never able to sit still.The Maxi is much simpler to install as compared to the older seat which is part of a 2 piece set that has the seat lock into a base.  Easier to manipulate and lighter to carry when it is necessary to move it from one car to another, we really like this seat.  Our girl now prefers her &#34;New Big Girl Seat&#34; to riding anywhere else.  Thankfully, we have had no accidents to test its effectiveness and I hope we never do.  However, it feels very secure, the belt fits across her comfortably, and the air pockets are a nice feature.  She naps without any problems.  One added benefit...she spilled juice on her new chair and it wiped up completely and left no stain or trace.Highly recommended.",5
4431,"This is my second Maxi Cosi seat.  Before this, I was a pretty big Britax fan, but I'm a convert!  This seat feels sturdy, was very simple to put together (maybe 3 steps??), and is SUPER COMFORTABLE.  at 5'2&#34;, I can almost fit into it myself! It was super easy to install in my rental car (a Ford Escape).  You just plop it in the seat, thread the belt, and VOILA!  I cannot WAIT to get it into my actual SUV since it's a bit bigger and the extra space will probably make it even easier for my 9 year old to fasten his own belt.  He mentioned that he likes the headrest a lot because he dozed off and his head stayed up.  The wings of the headrest do look much bigger than other belt-positioning boosters we've had in the past, and I like that.  The only thing I will say that may detract for some potential buyers is the IIHS rating - it's a great seat, but it may not provide the best belt fit in some vehicles, so check it first.  They have great instructions for ensuring proper belt fit.  In our SUV's, it's not a problem.  We love this seat!",5
4432,"love this for our girl. She enjoys talking to herself and using it like a phone.  I pile the bubbles on her head to show her how goofy she looks...",5
4433,"These bibs are huge and that's why I love them! They cover all the way down to my seven month old's waist and they also cover his shoulders and upper back. I've used regular bibs but have been left unsatisfied because my babies always seem to get food where the bib ends at the top. With the pullover bib there's a much lower chance of that happening. Less clothing changes and less laundry for mom!",5
4434,"These bibs are exactly what I was looking for. Our son just turned one year old, and the smaller snap or velcro bibs have been inadequate for a while. These are large enough to cover his long torso, and neck hole is also small enough that he hasn't yet managed to pull it off. The soft terrycloth acts like a great big wearable napkin, which is exactly what I wanted. It can be used to wipe his hands and face when he gets a little too excited about his meal.Note that these are not waterproof, but all the waterproof bibs we've tried just let everything slide right into my son's lap, where this will catch the mess. If you find that your little one needs that added protection, this is easily lightweight enough to be used over the top of a waterproof bib.",5
4435,"My little rider reports its comfort in sitting.  Cup holder linings removable to wash. Great seat, no complaints or regrets.  Side impact protection, good reviews, and latch system to keep it from flying around when he is not in it--these are the reasons we chose this one.",5
4436,"No more forgetting how many scoops you put into the bottle. Especially during those late night feedings. My son goes to daycare. This thing is a time saver in the mornings!!",5
4437,"This bra is a must if you pump everyday. Makes it so much easier than having to hold the pump yourself. Would definitely recommend to any pumping mom! I'm not sure what the difference is between this bra and the more expensive version, but this one does exactly what I need it to.",4
4438,"It's ok. At first I loved it. But after a while I find it starts to sag a bit. I don't use the straps but I don't think they would be much help. I don't even have a huge chest to bring the bra down. I just think it relaxes a bit in the part that holds the cones. I do like how the back is adjustable by sturdy velcro, never had any issues there.",3
4439,"I have been pumping for about 6 weeks now and I love this hands free bra. It is working great still through multiple washes. When I forget it I am miserable during the pumping session. I have a fairly large chest so I was worried about fit and if it would stay on and it does great on both accounts",5
4440,"This product helped me sleep a little sounder at night. Being a new mom I was (and still am) terrified of SIDS. This product helped put me a little at ease. It is small and light so it is not an intrusion on your little one, mine barely notices it. The sounds is loud and wakes me up in the night. Which brings me to the reason the star is taken off, we use cloth diapers and we double stuff them. This product does not work well with this setup. I've tried clipping it on different parts, clipping it on her button up onsie, pinning it on, etc. and have just not found the perfect solution. I still use it but with the understanding that I am going to have multiple false alarms, which is better than not having this device. Before we got this we received the angelcare monitor  that goes under the mattress. But with our setup (co-sleeping with a sidecar crib) it didn't work right. Then our friend got the Snuza monitor and loved it so the research began! I decided to go with Levana because it was cheaper. When it came I compared it with the Snuza and it is indeed the same exact thing a little different label but same buttons, sensor, lights, and options. I also chose to go with this over the Oma due to the added options which are well worth it in my opinion. I love that this can go not only from room to room but from place to place with us ensuring our comfort. One of my favorite products just wish it worked a little better with cloth diapers.",4
4441,"Love it! $ well spent. I was nervously checking my baby every couple of minutes. No false alarms so far, 3 months of use. Recommended to me by nurse in the NICU when we were finally headed home. Buying another one as a gift.",5
4442,"I bought this when after a month of struggling it was clear that my son would not sleep on his back.  Being concerned about his heightened risk SIDS now that he sleeps on his stomach I bought this monitor to give me a little peace of mind.  I love it.  It's easy to use, portable, and comfortable.  I have had a few false alarms when it's been dislodged in his sleep but I'd rather have it go off too often than not often enough!  My son is a mover in his sleep so a mattress monitor would not have been a good option.  The battery is an odd size and hard to find but Radioshack and Batteries Plus has them, as well as here on Amazon.  I'm buying one of these for my girlfriend's baby shower in a few weeks!  It's made trasnitioning my son to his crib so much more comfortable.",5
4443,"We have been using this monitor for two months.  It works great.  It is easy to put on as long as the diaper is on tight.  Our three month old likes to move around a lot so sometimes the alarm sounds but at least we know it is working.  We have not had to replace a battery yet.",5
4444,"We've been using this almost nightly for the past month and LOVE it! Our 1-year-old is in a co-sleeper, transitioning to a crib, and this works great for her. We attach it to her diaper and then swaddle her and put her to sleep. So far, no false alarms (like we occasionally had with the Snuza Go!) and I'm able to relax and sleep at night.The directions are fairly simple. The monitor is lightweight and the tip that touches their skin is nice and soft. The whole thing is easy to wipe clean with a gentle cloth. The batteries have lasted quite awhile already, and the green blinking light (to let you know when they take a breath) is nice and bright.Would definitely purchase again!",5
4445,"The crocodile toy is as adorable in person as it seems on here.  The wooden ring is the right size for my 4 month old's grasp.  The fabric just isn't the quality I was hoping for.  The legs are just a piece of felt.  Baby did enjoy the rattle sound inside and it is perfect for batting while on his playmat or in the bouncy chair.  He is at a stage right now where he wants everything in his mouth and this doesn't really work because the feet are too tiny and the body too big to fit.It is fine, just not the awesome toy I was hoping for.",3
4446,"very good product and would have no problems recommending it to other buyers, is practice when you need check all the time the baby only to take care",5
4447,"This is a great monitor. I cannot believe how far the unit can go and still pick up all the sounds!  I love the temperature component and the fact that the handheld unit can be used as a 2-way radio.  If I need something and I'm in the nursery I just talk and my husband (who has the hand held) and he can radio in to see what I need, it's great!  I also love that the handheld unit has a &#34;necklace&#34; on it so I can easily carry it around in and outside of my house.  The other day I was able to go to the back of my yard with it and hang it on the fence post.  I could hear the music that was playing in the living room (and the unit is in the nursery).  It doesn't always pick up the background noise though (which is really nice when the dryer is running down the hall) it just occasionally picks it up and you can hear what's going on.  The volume levels for the handheld unit are great too.  I really like this product!",5
4448,"I bought this after reading all the high reviews.  Unfortunately, I overlooked one negative that others had mentioned, that in the end, at least for me ended up being a deal breaker.  Its one weakness is the volume is far too low even at the highest setting.  I cannot hear my toddler when I have the t.v. on or even soft music.  The volume is far too low to be safe.  Other than that this is the best monitor I've found. I suffered with the Pan and Tilt Motorola for a year, after which the power cord broke (no replacement from Motorola) and the night vision stopped working altogether. The Motorola is a piece of junk in my opinion.The Infant Optics has far superior optics to the Motorola both in day and night and has all the functionality of the Motorola and the beauty of the 2 USB chargers provided in the box makes it easy to charge if you need to move the monitor up and down stairs -- you don't have to unplug the monitor each time.  I can't speak in terms of longevity as I've only used it for three months though the video quality is still excellent.Since I'm trying to night potty train it is important I be able to hear my daughter ask to go to the toilet. I can't hear her with this monitor so I will have to return it...sadly because other than the volume I LOVE this monitor.  Hopefully Infant Optics will fix it.",2
4449,"I just had my third child and our old camera was discontinued and you couldn't buy extra cameras.  This time around I really wanted a monitor that had a scan option.  This camera was perfect! I've been using it for about 2-3 months now...it has been working perfectly!  I tried this one and the vtech pan and tilt monitor.  This one was MUCH better.  The video quality cannot be beat! And I love that you can have a zoom lense. We use one camera with the zoom lense since the camera is mounted a bit far from my sons crib...I can seem him perfectly!  I currently have one camera in each of my children's room (3 kids ages: 3.5, 2 and 4 months).  I have it on scan mode all night, and it's been working flawlessly!  I LOVE that I can pan and tilt the camera...helpfully for the 3 year old! We also use the talk back feature a lot with the 3 year old.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a video monitor.",5
4450,"The beeping is annoying and super loud.  That is a huge con, which I wish had a volume setting, when the signal goes out on the monitor it beeps REALLY LOUD no kidding you can hear it all over the house it sounds like the house alarm and makes us think someone broke into the house....not cool!Other than that I do not like that the camera has to be plugged in to be used, we got this so that we could move the camera around depending on where the baby took her nap and found out the camera has to be plugged in.Those two are big complaints but bot deal breakers....for now.The screen is nice and big and I can see my baby even with very dim lighting also like how easy it is to use.  We have a townhouse and the signal is good all over.  Also I have not noticed the wireless interfering which was a complaint from other consumers.Oh and by the way you DON'T get the extra lense for free the way the picture shows...you have to buy it.",3
4451,"I love this cover.. So soft and plush. I have washed and dried it, and it has held its shape beautifully",5
4452,"For the price paid this is great! It is really nice to have so you can double pump easily. I love how easy it is to put on and zip up in the front. The only thing I don't love is the tie back, but I can deal with it.",4
4453,"I thought these things looked ridiculous before I actually tried a double breast pump and realized how hard it can be to hold both sides.  This really helps a lot.  It's a little awkward at first, but once you get used to it, it's a breeze.",5
4454,"A must have for anyone pumping! I can't live without mine now.  Great gift idea.  the tie back is perfect.  I am 34 DD and the smaller size fits prefect.  Any bigger and you'll need the larger size though.",5
4455,"I love this bra. I bought 3 of them when they were $9 each due to the great reviews and the price. I am a 42 DD(E in some brands) and once I got the ties adjusted this was a perfect fit! If you adjust the bottom tie to be slightly tighter than the top tie it supports your breasts quite nicely. The material is very soft and very simple. I have texture issues and can't stand certain fabrics but this felt very nice. There were a few spots in the back where the seams were a bit itchy but by putting the ties up under the band it not only olved the problem of floating ties, but the itchiness as well  Getting the ties tied was a bit tricky, but once they were tied I didn't have to worry about it. Now for the pumping aspect. I was able to pump quite comfortably with this bra. It held up two 9 oz bottles fairly well. The more milk that was pumped the more it sagged, and pressure was added but by 9 oz it was still held up pretty level. It was much more comfortable than anything I have tired to date. Very, very happy!",5
4456,"I didn't realize it had a tieback and it's slightly more cumbersome to put on than the more expensive version, but does work for me. The knot in the back will prevent me from wearing it under my clothes, but since it's a second purchase for washing it's okay to wear at home and use the other one for wearing out at work. It did not come with the coupon.",3
4457,"It will hold a Flange and bottle. But don't bother if you only have a single electric pump (I have single and double). The fabric is too flimsy to hold it onto your breast. The biggest reason I gave this 2 stars is I hate the tie option.  Forget sitting down while wearing it because you'll have a giant knot on your back and it's super uncomfortable.  I like the front zipper but I rarely use this bra unless I'm pumping while I put my makeup on. Can't wear it under your clothes or you have a big bump on your back. I don't love changing my bra every time I want to pump. Defeats the convenience factor. I want a bra I can put on in the morning for support and pumping through out the day. So, for me, It's easier to prop the bottles on a pillow so I can read on my phone or something while I pump. It makes me stationary while pumping but changing my bra/clothes 7-8 times a day is too much. I just lift and pump and it's much easier. I'm looking for a new pump bra..when I find one I'll be buying multiple but this one just won't cut it!",2
4458,"I bought a 3 pack of these replacement straws in January for $9. But my toddler likes to bite on them, so they get ripped up fairly quickly. I need another pack of replacements, but these are now $21!!!!!! Highway robbery!!!! What gives?!",1
4459,"Easy to replace the original straw with these ones.  They are the longer version so will fit in both sizes of the Zoli cups.  I still have problems with liquid leaking up and out of the straw, but I think that's a pressure issue and not related to the straw itself.  It's just the nature of how the cup/straw works.  If I don't tighten the cap as much it happens less often.  My baby loves these cups so I put up with it.",4
4460,"If you have the cups you will need replacement straws if he cups are used as frequently as they are in our house.  Definitely worth the money.",5
4461,"If you have the small 6 oz zoli bottle, you need to cut the straw shorter. In general it's okay",4
4462,"We bought this as a back up and as a travel car seat. We are flying across country but did not want to haul our heavy and expensive Britax Pavilion. It is very light weight which is nice for airport travel. And I hate to admit it but right now...i kinda like it a little better than my $280.00 carseat. We have a 4 month old bebe and in the britax she seems super uncomfortable, and it doesn't seem to recline enough. This seat reclines a little better and fits her small body a little better. It doesn't seem as high quality and heavy duty as the Britax though. As you can see it is a super basic seat, no bells and whistles but secure. It also takes up less space than the Britax. Installation was easy enough once we found the instructions. At first I didn't think it came with any but then they were discovered tucked into the side of the seat. In all I think it is a nice back up for us. It is spacious enough that our little one will fit in it for a long time.",4
4463,"We bought this car seat to use on the airplane or take with us when we travel by train.  Overall for the price I would recommend this car seat.  I cannot necessarily speak to the ease of use in the car since I have only installed this twice (using the seat belt) since we live in NYC and rarely travel by car. Installing is a bit time consuming since you have to loop through the bottom of the seat and adjust the position and seat belt to keep from sliding.As for the travel this car seat is super light and served its purpose.  Below are the pro's and cons in regards to traveling with the car seat:Pros:- Approved for airplane use- Width of the seat allows the car seat to be rolled with baby in tow through the airplane aisle easily using the Go Go Babyz Kidz Travel Mate.  Based on my research several of the other car seats cannot be rolled through the aisle so this is a big plus.- Super light - I sometimes travel by myself with my to ddler (with the Go Go cart mentioned above) and am able to handle the car seat and two shoulder bags.- Fairly easy to install on airplane (see cons list for my comments on this)- Toddler seems comfortableCons:- When installing on the airplane you have lift the car seat cover/pad and loop the belt through so you cannot install on the airplane while the child is in the seat.  This proves to be a little difficult with a curious toddler who will not sit still but it can be done.  I also have to take the child out to uninstall the seat.  There may be a better way to do this that i have not discovered yet.- If using for the car the seat when rear faced is quite upright vs. my parents have the Chicco where it reclines a bit allowing the baby to sleep better and the Chicco seems a bit more sturdy.  However, the Chicco is much more expensive and much heavier.Overall, I would highly recommend this car seat given the price and ease of use when traveling.",4
4464,"My baby boy loves it,it is so cute and soft.he is playing with it and it is easy to find it",5
4465,"This is hands down the best teether we have found! My daughter loves chewing on this even when she isn't actively teething. We have given them as gifts and they have been big hits with the other babies as well.",5
4466,"This changing pad cover is a nice chevron that matches my baby's room. However, the fabric is a bit stiffer cotton (low thread count, maybe?), so if you're looking for a soft fabric, this may not be the best.",4
4467,"Looks great in the nursery, fits a standard changing pad. Has held up well with multiple washings. It's pretty true to mint green, beautiful color.",5
4468,"I bought this after using one of those &#34;cute&#34; frog toy collectors that &#34;suctions&#34; to the shower wall. No. It doesn't, in case you're wondering. It's awful. I ended up just using the toy scoop minus hanging it on the wall. It became very annoying because the stupid thing always fell over. I bought this a couple of weeks ago at Buy Buy Baby and used a $5.00 coupon, so I ended up paying $10.99 for mine. It has been awesome! I  peeled the little stickers off the &#34;hook,&#34; stuck it to the shower wall, and BAM! It's there, not coming off! So easy to gather up toys and then hang the basket back on the hook. I love it. The only thing I'd recommend is using a level when putting it on your wall because mine turned out a little crooked which is driving me nuts, but that's a user error, obviously. Love this thing. We do not use that show, however, so I can't tell you how steam from the shower might affect the adhesion.",5
4469,"We were looking for a compact, lightweight stroller to use for short trips with my son. This had all the features I was looking for (big canopy, reclining back rest, lots of storage, and lightweight) and was much cheaper than the UppaBaby G-Luxe we were also considering. The cup holder isn't my favorite as it is a bit awkward for holding drinks, but otherwise, we love this stroller. Very happy with our purchase.",5
4470,"Easy for my LO to grab but doesn't stay cold for very long...  a few minutes max.  Not made in China is a huge plus for me!",3
4471,"These cups are great for the price. Each cup has a different design on the bottom and different configuration of holes for water to come out of. Baby has a lot of fun with them!",5
4472,"Our baby girl has been enjoying these cups since she was a newborn. Now at 9 months she is still more interested in mouthing them and banging them against one another, rather than stacking them. These cups usually occupy her for at least a couple of minutes.The colors are very cute. They are safe and light. We are confident that she will continue playing with the cups for months to come and will perhaps start stacking them very soon.Happy with the purchase and would buy again!",5
4473,"I use these in the high chair, the stroller and the car seat. They're great all around! I wish they were a little longer, but I'm guessing they don't want children to accidentally strangle themselves. So you should make sure that you aren't looking for a really long strap.",5
4474,"Great idea to keep toys from flying out of carts and strollers!  My baby loves to throw his toys and this keeps them from hitting the floor.  They have several choices for where to put the snaps so you can adjust the lengths easilyHighly recommend.",5
4475,"Although I love this teether and love that it's all natural and safe for my little one to chew on, he's not super crazy about it.  Which isn't the companies fault.  Each child is different.  He does hold onto it for a while though so it is a perfect size for little hands to grip onto.  Easy to wash.  Like most rubber toys, it does attract fuzz and crumbs easily.  But again, easy to clean.",4
4476,"My 7 month old son does enjoy this teether, not as much as his others (yet). He doesn't have the dexterity to squish it flat and play with it, but I think he will soon. I love that its natural rubber and easy to wash.",5
4477,"This latex has a weird white film on it.  It seems easy to grab but when baby hands grip the ball it makes it awkward to chew.  Skip this one. Go fir comotomo or natursutten star instead.",2

4479,"I honestly do not know why someone would spend more money on a different bouncer. This bouncer is great. We used it from about 2 to 10 months of age. My son loves the toy monkeys, which we still use today since they detach from the bouncer.",5
4480,"If you want a set of muslin blankets to use to actually swaddle your infant, I found these Hudson Baby blankets to be superior to aden + anais. They are made of a stretchier material, which I think facilitates a tighter swaddle. They are large enough to make all of the folds and tucks.",5
4481,"Love these. They are so big and I love that because I can still swaddle my chubby three month old with no problem. They are super lightweight which is perfect for the summer. I love the cute designs as well!",5

4483,"*** I did NOT receive a free stroller in exchange for my review. I purchased this stroller after shopping around and comparing features and reviews for about a week.I was apprehensive about this purchase because all of the reviews were seemingly by people who'd been given a free stroller in exchange for a review. Unfortunately, my #1 priority was a parent-facing seat and those are hard to come by so I took the chance on this one anyway. Some of my problems with this stroller are difficult to describe but I'll try. All of my problems with this stroller seem to stem from one major design/construction decision: all the moving/mechanical/joint parts are made of plastic while the cosmetic, static parts are made of metal.CONS1. Right out of the box, 3 wheels clicked and locked into place with ease, but the fourth had to have a lot of pressure applied to get it to lock on. I practically had to slam the stroller down onto the wheel to get the lock to click.2. The handle bar has a lot of give in it. Whenever I had to pop the stroller on its back wheels to get over a curb or up/down stairs, it wiggled a lot and when I put any amount of pressure onto it, it felt like it might just break off entirely. And my baby is only 15 lbs right now.3. About a week after getting the stroller home, we were collapsing it to get it in the car and one of the buttons you press to remove the seat from the base broke. It still functioned but it jiggled so that it was only a matter of time before it popped off completely.4. Yesterday, I collapsed the stroller and put it in the car to go run some errands and when I pulled it back out of the car and tried to set it up, the seat's pivot mechanism was completely jammed. The seat simply would NOT rotate back up to an upright position, rendering the stroller, finally, after three short weeks, completely useless.5. The sun shade is crap...no other word for it really. It only shades the sun when the kid is facing the opposite direction. If the sun is directly overhead or at any angle in front of the seat, forget about it. Of course, this problem is a pretty universal one among strollers under $300 and I expected it.PROS1. Assembly was a breeze.2. This stroller doesn't roll...it glides. So easy to push and even handles gravel and grass pretty well.3. The parent facing seat...a major plus given how few affordable options their are for this feature.4. It's pretty sexy looking.I returned this stroller within a month. It wouldn't have been worth $50, much less the $242 I paid for it...and I bought a USED-LIKE NEW one. Definitely not worth retail.",1
4484,"These were different than what came with my bottle starter package and I hate these. The sponge comes off after first use. I bought them twice thinking maybe the first one was defective but had same problem.",1
4485,"It is a bottle brush... what you would expect.The nipple brush is great, the bottle brush is a bit wider than it needs to be (and I have wide bottles) but its good.",4
4486,"so big ,haha ,this is a good brush,i have not used it,but i believe this born free bush is good",5
4487,"My toddler is a tough one... She is such a picky eater that often she'll only eat baby food pouches - and only if allowed to eat while walking around (ridiculous). Anyway, that's fine, until she decides she is done with whatever pouch she has and tosses it across the room or squeezes it all over my carpet. *sigh* But these - these are genius! I have had them for about a week so far, and I have not had to spot clean my carpet once since! No more drips, no messes on my carpet! My carpet and my sanity are saved because of these things! And, the little attached cap part is great for on the go. Love them.",5
4488,"I ordered 2 packs based on the great reviews - this cap sounded great, I couldnt wait to try these.But i don't get it.  Baby gives one good squeeze and the food squirts right out the choomee cap.  Did nothing to control mess, I may as well have given her the pouch without the choomee cap.  Have 4 of them (being so excited by the good reviews and all) so I tried different caps to make sure I didn't just have a defective one.  Sadly, nope.Don't waste your money.",1
4489,"My daughter absolutely loves these! They are great even when she is not actively teething. Highly recommend for babies and toddlers.",5
4490,"I love that the mallet to hit the notes with is attached to the alligator via a string.  One less thing for me to go searching for and keep track of!  My twins are 12 months, and while this product says its for 18 months and up, they've been playing with it for several months already and enjoy it.  I didn't realize until I received it that if you pull the alligator by the mallet and cord as a pull toy that the mouth of the alligator chomps up and down- pretty cute and fun!  I think this is one of the toys that will stand the test of time, it seems pretty well made and durable.",5
4491,"I bought these for my son and he absolutely love them. The quality is great because he can chew and chew and chew on these and nothing has happened to them!",5
4492,"He loves to chew on this teether.  He likes the fact that this has a sleeve on it cause it gives him something else to play with!",5
4493,"I had thought this little nap pad would make a nice addition to have on hand for little ones needing a nap. Sadly, the product is better in concept than in implementation.It is narrow and long, so if your toddler tosses and turns, this may not be the right choice, but it will handle a taller toddler with no problem.The Good:The blow up portion slides in and out easily making this washable.It has a nice wide fleece covering, that will go over your toddler when he/she is laying on it.Colors are nice.Once it is blown up, it makes a nice pad.The head portion seems very nice to lay your head down.The Bad:After 10 minutes of pumping on the pump, it only had the tiniest amount of air. (To those who are wondering YES I had the emptying part closed. Yes I wore shoes. Yes I pumped and pumped and pumped).I finally gave up and opened the back and blew it up myself. It only took about 4-5 large breaths. It is possible the pump was defective, but I a unable to tell since it is completely enclosed within the mattress.So yes to the product, no to the pump. Since the key factor here seems to involve being able to pump it up in 40 seconds with your foot, I probably would look around to find something that met my needs, unless you aren't adverse to blowing it up yourself.",3
4494,"This is my second Summer Infant Dual View Video Monitor. I really love the range (can use it while sitting on the deck outside and baby is inside), quality of the image and convenience of being able to monitor more than one child at a time.

4497,"My 8 month old son loves to cruise around the kitchen in this. He is 40% for height but wasn't tall enough to start using it at the shortest setting until 7 months. There are 3 height setting total. He loves the toys it comes with and you can move them out to put other toys on the tray. It cleans easy too. It works best on the tile but he scoots around on our average-thickness carpet too.",5
4498,"This is cute and good quality. I would have given it 5 stars but it doesn't go down low enough for either of my babies to touch the floor. One is 6 months and the other is 9 months. In it's defense, my 9 month old is rather small. Still, I feel the optimal time to use this is 6-12 months and this model I would say only works for 9-12 month olds. IT still works to sit them in but they can't walk around like they like.",4
4499,"Very nice quality and colors. I especially like that they have snaps. Most bibs come with hook and loop which can scratch baby's neck. I took 2 stars off because the waterproof layer makes a crinkle noise ALL THE TIME! It's very annoying; it could have easily been replaced with PUL or any other quiet waterproof fabric.",3
4500,"Baby is 6-months-old and has majorly bad vomiting issues. He can vomit anytime (before, during and after feedings). During feeds, we use a cloth diaper to catch the regurgitation, but in between feeds, we cannot practically keep the cloth diaper tucked in him. Baby's clothes were getting covered in vomit all the time. I am a lazy mom who doesn't want to change and launder his little outfit 10-15 times/day. Sometimes, I left him in his vomity clothes when we were out of the house and there wasn't a decent place to change his clothes... baby mama! So, we went in search for a good all-the-time bib. We initially bought thegreen sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs , Boysones, which were decent enough, but we wanted something bigger and even more waterproof.We love these bibs from Maxy Moo Moo. The box that it came in is beautiful and sturdy, but rather unncessary. Would the cost of these bibs to lower without such a fancy box?Anyway, back to the bibs. The colors are vibrant and there is always at least one bib that coordinates with Baby's outfit, without drawing attention away from the outfit itself.But best of all these bibs actually work! They are truly waterproof (or vomit-proof, in our case). It's much easier to change out the bib than an entire outfit each time Baby vomits. They are also pretty absorbant, so the vomit doesn't merely slide off the bib to his outfit.To launder these, we gently rinse them in the sink first before putting them in the washing machine. We hang them up (indoors) to dry. They dry overnight. Only thing is that I wish they didn't include the two white bibs, as they tend to stain a little bit. Colors are better.They do have a bit of a crinkly sound, but I think Baby actually likes the sound because he often grabs at the bib to hear the crinkle. So, it's a bib... and a little toy... all in one! Woohoo... for those times I forget to bring a little toy for him in the diaper bag or forget to give him a toy before driving. He actually smiles at the sound of the crinkling.To sum it up...Pros:-Vibrant colors-Easy to launder and dry-Good size (large, but not too large)-Waterproof (and vomit-proof)-Absorbant-Crinkly-Way easier to change than an entire outfit! Yippee!Cons:-Beautiful box, which probably adds to the cost-Easily stainable white bibs (2)",5
4501,"I have 8 month old twins and they make a lot of mess.  After feeding, I always have to wash and dry it before using it again. Since the material is cotton like, its not easy to wash/wipe for another use.  So if going out or don't have a lot of time, you'll need multiple bibs for more than one feeding. However, if your baby is bottle fed, it would be a good choice.  The material is good quality and I like how soft it feels.",3
4502,"Needed bibs that were a little bigger since my granddaughter is a year old now.  These are working fine.  Colors are very nice.  It is nice that there are two snaps.  We have to use the last snap.  makes it easy on, easy off.  They do not stick to anything in the washer like velcro does.  Now, the velcro ones have their place (and I bought those and they worked well ) but we have moved on and these are working now.  Not too long.  The problem will be that the neck hole will become too small for her before we are ready to quit wearing bibs.  Hard to find bigger ones.  Do recommend these.",5
4503,"These bibs are a bargain, and work out great for us.  First, only cotton (or metal snap) comes in contact with my son's skin. He gets rashes from velcro closures, no matter how careful we are with them.  Second, the adjustable closure (2 sizes) is a godsend.  Our son is really big for his age, and most bibs are uncomfortably or at least annoyingly too snug on him.  These fit with a little room to grow on the bigger setting.  Overall, very happy with them. Came in a nice box, and 10 for approx. $30 was the best deal I could find on something that would work for us.",5
4504,"So pleased with this tub. It obviously takes up much more space than the flat sponge we were using for our little guy, but he loves this so much better because he doesn't have to lie completely flat. We got this when he was almost 4 months, so we never used the sling and just went straight to the reclined bathing position. It's perfect. When this is dry (outside of the tub), I also let him sit in the supported sitting position just for fun, and he is so proud of himself to be able to sit up on his own! Soon I'll use that position to actually bathe him, but for now, he's a little too wobbly and he likes the reclined position better...plus it feels safer, when he's all slippery soapy!Would absolutely buy again!",5
4505,"I have been using this for my baby since she had her first bath. She's now 2 months old, and we are still using the newborn sling. I love that I can hang this up when we are done using it. Great product!",5
4506,"This was such a great purchase I just cant say enough good things about this product. I know, I know, &#34;it's just a plastic tub&#34; but really its more than that and it grows with your child. The sling works great for newborns, you can then transition them into the seat and then into just the tub itself with out the seat insert. It makes it so much easier to bath our daughter and I think she enjoys it much more as well. She looks forward to her baths and gets excited when she knows she is getting in her tub. The 2 accessories work just fine, the orange fish works really well for gently rinsing hair and the blue bottle for sort of &#34;squirting&#34; water in a shower head manner on them. Honestly we dont use them every time because a small plastic cup is just faster. I would also suggest turning the tub upside down once you are done to let it air dry because the way the drain is position it does not drain &#34;perfectly&#34;. We prop a wash cloth under the front to help with the drainage but its still not perfect nor a big deal.",5
4507,"I love this potty seat. It snaps on easily and is the perfect size for my daughter. The only issue I have is that she can easily pop it off. I wish it held on a little tighter, but after telling her not to pull on it a couple times, she mostly leaves it alone.I absolutely love the back rest and the side handles. Everything is so well thought out for what a toddler needs.",4
4508,"Baby seem to love it, spend a lot of time kicking the giant keys and staring the mirror hung on the bar. The mat seems to get warm so i just place the whole thing inside the crib and prop it with a pillow.The music tracks feel a bit limited though.",5
4509,"My son really enjoys it when he's in the mood to play. However, I just wish the mat was a bit thicker so it's softer. But other than that it's great so far. He loves to kick so we thought he might as well play some tunes! He dislikes the mirror though, he prefers watching himself in a real mirror during bath time!",4
4510,"This gym is very nice and well thought out. There isn't as much room to move around as with a Gymini, but this gym is more versatile and entertains babies with sights and sounds from infancy until they're toddlers.There are four hanging toys and mirror overhead, which are nice but of course the piano is the best part. It has a piano mode and a music mode and 2 volume settings. There are four huge white keys which are the perfect size for little feet and hands (the black keys don't play). The gym can even be converted into a tummy time gym, with the toys being attached to the pad while the piano can still be kicked. Later on when the baby can sit up, they can play the piano sitting up as well.Needless to say, this gym is best used on carpet instead of atop hard floor since the pad is thin. When the baby outgrows the gym you can detach the piano, which is lightweight and has a handle for easy carrying. A handy and worthwhile investment, 5 stars.",5
4511,"This is really a neat play mat with lots of gadgets to entertain a little one. The little piano detaches for a take-along toy when the child becomes mobile.  I think my new granddaughter will enjoy it a lot, and it has longer-term use since they won't outgrow it just because they no longer need to lie down and play.",5
4512,"I have to say that our daughter loved this play mat and has a great time kicking the keys to play the piano. The toys were very accessible to her. I was amazed at long our daughter would play with this toy. The vibrant colors, cute hanging toys, mirror, and music make this a Great item to have!  The keyboard rotates, so that as baby grows he can sit up and play with his hands, rather than just kick it with his feet. My two year old still tries to grab this out of the closet. It is easy to transport. Simply adorable! Recommended.",4
4513,"We love the multiple features of this and how baby can use this from birth- toddler years. Very easy assembly and very well made.",5
4514,"The concept here is great and the baby did enjoy laying under the colorful hanging toys but there is a need for some additional blanket or sheet to be used as cushion if being used on hardwood floors.  The piano keys are set off by a simple toe touch which worked out great and the entire time entertainment was provided.",5
4515,"As often with Fisher-Price products they don't disappoint. Very stable and was also easy to set up. Folds for easy storage and I can see little ones getting a lot of use out of this especially since it supports them so well.",4
4516,"At only 3-4 months old, my little guy loved sitting up. This is a great choice for young babies that have the head/neck control but aren't sitting unassisted yet. I only give it 4 stars & not 5 because he does tend to get bored, even with the attached ""toys"" (more like teethers). I've found we mostly use it when we're outside with my older son. Still, it was a good investment, though you likely won't get more than a few months out of this. I'd buy again.",4
4517,"Its a good product for that akward stage when a baby wants to constantly sit up but can't on their own. My daughter loved it. The only problem is i didnt use it long because my daughter out grew it pretty fast.",4
4518,"Got this for our 6 month old granddaughter. Set up is a little involved. I feel, it needed more back support and it is quite cumbersome for one person to get her in and out of the seat.",3
4519,"We bought this for our grandson.  He is only two months old now so he needs to grow into it some.  Loves sitting in it and will have lots more fun with it when he can play with the attachments.  Was delivered in good cognition and on time.  I would purchase this item again.",5
4520,"My son loves this chair he is 2 months old and holding his head up and needed something that was softer than a BUMBO and more like a swing cushion seat without all the thin straps.  This is lightweight and portable and just perfect!  I wish it was a little cheaper because it is kind of pricey.  If you think about it, you can buy a cheap high chair for this seat.  That is the only reason I didn't give it a five star rating.",4
4521,"it was easy to assemble and easy to clean.my baby had so much fun.i love it and she does, too.i recommend this.",5
4522,"like previous FP swings, this one is pretty easier to put together! Love that the are 16 'music' settings and that 2 are nature, for a more natural environmental setting (thought I think the cats liked those better than the baby!) Another plus is the ac adaptor, so you can leave it plugged in at home and save on batteries, but be able to take it apart and bring with you on vacation too! The adorable kitty and flowers make it perfect for the new little princess too!",5
4523,"This is the cutest baby swing ever! Complete with kitty cushion, this is a really cute and girly swing. Can swing from side to side, or head to toe. Gentle swing action, this swing comes with built in butterfly mobile, and mirror to keep baby entertained while swinging. Plays soft music, to lull them to sleep. This is so adorable and durable, 16 great nature songs, with six swing speeds. This is a sure win for every little one! From birth until 25 pounds, or baby tries to climb out. Machine washable.Legs fold for storage.",5
4524,"As a piece of nice-to-have equipment when babysitting, the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; is an good choice for Grandma&#8217;s house.  Unlike the Power Plus model of Fisher-Price&#8217;s Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing, this unit operates solely on batteries and its cost, on Amazon, is $34 lower.The unit, as with most Fisher-Price products, is made well and is nicely finished.  There are no rough edges on the plastic pieces; assembly is easy and quick.  The various swing speeds and the sound options are desirable features.The fabric seat cover is soft and removes for washing &#8211; always a necessity.  It is nicely padded and a three-point harness adds a safety factor.Although this Spacesaver unit is not quite as large as Fisher-Price&#8217;s standard cradle and swing models, it is not especially compact.  The footprint on regular cradle and swings is approximately 31&#8221; X 28&#8221;.  The footprint of the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; is approximately 31&#8221; X 17&#8221;.  The triangle design creates a stable base and is the reason the footprint can be smaller than other versions of the cradle and swing. The crossbar at the top of the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; made it somewhat awkward to lift our little one out of the cradle.  The difference in the height of the two units was not a significant factor in the decision with respect to the unit to purchase.While the Fisher-Price web site states the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; may be used until your little one &#8220;attempts to climb out of the product&#8221;.  I would not recommend using it once the infant becomes more physically active, let alone until they attempt to climb out of the swing.Further, although this is rated for infants who weigh up to 25 lbs., the unit does not work well for children over 20 lbs.  Battery life decreases with increasing weight and/or swing speeds; your actual experience will also vary depending on how extended the period of use is.  While you can plug in the Power Saver unit, I found this feature less than appealing.  It meant that the Cradle &#8216;N Swing had to be located near an outlet &#8211; and, that other individuals had to take care not to trip over the cord.Some individuals may prefer the muted, earth-tone colors of this Spacesaver model.  They will not stimulate your little one and will not clash with most d&eacute;cor.  I thought the color palette was not particularly fun or engaging for little ones.  The two animal figures on this unit are muted in color and are not easily distinguishable for infants whose ability to focus has not developed.  They cannot be removed.If you are looking for a nice cradle &#8216;n swing that is less costly than many of Fisher-Price&#8217;s models, you may want to consider their &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221;.",4
4525,"Supposedly, it plays music for up to 15min. Yet, after only 30 seconds the music stops. Don't know whether I got the one lemon or whether it is a faulty design. Unfortunately, I can not return it since my husband tossed the packaging. The only positive: it is really cute.",1
4526,"This is our second Summer video monitor and both have had different things wrong with them. Our old one from 2010 the camera was great, very clear but the audio always clicked. This new one is opposite. The audio is great but the camera sucks. The camera is not at all clear like our old one. We can see our daughter better in the day time vs the night. I thought about returning but for the price I'm pleased. If she was a newborn I would get a better one so I could see her more clearly. Do love the new volume controls and the smaller monitor size.",3
4527,"You guys, this is $10! For a cover and three inserts!!!I don't use the inserts as a stand alone prefold. I use them as an additional layer or I double them up and they're fine. But a bit bulky that way!They do leak if you only use one of the prefolds.This doesn't bother me because I purchased this set for the cover.So about that wonderful cover!!It's *simple*It's kinda like, if you like the old fashioned prefolds and pull on plastic pants and you like simple ways of doing things, this cover is for you! It's cute, it's thin, it's easy to put on, it fits well! It has no problems though it feels a bit flimsy. It doesn't bother me the way it feels and I have Rumparooz and Blueberry covers to compare it to!I LOVE Rumparooz and Blueberry covers, they're such  nice quality, but I don't feel sad when I reach for this out of my stash! I choose this one over my Bestbottom covers! I love this diaper. Knowing it's price and how not exciting it looks and seems it works fantastically!! I couldn't complain at all! It contains heavy pee and giant blowouts without a slight leak. It's cute when it's on. It's fun to see simple white or blue sticking out from my son's onesies... it looks like a diaper! I just really like it a whole lot and would (and will) buy more and love it a lot for exactly what it is!",5
4528,"Does what it is supposed to doHowever, would be nice if1.  It went longer than 20 min before auto shut off2.  You could plug it in (which in turn would make it easier to run longer)",3
4529,"this is one of the best purchases i've made. my only gripe is that i don't like the color/pattern, but as far as functionality it's great. also, you will not be able to or want to fold it into the pouch but that's okay. it fits the chicco perfectly and is easy to flip up and down. i started using it in the cold weather and now its summer and i still haven't taken it off yet. it protects in the cold, wind, from the sun, etc.",5
4530,"The elastic on the bottom of this cover fits well on our Graco SnugRide35. This cover stay on even on 40mph wind days. I am very satisfied.",5
4531,"these things are really great. we've had them a week or 2 and have used them basically every day... they're super easy to fill and clean - just rinse out and put in dishwasher! we've been putting 3 frozen puree ice cubes (i use the mumi and bubi trays to freeze whatever looks good at the farmers market) and a spoonful or 2 of baby cereal... when we go somewhere we bring them along, and it's been awesome. (we sometimes defrost ahead of time, or if we're going to be gone a while they defrost in the diaper bag or car) i love knowing exactly what she's getting, and not spending $1.50-$2 for the ready-made pouches every time! this is seriously one of my favorite baby items.",5
4532,"I make my own baby food so these are great for storing her food to bring along.  Easy to clean with a zip on the underside.  I can throw a couple of ice cube tray frozen foods into it and go!  Cute too!",5
4533,"I'm still indecisive on the hook and loop option verses snaps, but I love this cover. The print/pattern is beautiful and while this time it's for a boy, I wouldn't hesitate to use it on a girl. It is very comparable in size to the Bummis NB size, without a dip, but low enough I think we'll be okay (baby due in a week!). Comparing it to the other covers I've used over the last five years with other children as well as a size 1 Thirsties cover, I definitely see improvements to the type of velcro and the edging. I'm very satisfied with this and wouldn't hesitate to buy more from Thirsties.",5
4534,"These covers are great.  They are durable, and they look nice.  We have never had a single blow-out with these and our prefolds.  I'd recommend these to any parent.",5
4535,"These are the best covers to cover the old school cloth diapers. We have been using them for 1.5 years now. I recently ordered two more and while they preform great they seem much stiffer than the original ones we got 1.5 years ago (which are still going strong by the way). It's not just that the others are worn in, the Velcro strip is wider, rougher, and stiffer but still fantastic.",4
4536,"Great value on this set. We install it using the many included 3M doublesided tapes. They were easy to cut and fit. The cushion were very soft and ample :).",5
4537,"I have a marble step under my fireplace and this was perfect to protect my son from hurting himseld on the edge.  It's easy to cut with scissors so you can cover edges of different lengths.",5
4538,"I only used about 1/2 the double-stick tape I thought I'd need for this, and my Herculean son has gotten it loose in a couple of places.  However I am going to reinforce it with more tape, and I feel pretty sure that this will do the job for as long as we need it.",5
4539,"I feel like I expected more from this cover than I should have based on all the great reviews, but this diaper cover is insanely wide in the hips!! I cannot get a tight enough fit around the legs to prevent leaking, and the newborn I care for has some pretty chunky thighs! It's better with a bulky diaper like a fitted, but still not good enough for overnight use, which is when I use fitted. During the day I use origami-folded flats which are simply far too trim for this cover. The hips just flare out too much on this cover. I stopped using this cover since I get better leg coverage and less leaks from my Diaper Safari one-size covers using the newborn workaround and just use them instead.",1
4540,"So I've been using this for six weeks now and there are things I love about this and things that I'm not a fan of (but still plan on using it)Pros:- great sound and I like that you have volume control and a music option- The intercom is great (and nice and clear!)- The range is good too...I have somewhat of a larger house (2600 square footage) and it's two stories so I was worried about the range but no problems (even if I go outside!)- I like that you can purchase extra monitors if needed (up to four!)- You can adjust the picture depending on daytime/nighttime so you can see easier and it makes a huge difference!Cons:- So the company brags about a 24 hour battery life and NOT TRUE!  I'm lucky if I get a few hours out of it and believe me, there is nothing more annoying than the beeping from a dying battery at 4AM! (and yes, I do charge it)- The monitor is also supposed to be in color and sometimes is but there is no rhyme or reason for why it's color and why it's B&W; (and for the life of me, I can't figure it out on their website either but to be fair, I haven't tried to contact the company for assistance either).- At times the picture is blurry (with the night vision, the daytime is clear) like it's focusing on the wrong thing...not a major deal since you can still see fine but somewhat annoying.  Overall though, the picture quality is better than most at night!Overall I would recommend this to others and we have loved it!  The pros completely outweigh the cons so hopefully this review helps you make a decision :)",4
4541,"It's too hard to roll and turn. Plus, I'm not sure if they are swivel wheels or not. But I do like how it's adjustable height (just the seat is not the entire walker), and how baby can stand behind and push it.",2
4542,"I used this sleeper for several months instead of a bassinet or co-sleeper.  It worked out great and was easily transportable between rooms.  I loved that I could lay in bed and just reach over and gently rock my little one back to sleep when needed.  The fabric is super soft, and I love that it has mesh sides by the head so that your baby has good air flow which is SO important.The Ingenuity sleeper went together fairly easily and quickly, especially since I have the bouncy seat of the same brand.  Here are a few things that I loved particularly about this rocker/sleeper*It doesn't fold.  I love this aspect because I feel that it's safer than the folding ones.  I worried that it would collapse with the baby in it.  However, this may be a downside to someone who needs to be able to travel with this, or lives in a small space that needs to be able to store it when not using.*It's longer than some.  If you have longer babies, then you will probably be able to use the sleeper a little bit longer than with some other brands.*It has a soft rocking motion and all of the bells and whistles that you could possibly want.  Light, sound, vibration, rocking, cuddling.There were a few things that kept me from giving it 5 stars.  These aren't serious enough that I wouldn't get the same thing again, but wish they would consider for a re-design:*  I wish it was at a slight incline* While I like the mobile I find that it's often in the way so I ended up taking it off.  It doesn't slide on very easily so I've found that I just don't put it back on all of the time.",4
4543,"We have been using this sleeper with our newborn daughter, and it is definitely a high quality option.  We also use theFisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Vibrating Rock n' Play Sleeper, My Little Snugabunny, and here is a comparison of these two sleepers:- The Ingenuity is slightly longer than the Fisher-Price.  Therefore it will last your baby longer.- The Ingenuity has a stronger vibration feature.- The Ingenuity includes music and projection features.- The buckle on the Ingenuity is in the middle of the sleeper.  This isn't ideal when you aren't using the buckle, because it tends to bother the baby by hitting her side.  The buckle on the Fisher-Price is at the bottom.- The Ingenuity is more of a flatter surface, while the Fisher-Price is more of an incline.  The incline helps if your baby has acid reflux.- The Ingenuity has a head rest, which is nice.- The Ingenuity does not have a fold-up feature like the Fisher-Price does.  So it's ideal for keeping in one place, and not ideal for frequent travel.Both sleepers are great options. We'd probably pick the Fisher-Price since we travel with the sleeper, but overall I'd give a slight edge to the Ingenuity.",5
4544,"So I bought this for the arrival of my newborn son. I was super excited. in fact I still love the thing, it's adorable but not annoying like some baby items are. The colors are really subtle, everything is super soft, seriously the perfect sleeper to have in an adult bedroom. As soon as my son came home I noticed one big problem, the angle of the sleeper plus the fact that the back is soft made it so my son was sleeping with his chin against his chest- Which I'm sure a lot of moms know that is pretty dangerous for a newborn to sleep like that because it restricts their airways. In addition to that, the boy totally hates the thing.  It's very disappointing since everything else about it is so perfect. My son is on the smaller side (Almost 7 lbs) so maybe that's why, but I even tried propping him in the sleeper but that didn't work. My mother-in-law bought us the newborn rock 'n play sleeper by fisher price, it has a hard plastic back behind it, along with a different angle which fixes the breathing problem and he actually sleeps in it very peacefully. Sadly it's not as adorable as this one is, but I have to choose the safe more functional sleeper.",3
4545,"This unit is very similar to the FP My Little Snugabunny.  We have both.It is super soft minky material with mesh air panels beside baby's head for air circulation.  It does NOT have a hard molded back support (like the FP) so is more of a cradling effect.  Both are good!The legs of this unit are slightly curved so I can set this in front of me and use my foot to rock the sleeper while watching TV or reading a book.  The projector/toy mount easily detaches and swings out of the way.The only downfall is that it does not fold.  Yes, it's super light and easy to move, but from what I can tell you basically have to remove the legs to lay it flat for storage.  It's really hard to find the instructions to do this too... just something you have to figure out from assembly I guess.  This really is no matter to me, however, as I use it regularly and have no need for folding (yet).Recommend!",4
4546,"I find this rocking sleeper very convenient for naps and travel. The vibration feature is very soothing and puts baby to sleep. I love how easy it is to move from room to room especially when she is napping and I'm able to relocate it throughout the house with her in it without disturbing her. The light feature hasn't been discovered yet so I can't say that it is a remarkable feature. The bed itself is nicely padded and plush with a newborn headrest.  I have set this up both next to my bed at night and on the couch when I am taking power naps with her.",4
4547,"I ordered this for my sister, and she loves it. The design is cute, especially the projected stars and moon. The frame doesn't weigh much, making it easy to move from room to room. The one complaint I have is that I noticed the mobile with the 2 plush toys is kind of a poor design. It hangs from the light on top by a piece of ribbon. When bumped into, it flops everywhere, and doesn't spin traditional mobile. I was almost tempted to just remove it. Aside from that, the design is quite good.",4
4548,"My niece was just born 2 months ago and her parents have been using this rocker with her for the past month. She loves it. Sleeps well, appears comfortable, and it doesn't take up a ton of room. The music it plays is nice (soft) and the different vibrations seem to be soothing when she's upset. It's nice to look at, without loud, obnoxious colors which is nice too.I'll definitely be keeping this in mind for future baby shower gifts.",5
4549,"We gave this to our second born at 4 months when she started trying to fall asleep on her own. It was an instant hit and a big help. I didn't want to give her anything because of SIDS worries, but she was able to pull this off her face and the fabric is breathable so we decided it would be ok. She loves it. She can grab the blankie part and hold or suck on it as needed (and can find it in the dark as she flails about) and the ears and nose are great for chewing. We now have two, so that one can be washed. The thread for the eyes is already coming off on one of them, so that's not awesome, but it's not the end of the world--they are tiny little stitches, so it's not a hazard, just an aesthetic complaint. It's the only lovey I've found that I'm comfortable giving to a baby her age, and that kind of makes the minor issues not a big deal.",4
4550,"I have almost every aden and anais product for my baby. He loves the issies and I thought this would be a nice lovey for him too. I bought the elephant, dog, and giraffe. The elephant came with a huge defect, there were many long loose threads running all over the head, and sewn into it! The giraffe also had a few loose threads, including the eye coming loose.  The dog seemed fine, but after one washing, before I even gave it to baby, the one tack holding the ear down came off and left a hole.  The head is also coming loose and there are holes in the fabric.  I am very disappointed in these products. I asked Amazon for an exchange and will see if the new ones hold up.Edit: I received the new ones from amazon, but they also have issues. After just one wash, the embroidery is coming off on the elephant and the heads are coming loose. I don't want to give these to my baby for safety reasons and because they won't hold up, so I definitely don't want him to become attached to something that won't last long. Very disappointed.",1
4551,"I would have never thought I'd need something like this, but it is so useful! Was just using a cup before which is fine, but it's nice to have a handle when pouring. Plus it looks really cute!",5
4552,"It is very good, and much better than another one I bought. But the problem is that it is too cute, after one time use, it became my baby's toy, I didnot have any more chances to use.",5
4553,"This is perfect to rinse baby & it's shape does allow you to rinse head while keeping water away from eyes. Worth the purchase!",5
4554,"The whale design maatches the water spout cover we purchased for tub and LO seems to enjoy the new pieces as part of her bath ritual.",5
4555,"Super helpful when rinsing a baby/toddler! Works great & is very sturdy, yet not too rigid that its uncomfortable when rinsing off their head :)",5
4556,"This is such a great product. I love these:1. 2 zippers so you can get the milk from any side2. handle is detachable so you can easily hang it when you go out3. i can fit in 3 pcs 4 ox bottle in it4. I can add 4-8 squares of techni ice inside to maintain the coldness of the milk",5
4557,"I used it twice and it's already ripped a little on the inside. The liner is very thin. The white in the pattern also isn't really a white - it's more of a cream.",1
4558,"This wetbag is a great size and can hold several diapers.  It matches perfectly with my diaper bag. Perfect wet bag!",5
4559,"but it is bulky and takes up a lot of space, especially because it is and awkward shape. That being said it works well and I like it, but I never really use it. I just wash in hot, soapy water.",3
4560,"It serves it purpose but once you get to 8 ounce bottles instead of 4 the thing won't close as well. It's simple to use but I don't like how many times I have to fill it when cleaning Dr Brown bottles and parts. I have found it easier and quicker to use a pot of boiling water. I will be giving this to my in laws since they will be cleaning bottles less frequently than I.",3
4561,"With our new baby, and limited space for all the baby paraphernalia we need, I preferred to get a microwave sterilizer versus one of the steam appliances that would need counter space. I'm really happy with my choice. We have a standard size microwave, and this fits exactly (as in, it fits, but it is unable to spin freely inside on the turntable). It's very easy to use: easy to load items into it, easy to see how high to fill the water basin. I have not used this dishwasher insert because I have a separate bigger one I prefer to use, but the insert is very convenient for removing dry items to store in the cabinet before bagging them and taking them where I need them. The main reason I prefer this to a sterilizer bag (of which I do have a package of the Medela bags) is that if you stack the items properly, they can dry while in the sterilizer, but if you use a sterilizer bag, there's obviously no dry spot in the bag so you must unload it to allow items to dry. The way I use this box sterilizer is to wash items and load them, put it in the microwave, come back when it's done and pop the box on the counter and pop open the lid, leave the items to dry for awhile, and return to finish drying and packaging them for leaving the house. Very helpful!",5
4562,"With this brush you have to keep the attachment part connected, otherwise you won't be able to reach the bottom of your 8 ounce bottles.  Then you have to undo it to scrub your nipples.  It's annoying, but worth it for the level of cleaning that these bristles do.  The bristles do wear out quickly, though.",3
4563,"the bottle brush is soft and cleans well. the nipple brush is very useful as well to clean the nipples.",5
4564,"This carseat is easy to install and the fabric is great in the Laguna.  The only thing that really bugs me is the bottom part of the harness.The bottom straps ran across the top of my baby's thighs when I strapped him in.My LO is 9 months 18.5"", 19lbs. I drive a Lexus RX350. He really disliked the 'hugs' straps too but I know you can remove them.The velcro on the seat to keep the harness out of the way is terrible. You will snag your clothes and your babies!You also have to be careful when rear facing to make sure it is not too upright. My LO's head was falling forward when asleep.  Every time I made a turn his head rocked side to side. I noticed that I would need to install it again with maybe a rolled towel or pool noodle underneath.  That would solve the head slump.We ended up returning the Britax and buying the 2nd generation Chicco Nextfit. We love it!! It takes one minute to install and we love the fabric and the head wings. The fabric is similar to the Maxi Cosi Pria.  No need for a pool noodle, rolled towel or angle adjuster (diono radian rxt) when installing rear facing. The shoulder straps are now REMOVABLE with velcro. The seat is really deep which allows for extended rear facing with a long legged LO. I recently washed the cover and it turned out great. Wash in cold and hang dry. Watch a Chicco video online for directions on how to remove the cover. Baby loves the seat and sleeps great in it!I decided on the Chicco Nextfit after installing and trying:Recaro Preformance,  which was way too short in seat depth for a baby over the length of 29"". My LO's feet were touching the back seat at 9months.Maxi Cosi Pria,  has great seat depth and nice head wings. It is super stylish, but I was worried about safety. I wanted a steel frame. It was nearly impossible to get a tight install when rear facing.Diono Radian RXT, was hard to get a tight install in center of my car. It also takes up a lot of room without an angle adjuster. I don't want to worry about dragging an angle adjuster with me when traveling. I wanted to love it but I was underwhelmed. I cannot imagine putting a newborn in the seat.The ease of installing the Chicco Nextfit makes it a perfect seat to bring when traveling. No more sweating in the back seat trying to get a tight install!(We used the Orbit G2 infant seat before the Chicco Nextfit. I loved it!  It's heavy but the travel system is amazing. I could easily run errands without waking up the baby. It made getting out of the house so much easier!!! Super easy to clip the baby in the seat too!)",2
4565,"When we first bought this seat I almost gave up - the manual made it seem SOOO complicated!!  I'm an intelligent woman, but I couldn't figure out how to get it installed and adjusted.When I finally DID figure it out, I realized it's actually very easy.  Just know that there is a learning curve.  My son used to scream a lot in his carrier, so we switched out to this seat sort of early (he's 7 months old) and I'm glad we did.  He already seems much, much more comfortable.  He screams less and goes to sleep much faster.  And my husband & I both appreciate how much easier this seat is to adjust than the carrier was.  I miss having a base in each car, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.",5
4566,"I haven't even put a child in this seat yet and I already love it!First of all, I was dreading even opening the box because the Graco infant car seat and Alpha Omega car seat that I have used in the past were such a nightmare to put together.  I was extremely pleased to find that this seat was already fully assembled, which saved quite a bit of time and frustration.Second, this model easily fit rear-facing in my 2012 Cadillac SRX behind the driver's seat (and I have long legs).  When I used the Graco Snugride 35 for my first daughter, the passenger seat had to be moved uncomfortably close to the dash to accommodate her car seat.  My older daughter now uses the Alpha Omega Convertible car seat and it did not even come close to fitting rear-facing, even with the passenger seat all the way forward.Third, installation was super easy!  With the Graco and Alpha Omega, you basically had to have toddler-sized hands to use the latch clip, but the Britax latch is very easy to secure and the belts are easy to loosen and tighten.  Shoulder straps on this seat are also way, way easier to tighten than the other car seats I have used.I definitely recommend this seat and plan on buying another one for my older daughter so I can ditch the Alpha Omega!",5
4567,"So far so good, my daughter loves it! It took me over a month to finally choose this convertible carseat. I was torn between this one and chicco. I do travel a lot, so after reading many reviews I really wanted safety as a priority (and Britax was it). It was pretty easy to install, looks and feels comfortable!",5
4568,"We loved the predecessor seat (Boulevard CS-70) so much that we bought this seat for our second baby.  He's yet to use it, as he still fits in his infant carseat, but the pice was so good that we couldn't pass it up.",5
4569,"Every time I put my daughter in this, I wish I had a seat the looked so comfortable.  She would fuss and cry as soon as she sat in her old infant car seat.  She does not even flinch when I put her down in this.  It seems very comfortable.  My husband did complain about the complexity of installing it in the car.  The instructions are a bit complicated, but I think it is worth the trouble.  My baby falls asleep right away.  It keeps her high enough to look outside the window.  I feel very comfortable with her in it.  The straps are easy to put on.  One of the reasons I liked it more was that it is supposed to keep the straps to the side so I don't need to dig them out from under my baby, but it uses velcro and it doesn't really work well.  My baby just pulls the strap under her when I'm putting her in.  It is also easily adjustable as the baby grows - that is a major plus as we did not have that with the infant car seat (we would have to take out the car seat, flip it over, and adjust).  This allows you to adjust without having to take it out.",5
4570,"This carseat was very easy to install (much easier that the directions make it seem). It is way more secure and comfortable than the Graco infant seat I was using. The color and pattern are very pretty.  It fits nicely in my car and is very stable.  The latch hooks are really easy to install. I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Getting one for dad's car too.",5
4571,"We bought this for the safety first and ease of use second.  With all the feature like the safety cell base and true side impact protection it seems very safe; hopefully we will never find out.  It is assembled on the US and Britax has a very good worldwide reputation.  Installation is a little tedious but once it is in it is pretty solid.  The feature that we like best is the plastic insert that flips the buckle forward so its never stuck under your childs but, great idea!  The seat is pretty wide so if you install in the middle it will be squishy if others sit next to the seat on either side.  If you have time before you need to buy, keep an eye out for open box deals from Amazon.",5
4572,"The issue I have with these wraps is that they just are not convenient.  Unless you are using this for the first three months, before your baby starts to really move around and not want to sleep all the time, then this is kind of pointless.  I prefer these carriers to be more universal; more long lasting.  First, it takes ten minutes to get this thing on.  That&#8217;s a slight exaggeration, but slight is the key word.  Ten feet of fabric is excessive, if you ask me.  One of the worst aspects of this is that your child really has to face you at all times.  Outward facing, while doable, is not comfortable and not really as stable as I&#8217;d like it to be.  The child leans forward and the fabric stretches and it all feels so unsteady.  But, once your child is over six months, they don&#8217;t want to look at you.  They want to see the world.  So, ten minutes to strap this on, four hands to get your child in, all for about seven minutes before your kid starts to get irritated&#8230;it just doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me.Yes, this material is nicer than the Moby Wrap we already had, but it&#8217;s the same thing and neither one are good.",2
4573,"When I first received this, I thought it looked quite complex...I guess it is to a certain extent.  Some people don't have the best of coordination, but if you have some sense of your body, surroundings and spatial awareness, the illustrations become quite clear.  It actually becomes quite easy for you to use this all by yourself.  I'm not sure entirely how effective it is for all the stated age ranges, but for us, we're thinking anything under 2 years.  Your mileage may vary. :)",5
4574,"Let me start off by saying that I would never solely rely on this wrap alone. This wrap is great for doing chores around the house or breastfeeding in public when the baby is relatively small enough to conceal. However, the act of putting on this wrap is a bit of a chore. It doesn't take years to put on, but it would not be convenient if you running errands and kept having to place and remove the baby from a car seat for example.  I keep a normal buckle front carrier in the car just for that purpose.  There are tutorials on youtube which demonstrate how to use the wrap to wear your baby, which is helpful for us visual learners  The material this wrap is constructed of, is a bit more lightweight and breathable compared to the jersey which brands such as moby are constructed of. Another difference between this wrap and it's less expensive counterparts is the pocket placed over wear the baby sits. The pocket is fine for storing loose cash but anything other than that may affect the comfort of your baby in my opinion.  Overall, the wrap is comparable to the Moby Wrap minus the quality of the material it is constructed of which more breathable, durable, and remains taunt with the weight of the baby. I would recommend this product!",4
4575,"This &#34;ERGObaby Wrap, Clay&#34; is a cleverly designed wrap for carrying around a baby! While we were somewhat skeptical about the ability to put this on without a whole support team, it is actually quite easy once you get the hang of it. Here are our observations:+ Comfort; once this is on, it is great for both the adult and the infant+ Material; quit pleased with how soft and durable this is+ Ease of Use; with practice, it is manageable but not &#34;fast&#34; to put on or take offOverall, not sure I would buy it for our own use but this makes a great gift!Recommended!CFH",4
4576,"I really like this wrap. The material is nice and stretchy. I found it to be much nicer than similar wraps. I also felt it was cooler and easier to wrap than the Moby. The pocket adds a nice touch. My only complaint is it claims to hold up to 31 pounds. My son is almost 27 pounds and I didn't feel like it held him well. He seemed too heavy and I was worried he wasn't secure. I'll stick to buckle wraps for him, but I'm eager to use this with our little one arriving later this year.",4
4577,"Obviously the wraps are not for everyone, so if you'd rather have a quick carry solution, head for the carriers.  If you want that extra closeness with your baby, wraps are the way to go.  Both mothers and fathers can snuggle with their babies and hold them close as they grow.There are several different ways to wrap, including the one instructional included in the box.  I've included a link to any instructional video in my comments section.  The Ergo Baby Wrap is a soft and luxurious material that's quite comfortable.  What I especially like about the wraps is that they can be used for quite a long time.I had a carrier that baby James used and it was similar to the Ergo on one level because his parents were able to use it until he became a toddler. The closeness factor is really nice and I know whenever I used to swaddle my baby he tended to be less fussy.FEATURES:&#9658;  The Perfect Fit: The right amount of stretch makes it easy to tie right&#9658;  Long Lasting Support: Doesn't sag throughout the day from baby's weight&#9658;  Exceptional Comfort: Moves in every direction with you and your baby&#9658;  95% Cotton, 5% Spandex&#9658;  Machine washableYes, the Ergo Baby Wrap is pricey, but so worth it.  It's well-designed, has a high comfort level, and will last a couple of years.

4578,"The ERGObaby Wrap is a nice attractive wrap that holds the baby tight. I would compare it to the Baby Bjorn which holds the baby a lot looser and requires a larger child. There is big issue with wraps that sets it apart from the Baby Bjorn and that's putting it on. All these wraps are very complicated unlike the Bjorn. Also, my wife is very petite and had a lot of extra fabric. If you want the baby super snug the Ergo Wrap is pretty much like a swaddle but if you want to put a baby holder on quickly the Baby Bjorn is a lot easier.",5
4579,"Words from my wife:This is my first time using a wrap and was very pleased.  I've always been a little leery of the learning curve so have always shied away from wraps.  This wrap has worked great and I can see why so many parents and caregivers like them.  I can see this as being better for smaller infants.  I would be a bit afraid of it holding out for heavier kids.  My 3 month old fits perfectly at 15 lbs and I love how it keeps him so close.  I love how versatile it is with so many possible carry positions.  Overall a very nice wrap that I would recommend to any new parent.Words from me:It is an expensive piece of material (basically all it is is a long piece of cloth/fabric).  But it is easy to not have to worry about making your own, and material quality is good.  Buy it for the convenience factor vs cutting your own piece of material.  Also, the material is a bit stretchy so not sure if you could easily find something similar.",5
4580,"I am a big fan and user of theBaby K'tan Baby Carrierand was intrigued by another sort of wrap (having used no other.)  All in all, this one is certainly worthy of being considered for a wrap-style carrier, though I found it not quite as likable to me as my Baby K'tan (I prefer the adaptability of this one, a feature this wrap just didn't quite match.)That being said, this is wonderfully soft material and the eventual hold is very secure for your little one. I found it comfortable for short errands--I don't think I'd wear it too long for older babies. I love this particular palette of colors.  It's fairly easy to put on once one is past the learning curve.So, in the end, not too difficult to use and comfortable for both parent and baby.",4
4581,"I've had mixed feelings about my Moby wrap, because while I love the idea of a wrap and being able to use it in multiple ways, I find it confusing to use and the fabric is so thick that I always feel constrained and get overly hot when wearing it.While this wrap is comparable in most ways to the Moby, the difference is that the fabric is softer and less thick, so it is more comfortable to wear on a hot day, and it feels stretch ear and more giving. This is good if you are wearing a newborn and would like to be comfortable and allow the baby to wiggle or settle in and not be too constrained or uncomfortable. However, if you are wearing a 25 pound baby like I am, you will find that the baby tends to slowly sink lower and lower. Maybe I'm just not wrapping it tight enough. However, my baby cannot stand being in the Moby and immediately starts to cry because he feels too confined, while in this wrap, he stays put happily for about a half-hour, at which point he's usually sinking down and I am holding him up, so I take him out of my own volition.The pocket on the front is a really nice touch and makes it a lot easier to use than the Moby as you can see where the center is supposed to be. It's also great that I can put my cell phone and some Kleenex in there.Overall, I would recommend this over the Moby if you have a newborn, particularly if you live in a warm climate or have given birth in spring or summer. If you have a larger baby, I would recommend sticking with the normal ergo and not the wrap. The ergo is my go to carrier for most situations now that my little one is larger.",5
4582,"Got this for my Granddaughters new baby.They love it.It is soft, comfortable for you and the baby.You do not get a back ache from wearing this.This is big, and will fit a man also...This come with pictures that shows you how to wrap you and your baby. It does take a little practice, but it is worth the time.Once you get the hang of it, it is a piece of cake.I think this is more for the new born.I also got her the ERGO baby carrier, which is a bit heavier then this one , and is more for a older baby etc.Enjoy...",5
4583,"I thought that this was going to allow me to carry my baby in the Ergo Baby carrier. It doesn't. (Or, if it does, I still haven't figured out how.) I'm sure this is probably a great solution for people who are willing to spend the hours of research and years of yogic practice required to be able to meditatively warp this thing around yourself while your colicky two month old child screams, but for the rest of us, Ergo Baby carrier, or the Baby Bjorn (which I prefer) are probably better options. This, two hearts, beating as one hippy stuff probably doesn't have much merit. I'm sure the infant can hear your heart beat, even if there is a thin layer of cloth between the two of you.As my partner said, &#34;It's probably fine if you can make it past the initial trauma of opening it, finding out what you have to do, going and crying somewhere, and eventually figuring out how to use it...all while having a newborn scream at you.&#34;",3
4584,"We also own the Moby Wrap and our 8 month old likes both of these wraps but it does take a little getting used to in terms of wrapping it out in public. The instructions for the ERGO wrap does not say it can be used front facing which the Moby Wrap can do that. My wife did find that the material was stretchier than the Moby Wrap so it seemed like the baby sat lower. Overall this is a good wrap but my wife prefers the Moby Wrap.",4
4585,"We were really wanting this wrap for the baby, but were not sure it was worth the extra money. Because of the pocket it is about 20 dollars more than other baby wraps. But so far, in practicing, we have found it well worth the price. We watched a few YouTube videos on how to wrap the baby and have practiced a lot in anticipation of our new addition. If you are having troubles figuring out the fabric, watch a few videos and after a few practices it will feel easy.",5
4586,"Different baby carriers all have their place in this family. I am glad to see Ergo reaching out to do something other than a soft structured carrier. While SSCs are great, sometimes you just need a wrap (or a ring sling, ahem). This wrap is really long, so you've got plenty of fabric to work with even if you aren't on the small side. The fabric is stretchy, but doesn't get stretched out easily. It was plenty strong enough to hold my 20 lb. 11 month old. Wraps do have a higher learning curve than a SSC, but are worth it to learn.Reasons to wrap: Small baby. Easier for breastfeeding. Better in places where you'll be sitting and standing (or just sitting). More versatile than a SSC.",5
4587,"I was a bit apprehensive about ordering a tie wrap; I've only ever used pre-tied wrap and worried it would be difficult. I watched instructional videos on Youtube before trying it and after a few times I feel more comfortable tying it myself. The whole process from start to finish takes me about five minutes.I love the pocket in the front; it is so wonderful to not have to carry a purse in addition to the baby. It's big enough to hold my debit card, ID and phone. On hot summer days I want to carry as little as possible, so the pocket was a real treat. In addition, the material is very breathable. It doesn't leave me feeling sticky or sweaty or wishing I could take it off. It stays cool and comfortable, which is an absolute must for family outings in the summer.I'm very happy with this wrap! I would order it again in a heartbeat.",4
4588,"The good:This wrap shows great versatility. You can use it for front, side or back carrying and it&#8217;s good for newborns up to 31 pounds. You can even use it as a pregnancy wrap, which I tried (when I was very big at 36 weeks) to help ease the pain on your lower back.The wrap is machine washable, which adds to the convenience of using it, and the extra pocket in front is a nice touch. I got the eucalyptus color and it&#8217;s a very nice, soft, bluish green tint that is somewhat neutral.The other things of note:There is a lot of material for this wrap. A lot. I&#8217;m five feet tall and there is no way to put this on where both ends don&#8217;t drag the ground. That being said, it&#8217;s incredible that even though there is so much material, by the time you&#8217;ve wrapped it around yourself several times, the ends don&#8217;t drag down that low. In fact when I did the pregnancy wrap, I almost ran out of material and had to *really* pull to get everything tied.The bad:Although the wrap is rated for babies up to 31 pounds, the company website itself recommends you switch out to the carrier at 6 months because the carrier gives more structure and comfort. If that&#8217;s the case, why not just start with the carrier instead? At this price point, you really want something that will be used longer than 6 months.Also, despite having a TOG rating of 0.4, I am still hesitant to use this for my baby during the summer months, especially if we&#8217;re spending time outdoors. In order to get the right amount of support, you have to wrap your baby under three layers and there isn&#8217;t much ventilation holes. I know the material itself is supposed to be breathable but how breathable is it with three layers on baby?In summary, I think this is a good wrap for any season other than summer. It does have versatility and it&#8217;s easily cleaned. But in light of the advice from the company website to switch to the Ergobaby carrier at 6 months, I would consider just getting that one instead.",3
4589,"Ergobaby Wrap, ClayOut-of-the-box this is a beautiful wrap. The fabric is most excellent, being soft and incredibly flexible with quality stitching. Its color and styling are also very appealing;  I have the clay/black combination which is casual but modern, with a gentle ""washed"" appearance.I wanted to love this product and it's surely very desirable for those who have the patience and tenacity to endure the time and process of adjustment required to get comfortable and secure in it with baby. I watched several instructional videos online to prepare myself before I had even removed it from the box, which in itself seems ridiculous, but nevertheless necessary, as this thing is more challenging to put on than a ceremonial sari.My husband and I tried it out for the first time together-- we were both entertained and did some hearty laughing at the absurdity of the challenge. We are talking about wrangling 2.5 pounds of fabric (I weighed it with my kitchen scale) measuring in at 17 feet (I measured it with a sewing tape)! Unless you are The Jolly Green Giant, this length seems entirely extraneous. (I was also curious if this extra fabric is what shoots the price tag above comparable products.) Anyhow, even if one had the process down pat, one would have to put it on in a clean place, ie not in public, as it's impossible to avoid dragging the fabric all over the ground during ""application"".In the end, I found a video by Meg Collins whose method was easier, although she applied the wrap differently than Ergobaby instructs in their videos and pictorial instructions.I'm sure there are people willing to fuss with and perfect using this product. I feel there are similar products available which are much more user-friendly.",3
4590,"Babywearing is a HUGE interest of mine (I am a VBE of a local babywearing group), so I jumped at the chance to try out ERGObaby's new wrap.  I started my wrapping days with a stretchy wrap, and I've tried a wide variety of wraps with my three children.  Unlike other popular stretchy wraps, the ERGObaby wrap WILL work with a heavier baby, and even on your back.  More on that later.The ERGObaby comes in a few color choices, and includes a pocket.  As for most baby carrier ""pockets"" I've tried, you can't really stuff a bunch of things inside, or anything especially bulky or poky, but it's a nice little add on for small things.  It also helps you collapse the ERGObaby wrap when it's not being worn.  I really liked the color of the Eucalyptus and Pepper wraps and found them both a good gender neutral color.  Inside is an instruction manual with one type of front carry.  I appreciate that ERGObaby doesn't intimidate the newer babywearer that might pick one of these up with lots of instructions.  Their webpage has a few more instructions, and, like I mentioned above, unlike other popular stretchy wraps, since the ERGObaby wrap is a *hybrid*, it is safe for back carries*.  I personally liked the double hammock (DH) carry.I tried the wrap out with my 5 year old and my friend's 6 month old daughter.  It was okay with my daughter (she's very leggy even if she's not very heavy), but it definitely worked well for my friend's daughter.  The nice thing about the hybrid wrap is that it's stretchy without being too stretchy or saggy.  My friend, anxious to try out the wrap, used it on her 4 year old son in a DH and really enjoyed the way it wrapped.  She even borrowed the wrap and used it for hours with her youngest, and she said that even with a sloppy pocket wrap cross carry, it was comfortable the whole time.It is a bit more expensive than some other stretchy wraps, but it's worth every penny.  Most stretchy wraps sag too much when your baby gets bigger, but the ERGObaby wrap doesn't!  It's also cheaper than most woven wraps, and can do many of the carries that woven wraps offer.  It is definitely a great baby shower present!  I wish the wraps came in other colors and patterns, but it's a very small complaint for such a great carrier.  The other small complaint some might have is that the fabric isn't going to be especially breathable (though it's definitely better than some other carriers), though no multi-layer carrier is going to really be cool when you're wrapping it around yourself and a warm baby.  The other huge drawback for some is that wraps have a large learning curve and the amount of fabric can be intimidating to some, though it's usually an obstacle that can be overcome with practice.*Please be cautious when learning how to back wrap.  I personally recommend attending a local babywearing group if you can, but if you can't, there are great videos online to help teach you how to back wrap.  You might want to practice over a bed or a soft couch and/or with a spotter to help ensure your child's safety, or practice with a stuffed animal or pillow.  Unless an experienced wrapper, I would not recommend back wrapping with a newborn.",5
4591,"Though you get better at judging the wrap technique the more you do it, your baby also grows, and I've found it difficult to adjust a wrap.  Usually you have to unwrap, and rewrap tighter/looser, which is way more involved than the other types of carriers where you just adjust a strap.On the other hand this carrier is extremely comfortable, all soft fabric with nothing that's going to dig into your side or back or chafe.  You don't feel as stupid if you leave the carrier on while you drive between locations.  It seems to breathe well enough and cleans easily in the washer.",4
4592,"I am very pleased with the product.Admittedly, I was a bit nervous with using this wrap because I had a hard time picturing how it would support our little one since it is really a long piece of super stretchy and durable fabric with a pocket on the front. I did watch the video on the ERGObaby website which had a step by step guide that was super easy to follow. It was a bit clearer than the instruction manual and made me feel more secure with putting my little one in the wrap.I did practice a few times putting the wrap on before putting our little one in it. The first time, only because I am an overly cautious new mom, I did have my husband help me to make sure that I had the wrap on correctly before we put her in. She absolutely loves the wrap, even more than a typical carrier because she is so naturally able to curl up against my chest and sleep comfortably.You are limited to only wearing the wrap with the baby on your chest, but she enjoys it so much (as do I) that we are fine with that. There is a pocket that the wrap is supposed to fit back inside for easy storage, but it is a bit difficult to get the entire wrap back in securely. The wrap is easy to clean because it is machine washable. It washes and dries very nicely without showing wear on the fabric.It is a great product and I&#8217;m glad I gave it a try!",4
4593,"This is a rather nice wrap.  It's sturdy, soft, and has ample (maybe too much) length.  All in all, it's very good for what it is.  The challenge comes in just that, what it is.  Tying is can be a bit of a process, though the videos and practice help.  It just will never be as quick as other solutions that don't require tying or similar steps.  If you'll be carrying your little one for a while, this shouldn't be an issue, but for a short and quick uses, you may want to have another solution.The quality is top notch, as it has survived numerous washes and tons of use.  It's still doing a great job holding on, and I'm quite happy with it.",4
4594,"A wrap is basically a very long piece of fabric and you have to learn how to put it on properly. This took me a few tries to get it on and I ended up looking up on YouTube how to tie these properly. And even now, I am still getting used to it. Once you learn it well, I'm sure you will be able to put it on fairly quickly but this is something that takes a lot of practice.That being said, the fabric itself is very strong and stretchy and durable. it can fit any body shape and will be able to fit a large baby. There's also a pocket in front where I guess you can put stuff into but I never used it.My son was very comfortable in this and enjoyed being carried. A few cons for this really is the learning curve and also the price. I just find $80 for a piece of fabric a bit high, as nice as the fabric is. Still, it's better than a lot of other wraps I have seen. So if you enjoy wraps go for this but if you do not want to take the time to learn to use this, you may want to just get a regular backpack carrier.",4
4595,"I gave this baby wrap to a friend of mine, who has a new infant.  She liked it a lot, and said it was high quality.  I would expect as much for the price.  After only a couple of times, she found it easy to wrap the baby.  The material is breathable and won't make the parent or the baby sweat as much as other baby wraps.",5
4596,"I must admit, this took some practice, but with the help of some tutorial videos by the company on YouTube, it got easy to wrap this soft material around the body,  It's very comfortable material and having baby wrapped closely is soothing.  Like others have noted, this is a long wrap that looks gigantic on smaller people; perhaps less so on larger ones.  It's soft and washable.The downside is the time it takes to wrap baby close to you.  Once wrapped in, baby is safe until diaper change time.  This is a nice thing to have around the house.",4
4597,"The fabric is amazing quality. And the pocket is a great extra feature in comparison to some of the other wraps. If you have the time and patience then I'm sure you will love this wrap.",3
4598,"I thought maybe I could like the wrap, but it is clearly not for me.  I know people who love using them--but I just can't.  There is just so much material over 10 ft)--and unless you are wearing it with a sleeping infant for a long time around the house or one a walk, I just don't see how it could be convenient to use.  The material of this ERGObaby wrap is great-well made and soft and with a great stretch. I also like the pocket and the contrasting color in front (mostly so I know I put it on right:)).  It does take a little time to learn how to put it on )(you-tube videos are great), and I feel like I am still a little slow.  Once on correct, my baby did feel secure and I did not feel like he was unsafe at all.  It can be used up to 31 lbs but I have a hard time seeing that size of  child content in there for too long, and after all that work to put on it would be hard to want to take them out so soon.",3
4599,"Recommend that you practice this at home with baby (or pillow if baby isn't here yet) before you even consider going out on errands.  Recommend that you put it on before and wear it while driving and then add baby upon arrival.  That way you don't have to fuss with hooking yourself up while you and baby are ready to shop!Claims that you can wrap front, hip, back and even pregnancy support.  Great quality stretchy fabric.  (you'll need an extra pair of hands for the back wrap)  Love that you can keep baby tucked in while at home doing chores (just hold her head when you kneel down-lean forward)  I like the front position - and like the flexibility (stretch), yet it feels very supporting.The fabric is warm:  add your body heat and baby's... great for cooler weather.  Everyone's different though...it may be fine for you in warmer weather.",4
4600,"When my baby was first born I used a Moby wrap. The problems I had with it were creating a pocket for the baby, and wrapping it just the perfect amount of tension to hold the baby in. I felt like every time I wrapped it, it was different. Then over time the wrap would sag and sometimes it felt like she might come right out of it. I was thrilled when I got the ERGObaby to try as I was looking for a better way to wrap her.The ERGObaby is a lighter and more stretchy material, it is also a bit longer than the Moby wrap. I love that you don't need to make pockets with this wrap! You simply wrap it as tightly as you can every time and it is a reliable predictable wrap. It holds its shape the entire time I wear it and she sits in it the same way every time without me having to adjust it and rewrap it. The material is really wearable, isn't hot at all, and washes well. The pocket is wonderful. I throw sunscreen in there at the park for my toddler, or a small wallet at the grocery store.This wrap works better than the alternative for me. I am happily wearing my ERGObaby wrap while my Moby collects dust.",5
4601,"I really love this wrap, I only wish I had it when my toddler was a newbie. It's a great beginner wrap (watch the videos), super comfy, and doesn't feel too hot in the FL weather.  For those with mobile children (who always want to be put down as soon as you wrap them), I prefer my Boba carrier or a ring sling.",4
4602,"I love, Love, LOVE wraps!  I've had a Moby before, but never anything else.  This wrap is FABULOUS and definitely ranks as a favorite.The first thing most people ask about wrapping - how do you do it?  YOUTUBE!  There are so many helpful videos to teach you all kinds of wraps to make wearing your baby as comfortable as possible.  I have a short torso, and my back isn't in the best shape.  For me, the best carries are the simplest - criss-cross over my back to distribute the weight.  Ask other moms who baby-wear what carries work best for them and have them demonstrate.  Some areas even have baby-wearing groups you can join to learn and experiment together!The second thing I get asked most - isn't it time-consuming?  When I first started wearing my babies, yes, it was.  I would get to the commissary and pull the wrap out of the trunk and stand there in the parking lot trying to wrap myself up before the baby cried. I figured out that if I did it home, while baby was still playing or whatever else before we left, it wasn't bad at all.  Also, the more I used it, the less time it took me to get tied just the way I liked.  Practice makes perfect and before long, it didn't take but a few seconds more to wrap the baby than to use a soft-structured buckle carrier.Third - isn't it hot?  Some materials breathe better than others, for sure.  This material was pretty good on that scale.  You ARE wearing another tiny human close to you, so it's going to be warm.  The Ergo wrap wasn't any hotter than the Moby and I just used it cruising around the park with the heat index of 105.  Wear a tank top or lightweight shirt, and dress baby appropriately, and you'll be fine.Overall, I love this wrap.  It offers versatility in that you can wrap and tie it a multitude of ways, and the size is always just right for you and baby.  It's easy to clean - it's machine washable even in my apartment-sized machine.  The contrasting fabric swatch makes it easy to find the middle when you're wrapping, and the bonus is that it's a pocket!  Just remember not to put anything in there that might poke baby!  The spandex gives it a little more durability, I think, too.  The Moby definitely stretched out over a few short months with a newborn, and I can see this wrap keeping it's tension a lot longer because of the composition and quality of the material.  It's rated for up to 31 pounds, so you can get quite a bit of time out of it, too!  This is a great addition to our collection of every day use items for baby and youngsters!",5
4603,"I have used a more structured baby carrier in the past and it's worked very well, but has been difficult to use right after a c-section and was often more than I needed.  This was a great solution, it works well with tiny infants and doesn't put as much pressure on a c-section incision.  It is also great for us to use without having to constantly adapt straps between my husband and myself, who are two very different size people.  It is however pretty confusing to put on and took me several times before I could put it on without looking at the instructions.",4
4604,"This is so great When I have my grandbaby with me I can get allot more done with this than I ever did wish I had this when my kids were growing up",5
4605,"This baby carrier is easy to put on and my baby feels secure and comfortable in it. It cleans easily washed on the gentle cycle with cold water and like dry. The color is universal and coordinates with my clothes very nicely.",4
4606,"This is a very nice stretchable Ergo Baby wrap. It wraps around my girl and body very well as I can adjust the contours and positioning according to how I like it.However, the only disadvantage to this is that I have to tie it every time I use it. While it is fairly easy to tie, it is quite a hassle when we want to get things done faster with a squirmy baby...",4
4607,"It's a really long cloth. Way more than one needs.It takes 12 steps just to put it on you.It takes 7 more steps to put baby in it.Good Grief.I'm sorry, this is ridiculous. I can easily design something that is assembled with minor adjustments and way less cloth.I can't imagine ever using this (nor can my wife).You should really look at videos or instructions and make sure you want this before getting it.",1
4608,"Of all the bibs out there&#8230;cloth, vinyl, plastic etc., this is the one to buy!Love the colors it comes in.Soft upper fabric with no stiff vinyl around baby&#8217;s neck or chest.Easy Velcro closure.Can be wiped down for next use or washes in a snap (I don&#8217;t put mine in the washing machine as it is so easy to wash up by hand.)Handy little catch all for those treasured cheerios, peas, corn, bits of fruit, meat, snacks.Our little one often checks his treasure trove!Lightweight.The spoon is a plus and the bib and spoon can be wrapped up together for on the go days.",5
4609,"This is the second OXO bib I have gotten to use on my grandson. The only problem with the first one was that the hook and loop closure became less effective with age. But it it is still working well enough after about a year of near daily use.  We use the bibs at meal times of course but we also use them while shopping. My 17 month old grandson sits in the shopping cart seat wearing his bib into which snacks have been placed. He cruises along munching away.  This keeps him happy long enough to get the groceries bought and paid for.  We have really enjoyed these bibs!",5
4610,"My go-to bib in the past has been the Baby Bjorn plastic bib, so I'm comparing this product with what has been my favorite bib up until this point.For home use, I'd still prefer the Baby Bjorn because having a bib fully made of the harder plastic is easy to clean, easy to keep on (with a snap vs. a velcro closure), and makes it easy to catch food.But I think this is a good alternative for travel.  It basically replaces the hard plastic in the upper half of the bib with a soft, foldable material and a velcro closure.  This means that you can roll it up (with the spoon inside the bib if you want) which makes it much more portable.  You get the benefit of the harder plastic shelf to catch food with greater portability.The spoon is on the longer side for baby spoons and has a thicker handle, which is convenient when adults are feeding the baby. I'll have to wait a while to see how it works for a child feeding his/herself.I expect to use this on the road and also think it would be a nice gift set for an expecting parent.",4
4611,"This is a great product. The colors it comes in are super fun. My niece loves the green color and wants to steal it from her baby brother, LOL. The bib is comfy for baby, and the little tray works pretty well (though of course, any tot will still find a way to get at least some food on the floor). Overall, it's a great bib/spoon set.",5
4612,"I rented a double Citi Mini Jogger at a theme park about a year ago.  I enjoyed it then, but had no idea how convenient and easy to use the single Citi Mini stroller would be.  This stroller is hands down the easiest stroller I have owned to fold and lift into my car.  It is truly a one hand lift and the lightweight body makes it possible to do with a toddler on your hip.  The compact width of this stroller makes it a breeze to push through the city streets and doorways in compact boutiques.  It rolls easily on the sidewalk and through light gravel at the park.  I also love the large shade to keep my little one protected from the sun.  I can easily push it with one hand while jogging on a paved path.  The storage basket is smaller than my other jogging stroller but this is an easy trade off compared to the overall functionality and ease of folding and lifting.  I have replaced two strollers in my trunk with just this Citi Mini Single.  I absolutely  love it!!!!",5
4613,"First off, we have been a Britax family from the start, so I will base my review from that stand point. I understand, the B-Agile is more aligned with the City Mini, but they are still the same form factor.The Baby Jogger makes an excellent looking and solid feeling stroller, this stroller has handled most terrain of our daily stroll which consists of sidewalks and some dirt. This stroller works great if you have a smaller car trunk as it folds in very compact. The seats is reclinable to almost fully flat, but at the most upright position, the seat still has a good recline. Here's my breakdown:Positives:1. Height adjustable handlebar, much more comfortable for me at a higher level.2. Front wheel suspension adds an extra comfort during larger bumps.3. Brake system (also see negatives) it is nice having the parking brakes at a hands reach, it is very secure as well, the release requires you to pull on a latch, all can be done with one hand.4. More seat padding!5. Large hood has 2 viewing windows on the top.6. Reclining the seat seem easier to do.Negatives:1. Slightly heavier than the B-Agile2. Brake system can be a burden to use when you hands are full.3. You can't use the handlebar for hanging items, i.e. grocery or a stroller organizer!4. When folding the stroller, the lock doesn't activate automatically the nylon material always gets in between the lock and latch. The design on the B-Agile is better.5. When folding the stroller and the handlebar is tilted down, stroller will not fold completely as it will hit the front wheel and probably smash your fingers too (something to keep in mind).Not as much as storage area or options with the GT.As most of you already know, or will learn soon enough, purchasing a higher end stroller they never include any accessories, so you will to spend money to get a cup holder for the baby or yourself.Overall, this is still a great stroller, if we had not purchased a Britax carseat and stroller when the baby was born, this would have been the stroller I purchased, its a solid performer!",4
4614,"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my Baby Jogger City Mini GT!  I researched for months before purchasing, and so glad this is the one I chose.  I have no intention of jogging, but do tons of walking.  It is so light and pretty compact.  It is a dream to steer!  Baby is very comfortable. I am glad I got the new model even thought the price difference was huge.  I think the improvement in the adjustable straps was worth the cost.  Now to buy some accessories.  If you are looking for a light weight jogger, this is the one you want!",5
4615,"We have a regular 2011 City Mini for when our daughter was born.  We went to the Big Box Stores and tried all of the brands and fell in love with the City Mini mainly for the compact size and super-easy folding.  Years ago, my wife had been with her sister-in-law at the mall and their extremely expensive Bug-a-Boo stroller was so heavy and super complicated to fold, it took two of them to get it in the car.  In the years following, we have convinced many a parent to get a City Mini.Now enter the City Mini GT - GT for the never-flat all-terrain wheels that's a dream to use when you're not on smooth ground.  The never-flat wheels are awesome because we also have a B.O.B. Stroller Stride with the big-wheels for jogging and we have to bring a hand-pump to air up the tires ever so often, what a pain!I give the *GT* 4-stars because in comparison to the regular City Mini, my wife still prefers the Regular, non-GT and we would give that a &#34;5&#34;.  So why 4-stars for the City Mini GT?1. We feel the regular City Mini is easier to maneuver with one-hand; the regular has technically two small wheels that pivot and seem to maneuver slightly easier.2. The City Mini GT does have an adjustable handle bar angle, but we feel it somewhat makes it easier to tip back for some reason; we are more confident in our regular City Mini and perhaps it is because it is slightly heavier or perhaps the wheelbase might be slightly enlongated that it feels more sturdy.3. After using our B.O.B. with the big wheels, we would NOT feel comfortable jogging with the City Mini GT, perhaps the B.O.B. has more suspension all around and perhaps it is the bigger wheels, but if you don't jog with the GT - then you might as well just get a regular City Mini.  Yes, the GT does offer a locking front wheel, but there's no comparison with the B.O.B. Stroller Stride line for jogging.Overall, the wheels on the GT make it slightly more bulkier and doesn't fold as flat as the regular City Mini.  So if you had to choose one stroller, we would personally choose only the regular City Mini, since the GT doesn't give us extra features/benefits that we would use over the Regular.  Still, one-handed folding and an improved &#34;brake&#34; make the City Mini GT a great 4-star stroller.  P.S. I would give the B.O.B. Stroller Stride a 3 for overall use since it is pricey, extremely, extremely heavy, the tires need airing up ever so often, and the ONLY reason we have it is for jogging, we would not want to use the B.O.B. everyday.",4
4616,"When I received the Baby Jogger through the Amazon Vine reviewer program, I was aware that I will be receiving a product that has been very well received by the customers. I was however not completely sure if I'll love it as much as I love my Britax B-Ready.The product arrived and we could assemble it in a matter of minutes. My then 15 month old son liked it so much, that he wanted to climb it immediately. Once we settled him in the stroller, he refused to climb down.We've taken our son out and about in this stroller to cities big and small and for strolls in the neighborhood. I absolutely love it light weight, ow easily it can be folded/unfolded and the convenience it brings in resting it against a wall in tight spaces.In terms of maneuverability and quality of the fabric and metal and ease of use, I'm quite impressed. So much that I sometimes prefer it over my Britax B-Ready.The only limitation I see in the stroller is that for a sleeping baby, I can adjust the foot rest, like I can with my other stroller. This feature could make it even more convenient for taking a baby around.",5
4617,"My daughter is six weeks old and this has been great!  Very easy to open and close and very smooth ride.  My only complaint is that I wish the bottom bucket was bigger...it doesn't fit much so I have to carry my diaper bag (other strollers have larger baskets or at least you can hang your bag from the handle) but all in all very happy with the purchase!",5
4618,"I've only tested this a short time. It's very sturdy, and more importantly, stable. It's easy to maneuver around and is built with quality. I wish it was lighter, but you can't have both. I like the expandability of it, hoping we can get more use out of it as the family grows.",4
4619,"I was really excited about this stroller, and it has some great features. Its very smooth to push, looks great, has great storage features....but i have had so much trouble adjusting it, its not working for us. Im giving it a few more weeks and I'll adjust my rating if my opinion changes.",3
4620,"I've bought a ton of 3 sprouts storage containers over the last year. This toy chest is the latest addition, and it is perfect. Initially, I was worried that it may be flimsy and collapse if my son tried to reach into it, but it is actually pretty well-enforced. We haven't had any problems, and it is slap full. The cheetah is one of my favorite 3 sprout animals.",5
4621,"His favorite teether!  Much less expensive than the popular Sophie Giraffe, and he actually prefers it to the Sophie we got as a gift!",5
4622,"I like that these are in fact reusable.  I've packed many a sandwich and snack for my daughters.  We have both the owl and ladybug sets.  My girls love the handle on the smaller pack, makes it easy for them to carry around.  The sandwich bag is much larger than I anticipated! It could easily fit two sandwiches and have room for more (if packing for a group or you are really hungry :)I did read another review before purchasing and it stated if the food was left in the bag to long it takes on a plastic flavor.  I have to agree with this review.  We recently forgot about puffcorn in the pack and discovered the next day.  It wasn't stale but did have a differ flavor.  Just keep in mind to empty bags before to long and it shouldn't be a problem!",4
4623,"I and my daughter love these bags.  They are easy to clean and dry.  Very handy for almost any kind of food and very cute.",5
4624,"This is a very good video baby monitor that I would recommend to friends.Here's what I love about this monitor:-It's so quiet!  There is no static at all!  The only noise I hear is my child.  Just what I want.-Receiver has a carrying clip that also functions as a stand.-Both camera and receiver are lightweight-Receiver doesn't need to be plugged in, once charged.-Camera base has very good grip!  This will not easily slide off a shelf.  It also comes with mounting screws.-Very good pivoting head on the camera-You can turn off the viewing screen and still listen for your baby.-You can speak into the receiver and the camera part plays your voice.  Importantly, this function only works when you hold down a button, like a walkie-talkie.  Your voice will come through crisp and clear.  I used this to communicate with my older daughter when she was sick in bed.  I don't know how often I'll use it with a baby, but it is very convenient.There are just a couple of things that could use improvement:-The screen is smaller than I expected.-When the night light function is on, there are two orange lights, one on each side of the camera, then one red light below the camera.  In a dark room, it kind of looks like a scary face! We don't need any extra reason for nightmares!If the screen were a little larger, I'd recommend this 100%.  As it is, I'd say the benefits still out-weigh the drawbacks.  I'm happy with the monitor.",4
4625,"Meets your basic needs but is missing some of the real helpful features like Zoom and VOX. I would recommend theInfant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Visioninstead; it has a larger screen, VOX, and is less $.The screen is ultra-small which makes it very difficult to see if you baby is awake or not.The screenshot they show in the product images is 100% fake/simulated You will not get anything close to that quality; very misleading by Lorex.The antenna also came loose after a few uses. It no longer snaps back into place.",3
4626,"Overall, I was very unimpressed with this monitor. The picture quality is only decent. Even in full light, you should not expect anything even remotely as clear as what you see on the product page. Whatever these photos were taken with, it was not the camera that comes with this monitor. The sound from the camera to the monitor is also decent. The ""talk to baby"" feature is pointless. The voice comes out as echoed and loud. It's like taking to you baby over the grocery store loudspeaker. This is not comforting and this feature is pointless. (In fairness, I've not found a baby monitor that performs this function well.There are a couple of things I really like about this monitor. I appreciate that the cord for the base unit and the camera are interchangeable. I also find the belt clip feature quite clever. The stand for the monitor twists around and becomes a belt clip. Very clever.At the time of this review, this monitor stands around the $100 price point. This monitor just isn't worth it. If you want something at this point, I suggest theLevana Sophia. It has the same basic features and costs a little less, but has a better picture and a bigger screen.",3
4627,"Over the years we have used several different baby monitors. For whatever reason a baby monitor seems to have a relatively short life before it fizzles out...so far (regardless of the brand) we have averaged between 9 and 15 months before we have had to replace all of our monitors.... on of which included a previous generation of this lorex monitor.Notes- We really like our previous Lorex video monitor... and while we have a found a few new ones that we like more - we still have a good impression of the Lorex brand.- Screen Size - Very small.... I mean very, very small maybe the smallest that I have ever seen on a baby monitor. I am not sure how much it matters, because as the screen gets larger you generally lose clarity. Unfortunately, the Lorex BB1811 isn't overly clear even with the smaller screen.- Low light performance - I'll let you in on a secret - all baby monitors stink in low light/dark. Yes, they are good enough so that you can see that your child is jumping on the bed in the dark, but don't expect anything other than a very grainy picture. The truth is that is one of the things that separates all video cameras (not just baby monitors). High end (read expensive) offer a much better low light picture.... cheaper cameras are always grainy.- Two way talk - again, this available on many monitors - which is a good thing...since this is a critical feature- Wireless range - I haven't tested the full 450ft, but in the case of most these monitors (including my previous Lorex) assume that the maximum range is strictly for absolutely ideal conditions.- No built in lullabies... oh well, despite having this on a couple other baby monitors we never used it.- Expandable up to 4 cameras...again a relatively basic feature.- Not wifi enabled- if this is important to you expect to pay more than this price point.Final Verdict - The Lorex BB1811 is certainly an acceptable product, but it really isn't outstanding in one area. Our preference is the Samsung SEW-3036WN which costs more, and has a few flaws (at times it interferes with out wi-fi signal) but as a whole it seems to be a better value.3 1/2 Stars",4
4628,"Why is this not interference-free for most households who use WIFI?LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY:========================Every wireless video baby monitor I've researched runs at 2.4ghz. They may not put that in the description, but when I track down the manufacturer specs, it states 2.4ghz. Your wireless Internet/WIFI also transmit at 2.4ghz. Even the newest 802.11g and 802.11n transmit at 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz. My smartphone's WIFI as well as my wife's Netbook only works at 2.4ghz, not 5.0ghz. My Internet router also works at 2.4ghz and is not dual band.WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?========================After our baby, when I returned to work, I noticed strange lockup issues on my phone and horrible call quality for VOIP. I thought the Internet seemed slower and pages would sometimes lockup. After a lot of searching, I stumbled upon someone mentioning interference from their baby monitor, ding, ding, ding! Sure enough, I unplugged the video baby monitor and ran an Internet speed test, and I was getting 95-100% of my throughput rate. I plugged in the video monitor and the throughput rate plunged to 10-40%! I unplugged again, and wah-lah, back to 95-100% again! It was quite clear that the 2.4ghz that these video baby monitors transmit on, also affect/&#34;interfere&#34; with WIFI devices that transmit at the same 2.4ghz.This Lorex Wireless Baby Monitor is no exception, it transmits at 2.4ghz.  Please test your own 2.4ghz wireless monitors the same way, night and day difference.That being said, I feel 2-stars is fair.  If you don't even know what VOIP is and don't work-from-home and use the Internet casually, then this video baby monitor is reasonable, but actually a poorer picture clarity than others I've used.Other models for comparison:========================We have used the wireless Summer Infant, Motorola, Levana, and Infant Optics video monitors.  The Summer, Motorola, Levana Stella are more than twice the price, but they have large 4-5&#34; screens, excellent picture clarity, and the ability to pan/tilt/move the camera remotely.  The ability to move the camera makes it worth the extra price.  If you are first-time expecting parents, you won't realize the value of that until your little one arrives and they start rolling around and flipping over, etc.&#34;Wait, I work-from-home, I use VOIP/online meetings with our WIFI/Internet, any solutions for us?&#34;===========================================================================Yes!  For ~$60 for a Foscam 8918 **IP-BASED** wireless camera, you can have a true *Interference-Free* video baby monitor that you can pan/tilt/move from the convenience of your phone!  Yes, that's right, even in complete darkness, the ~$60 Foscam IP-Based wireless camera allows you to monitor baby from any smartphone connected to your house WIFI.  It's interference-free because it follows the IP protocol standards.  Yes, it's significantly harder to set-up, but if you know what VOIP is, I'm sure you can figure it out.  Foscam is just 1 brand, there are several *IP-BASED* brand wireless-network cameras out there; Foscam just happens to be the brand I chose.Overall, for all of the reasons above and knowing all of the less-expensive alternative options out there (IP-BASED wireless cameras that pan/tilt/move remotely), 2-stars is fair here.",2
4629,"I have three video baby monitors. The other two (Motorola, Belkin) are designed to be viewed via an app. The other monitors suffer from fatal problems, for example, if the camera loses power, it forgets its wifi connection, and the app doesn't keep the password and logs out all the time. Also, I don't like the idea of my video being hackable via the internet. The only advantage of the online monitors is that you can see the video when you are not home, i.e., nanny-cam.This Lorex BB1811 Wireless Baby Monitor is a simpler, non-internet technology. It just works. Also, it has a 2-way talk, which is useful, though poor audio quality. Also, the range is not huge -- don't expect the same range as some cordless phones or your wifi.",4
4630,"Before our baby girl was born we used a gift certificate to get a Lorex LW2004 Video Baby Monitor with 2.4-inch LCD and Automatic Night Vision. After she arrived we started using it, and realized it had some pretty big limitations. The monitor was &#34;portable&#34; but the battery only lasted a couple of hours, then took another 12 to recharge. The night vision was finicky and the screen itself flickered on and off. It worked... but was so frustrating it was sometimes easier to do without. And indeed we did, throwing it in a box, a box that got put in the garage. I definitely wouldn't spend money on a Lorex after that.We were given a Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom 32111 (White), which was significantly better. We've been using it for a year and a half now, generally pleased. It is feature rich and works consistently. We bring it with us when we travel.With another one on the way in August, I wanted to see if it was worth trying a different brand rather than getting an extra camera. I was suspicious with this Lorex at first, but a review product is a review product, so I was willing to take a risk and happy to provide a harsh review based on what I found and with the emotions of wasting money on our first one.Since first using this, I have to admit that the Levana Jena has been put away and the Lorex has taken its place. I was reluctant to like it, and initially didn't because it seemed much more basic for about the same cost. But we use it precisely because it is more basic and does the basics easier and better.First of all, the image seems sharper and more clear, especially during the day. The night vision is also a step better (radically better than the first Lorex we had). This doesn't have the added music or thermometer or such that our Jena has, but that's fine. We don't end up using those anyhow. The thermometer was very useful when we were living in a place that lacked central heating and cooling, but now we can control the temperature of the house at once.What I like about the Lorex is that it is straightforward. One button on the monitor turns the video on and off, leaving the option for just sound only very easily accessible. Hold down another button and the orange &#34;nightlights&#34; go on and off. One of my first critiques was that like so many baby monitors, there's a lot of light coming from the camera (a silly feature in my mind). But when I saw how easy it was to turn the lights on and off, I like it as a feature and an option (not as a requirement).The sound is clear as is the microphone to speak into the room through a speaker in the camera.This isn't the fanciest video monitor, but it's good at what it offers, is simple to use with the features that we find we use the most, and is generally well-designed. Very pleased.",5
4631,"I was very impressed with this product, especially given the features it has in such a compact package. I have used it to monitor both baby and pets. The image is clear, and, the audio is very clear (no static at all). It is super convenient to be able to use the belt clip to hold the wireless monitor as I go about my household chores. I also trust Lorex, having used their products in the past. I do wish the battery life was a little bit longer, as the only inconvenience I have experienced is the recharging of the unit (best done at night when the monitor is in a stationary position anyway). Its just that my days tend to be longer than 7 hours (!). Other than that, I think the price for this unit is very reasonable and would highly recommend it to other parents and pet-owners alike.",5
4632,"I am pleased with this seat as it was labeled. It's a good basic seat. I bought for the price and safety rating. It does have the latch clip but you do have the pull on the teether to get it tight so in that respect I actually like my Evenflo seat better.",4
4633,"We have 2 other Britax seats. Although I like the Marathon more because the back is shorter, this one does the job and is thinner (by a hair). The only issue is that when it is backward facing AND you are using a mirror, you can't see the mirror very well because the seat is taller than the average seat. Which is strange becuase we have a Marathon 70. Anyway, for the price of this Britax, it's a good buy.",4
4634,"This is a good value for the money. I would recommend buying one size larger thank you would get normally, they shrink a bit when you wash them and can get tight around the leg.  I bought another pair.",5
4635,"Easy to get on and off. Worked well carrying my 18lb baby through BDL, ATL, and PBI. Now she's 25lbs and I still use it when I shop. She seems comfy and always falls alseep in it.Gorgeous pattern. Easy to wash. Would be great if it packed up small and into a little pouch.",5
4636,"The material this car seat is made of is very good. My son spilled milk on it twice and the milk slides off onto the side not ever leaving a wet mark nor stains.  I drive a 2008 dodge charger and its a perfect fit, just in case anyone is wondering if it will fit in there backseat. If i ever have another baby, i will order this brand again. Great item. I am very happy with my selection.",5

4638,"This thing seems to be made out of foam, with snaps to hold it together.  It's pretty cheap, but I have two boys who have been playing with it and using it now for 5-6 months, and they haven't ripped or broken it yet.  This thing makes bathtime and hair washing much less stressful.",5
4639,"We got the blue one that is used for the default picture. IT was too small to use on my 11 month old's head, even on the largest setting. My advice would be to get another style because this does not fit the age it says.",2
4640,"This product was too big for my daughter's head. So we will try again in the next month or so. Overall it is ok.",3
4641,"Love this thing.  I can wear it under my clothes or just throw it in my pocket if need be.  Make sure you pull the straps very tight, though, for a secure hold!",5

4644,"This product did basically what it said it would do, which is to help mom's become hands free when pumping. I am fuller on top, so I always had to help it a little when I first started pumping. After the suction took hold, then I could let go,  though I never felt safe enough to do more than type with one hand or use the phone. But for only 10 dollars, you get what you pay for.",3
4645,"So far I have been very impressed with the performance of this stroller.  It is not a jogging stroller - rather, it is more appropriate for use in the city (as the name would suggest).  I have not had any trouble steering in parks, but it definitely steers most easily on sidewalks or roads.  The best part, though, has been the one-handed steering, which is essential since I also have a preschool age child walking with me much of the time.  Also, since I usually need two or three more hands than I have, the fact that it folds very easily makes outings that much better.  My younger child can face in either direction and the sun shade is large enough to provide good coverage over his face pretty much all the time.  I do feel that this is a bit overpriced compared to other similar models on the market, but it definitely is a high-quality and well constructed stroller.",4
4646,"This is a beautiful stroller.  It's sleek and designed well.  It's super light, way lighter than my other stroller, and yes I can open and close it with one hand.  Makes me feel like I won the rodeo!I have the Graco Modes Click Connect stroller and a Jeep Sport Stroller to compare it to, and I also test drove the Britax B but decided it was far too expensive.This Baby Jogger City Light is by far the quietest stroller of my three.  The Graco wheels are LOUD and janky.  This is a huge deal when your baby is trying to sleep in it.  I am impressed with the baby jogger wheel rotation effortlessly on the pavement, sidewalk and I've taken it onto dirt trail (hard packed, nothing that would be considered off roading).My Graco is able to turn the seat toward me so baby is facing me, or I can switch it so baby faces out.  This is a wonderful feature as I live on a steep hill and didn't want my baby toppiling out.  While the Baby Jogger and Jeep do not have this feature, the baby jogger does recline nicely for baby's comfort.I also like the harness and seat straps best on the Baby Jogger.  They're padded and of better quality than the Graco.Both have nice sun shade, which we use daily.  And both have nice amounts of storage under the stroller.I'm not thrilled that the Baby Jogger doesn't come with drink holders.  It's such a little thing, but I find it annoying.  Who doesn't take water with them on a walk?  The graco has two drink holders for me and a compartment to hold my cell phone and keys.  AND a drink snack tray for baby.  Surely this is an inexpensive accessory that Baby Jogger charges additionally for, but since I'm reviewing the stroller only I'm not taking off a star for that.  It's a very nice, easy to maneuver, nice looking stroller.  Love it!",5
4647,"AMAZING stroller!  It took me about 2 minutes to put together once out of the box.Very smooth ride.  My little one LOOOOVED riding in this stroller.  Not having a tray in front actually makes it much easier to get them in and out without getting stuck, but they are very securely fastened inside.  And the canopy, I can't rave about it enough.  It is definitely extra large, but it doesn't obstruct your view or your child's.  The canopy is very roomy at the top and not claustrophobic feeling even though it curves down, in fact one of my favorite features is how it curves down towards your little one just a bit.  I've found that I no longer have to have a sunhat, or baby sunglasses (neither of which stayed on for long) to shield the sun from eyes.  In other strollers my little one is often squinting (because she won't keep the hats or glasses on), but with this stroller she is shaded perfectly to the point that those things are necessary any more.  Doesn't seem to matter what angle the sun is in.  Another benefit is that I don't have to put sunscreen on her face as it's completely shaded.One of the things that they don't really mention in their product description is that it's surprisingly compact when closed.  Unlike my previous stroller which took up the entire back of my SUV because it would only fit horizontally in the space, this one fits vertically in the back so that I have half of my &#34;trunk&#34; space for other things.  I can take this stroller just about anywhere because I know I will have storage room to spare even with it in the back.  I no longer have had those moments when shopping, opening the back only to realize that I forgot to take the stroller out of the back before leaving the house.  That is so frustrating!  I don't have to worry about that anymore :)  If you have a minivan, then you can probably stand it up on end and have even more &#34;trunk&#34; space.Even with all of the other things I love about this stroller, the thing I love the most is how easily you can open, close and carry this stroller one handed.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the one hand open and close feature.  This works like a dream and is so lightweight you can easily handle this with one arm (especially nice if you are disabled or only have one arm)If you are tall, then this stroller will be a godsend as the handle seems to come up higher than others.  An older Chicco stroller we had did have an adjustable handle that you could tilt to a higher position but this handle is even better.  My sister is tall (5'10&#34;-5'11&#34;)  I'm around 5'5&#34;-5'6&#34; and it fits us both very comfortably without any adjustment.One thing that is kind of misleading from the name of the stroller is that it is a &#34;Baby Jogger City Lite&#34;, but is not intended for running.  The name of the brand is &#34;Baby Jogger&#34; and the model is &#34;City Lite&#34;.  I didn't get it for the jogging capability, but for the one handed closing /opening feature, and that it was lightweight, yet could carry up to 55 lb child, and had LOTS of storage. Not being a jogging stroller that wasn't a big deal for me, but it is something that you will want to note especially considering the style and maker.I know there are other strollers out there that cost more, that are supposed to be better, but I just can't imagine how that could be, nor that it would be necessary to pay more.  This stroller is perfect for me.  I would buy this stroller again and again and HIGHLY recommend it.  I've had three previous strollers in the past 5 years, and this one is by far the best one I've had.  BY FAR.  I wish I would have had this one to begin with because I would have saved myself so much money it's not even funny.  It has everything that I want in a stroller (once I bought a couple of the accessories) so I firmly believe this will be the last one I ever get.  I liked it so much that I gave one to my sister who needs a stroller that she can manipulate one handed, and she loves it just as much as I do.",5
4648,"I have a 3 month old child, and here are my 2 cents on both strollers. The baby jogger city lite stroller is a wonderful alternative to the BOB Revolution stroller.Pros of choosing baby jogger city lite:Way lighter/easier to pick up and load in your car which makes it easier on your backEasier to fold up than the BOBMore affordableCons to choosing the baby jogger over the BOB:The BOB is engineered with shocks for smoother ride when you hit bumpsThe BOB Can adapt to most infant seatsCity lite sits lower To the ground --( Remember to always carry pepper spray or some kind of defense with you. I was recently charged by a pit bull while walking. Luckily my baby was in his infant car seat in the BOB. If he was in the City stroller which is lower to the ground, he may have been seriously injured because he would have been without his car seat that sits up higher.)Bob has More accessories to fit strollerBob has Air filled tires which helps have a smoother rideOverall, if I had to choose between the two, I would probably choose the BOB because of the smooth ride and my infant is safer in his britax car seat which adapts into the BOB.For a more economical choice, I would choose the baby jogger city lite. Also, because it's way easier to lift, fold up and fit in your trunk.Both BOB and City lite strollers have their advantages. Both strollers are equipped to:Keep your baby safeAdjust to your baby's growthAllow for a great workout - jogging or walkingBoth take up around the same amount of space when engaged or folded upBoth have adequate shade and cover to protect baby's skinAllow for baby to see scenery once out of their car seat.Have storage space to put your belongings.Both are just as easy to snap your child in and out.Whatever jogger you choose, get a car seat adapter because it keeps your infant way safer!! .. From dogs, accidents, etc!",5
4649,"We were happy to try the Baby Jogger City Lite Stroller on a recent trip to Southern California including time at Sea World, multiple hotels, and walks on the boardwalk and around town. For the last few years, our main strollers have included the Bugaboo Cameleon and the Britax Blink. The Bugaboo is incredible but too substantial and not portable enough to road trips; it simply takes up too much space in the car. The Britax Blink is very compressible, but isn't tough enough to handle uneven landscape, feeling like a tough version of an umbrella stroller.We wanted something that would be tough enough to handle a wide variety of surfaces well and portable enough to go on quick trips to the zoo or cross-country road trips. This Baby Jogger City Lite is it. It is very portable, very easy to collapse, and as long as you are on hard surfaces, it will handle well. We appreciated how stable and sturdy it was, easily able to be pushed and steered with one hand and not the occupant doesn't feel every rock or crack in the road. The seat is comfortable and secure.Our main complaint is the method with which you secure the child into the seat. Instead of simple clasps, securing the shoulder/lap harness is more like getting a zipper started on a jacket. It is cumbersome and confusing at first. But after a couple, days it becomes easy to use. So if you are frustrated with this, just give it a few days; it gets easier.The Jogger title is potentially misleading. This is not a jogging stroller. When you push it too fast, the front wheel gets very turbulent, causing the whole thing to shake. The ""City"" description is more like it. It is not an off-road stroller; it will handle dirt paths fine, but gets stuck pretty quickly in sand or soft dirt.So if you are looking for a portable, easily collapsible, upper-low-end stroller, you should definitely consider the Baby Jogger City. If you are looking for a high-end, end, bugaboo-like stroller; this isn't it. Neither is this a jogging stroller.This is a great second stroller for being tossed into the back of your car and being ready for use around the city (errands) or vacation when storage space is at a premium.",5
4650,"I'm one of those people who are super picky about strollers. I prefer strollers to be lightweight, easy to fold and easy to maneuver. A couple of years ago I found that the Britax B-Agile was the closest to being my dream stroller than any other stroller I've ever had before it (and I've gone through a lot of strollers in my quest for the elusive &#34;perfect stroller&#34;). Two and a half years after getting a B-Agile it's still my favorite hands down, followed by the Baby Jogger City Mini stroller which is a very close second. That said, I fully expected the Baby Jogger City Lite to be just as good as the City Mini, but it's not.At the time I'm writing this review I have no idea what the price point for this stroller is since Amazon doesn't have a price listed.  I would assume that it must cost less than the Citi Mini based on a side by side comparison of the two stroller.  The Citi Mini is clearly the nicer stroller.  I has nicer fabrics, a canopy with SPF protection, nicer harness straps, and a better handle grip material.  The Citi Lite seems cheap by comparison on all counts.  The only feature that I like better on the Citi Lite is the folding mechanism.  Instead of having to snap the safety feature on to the stroller to ensure the stroller doesn't accidentally fold, this feature is automatic like the Britax B-Agile where releasing it prior to folding is as simple as pushing a button before pulling the strap that folds the stroller.  That is the one and only feature on this stroller that I feel is better than the Citi Mini.  Had I never had any other experience with Baby Jogger strollers prior to evaluating the City Lite I would tell you that they are cheap feeling strollers with fabrics that aren't even as nice as a cheap Graco stroller.The stroller feels like a bad hack version of the Citi Mini or Britax B-Agile.  It has a generous canopy, which is nice, but the fabric seems like it will not have any water resistance should you get caught out in the rain, and it has no SPF protection like some other Baby Jogger Stollers have.  The canopy itself also offers two peek a boo windows for viewing baby. The stroller folds up with a simple push of a button and the pull of a strap and self latches making fold up a snap. Handling for this stroller is just as good as the B-Agile  and Citi Mini which means you can easliy open a door and slip your stroller through with zero difficulty unlike most other strollers. The ride is nice for your little one and while it's not a jogging stroller, it does handle reasonably well on grass which is great if you're a soccer mom, like me. The basket underneath the stroller is a nice size. I actually prefer the basket on the B-Agile which I feel is a bit easier to access, but it's still better than many other strollers we have. The fabric upholstery for this stroller is rough and feels cheap compared to the B-Agile and Citi Mini.  Because of the texture of the fabric, it will not be easily spot cleaned if you have little messes here and there and that is a big part of why I dislike this stroller.  The fabric choice is not practical for toddlers who tend to make messes when eating snacks in the stroller. The harness straps are not difficult to adjust, but the straps don't adjust as easily as the Citi Mini harness. While I like the way you can adjust the straps on the Baby Jogger strollers, I do prefer the sliding height adjustibility of the B-Agile harness. With the City Lite you need to rethread the harness to adjust the strap height. The recline on this stroller goes back far enough that you can put a very young baby in it.When compared with the B-Agile and Citi Mini, the City Lite is a few pounds heavier than both of them.  It's still pretty light and easy to manage but it's not as light.  The seating area also appears to be a bit wider than the Citi Mini and B-Agile, but both of those strollers are plenty roomy so I'm not sold on the bit of extra room this stroller offers.  Years ago I had my then six year old sit in the Britax B-Agile and she fit even though she had long outgrown the need to ride in a stroller years before.  So even a bigger three or four year old would fit comfortably in the Citi Mini or B-Agile.As with the B-Agile, if you want a snack tray, parent console or an adaptor to hold an infant car seat, you'll have to purchase add on accessories.Overall, the City Lite is an ok stroller. I suppose if I had never had any experience with the Britax B-Agile or the Citi Mini I might have a better opinion of this stroller but as it is,  I like it considerably less than the B-Agile and Citi Mini. Both of them are excellent options if you are looking for a lightweight full size stroller and I urge you to check them out before making your final decision on a stroller.",3
4651,"First off, this is not a &#34;jogging&#34; stroller. It's sporty, but not really a sports or jogging stroller.Rugged strollers for outdoor activity or jogging need a stronger frame, a brake, larger wheels (for terrain, stability), and a front wheel that can lock/unlock on the fly. This doesn't have any of those features - though the Baby Jogger Summit X3 comes close (but is way overpriced at $429).I would call this an &#34;active&#34; stroller - it's light weight and perfect for the city market, day at the zoo, etc. I almost always prefer 3 wheel strollers, they are much more maneuverable, but most do not fold up well. This one does.The frame and some of the parts are a bit chintzy on this, I wouldn't really call it a high end stroller. But they make up for it in innovation. It's got so many little extras, the storage pocket, the quick release front wheels, etc. And there's lots of little extras you can find for these models (I was drooling over the storage bag for the stroller).I would add that this is not for newborns - in my opinion there's not enough support in the seat back if your child cannot yet hold up their head. But otherwise, it's versatile - probably 6 months all the way up to 55 pounds!The MSRP is about $175, which is a bit high (I think comparable strollers go for $119-$139 at Buy Buy Baby). But I think it's a smart design, versatile, and fun.",4
4652,"I have been very happy with these cups. They don't leak unless really given some force. The soft spot is easier for my little guy to drink from, especially as a transition phase from baby bottles.Pros:Handle disconnects - easier to clean, don't have to clean the handles with every use if they don't get dirtyLID! A lot of sippy cups don't have lids, and I really like having a lidCons:Soft spout does collapse a little with intensive sucking, but my son's never had a problem getting liquid outOverall, very happy with these cups.",5
4653,"Everything perfect, i love them, they came both of them and they are very nice! i will buy more! thanks",5
4654,"This is a nice, stretchy carrier to hold water bottles, tissues and other smaller sized necessities whether you travel with children, pets, or alone. The color is actually black, and not the dark grey like the picture shows. The top part is velcro so it can easily be adjusted to fit over the headrest of your car seat. The material seems nice and sturdy. I really like the convenience of this, and not having to go all the way in the back of my Ravi to grab something. Very nice product.",4
4655,"I love this diaper kit!  The diaper bag I had for my first child came with a diaper kit that folder into a little purse with a handle. It was great b/c I could stick a diaper & wipes in it and carry just that to rest rooms for changes (instead of lugging the whole diaper bag).  I still have it but it was a little too big for my new baby's diaper bag.  This product is small and pliable, but big enough to hold a diaper and wipes (I have a soft case).  The diaper pad itself if a nice size and soft, but very thin.",5
4656,"I like this. Here are my comments.1. This kit consists of a 22"" x 15 1/4"" changing pad and a small zippered bag (the very top is 12', but quickly tapers to 9'' and then 9 3/4""; it's 7"" from top to bottom). You can cram a couple of diapers and a small pack of wipes and some ointment in, but that's about it.However, this is not meant to replace a regular diaper bag. it's good for a quick outing to the park or a store, and takes up little room.2. The picture on Amazon shows a small child fitting completely onto the changing mat. That's for an infant. My 15 month old grandson definitely has his legs way over the edge, but enough of his body is on this for changing him.3. This does button onto the stroller, but because there is only one button, this dangles, so you have to make sure nothing falls out of the open outside pocket.4. This is made of neoprene and is easy to clean. Padding is minimal, so if you use this on the grass at a park, make sure there are no sharp objects (like stones or sticks) underneath.Bottom line: This is handy for those times when you don't need to bring along a regular diaper bag.",4
4657,"1)The color of the diaper kit looks very attractive.2) The diaper bag is light weight and yet can accommodate lot of the diaper essentials in it.3) The changing pad and the bag goes into one's hand bag quite easily.4) There is also a pocket provided to store the wipes case.5) What I like about this kit is that even after holding diapers and wipes, the main pouch has room for other essentials like travel size moisturizing cream, diaper rash ointment etc.",4
4658,"Having owned the Orbit Baby G2 Travel System stroller for my first baby, I was fascinated by the killer looks, neat features and hidden functionality of the frame to accept accessories. It was far from a perfect stroller, but it was a good alternative among a sea of Bugaboo strollers then.Now on it's third revision, there are seemingly indistinguishable changes and a lot has been carried over to this frame.WHAT'S THE SAME:1. Stroller frame dimension and weight are both the same.2. SmartHub - patented 360 degree rotation to use with the Stroller Seat, Infant Car Seat and Toddler Car Seat.3. QuadShock - shocks that supposedly absorb in all directions and not just up and down motion.4. One-handed fold action.5. Rubber no-pump tires that can be replaced should.WHAT'S DIFFERENT:1. Dual Cup Holders - the G2 had a single cup holder by the middle and two small &#34;pockets&#34; for your keys which honestly was a useless feature. The G3 now has a smarter use of it's space in between the handles by providing dual cup holders that are rectangular than round previously. One for your drink, and the other for your baby. Or because it's spacious, use it for your keys, mobile phone, etc.2. Flip Flop-friendly brakes. The previous G2 brakes had a simple, but awkward stepping motion that you had to apply with a bit of force to lock into the wheels. The latest G3 brakes now has a more complex designed but very simple to operate large foot pedals with  green colour on one side (left) and red colour pedal (right) on the other. You don't need to apply much force, just step on either and it easily glides down to lock and unlock the wheels.3. Although the actual handle bars look the same, they are not and I'm not loving this aspect. The handles are are now rounded tubes versus a triangular shaped tube that mimics the shape of the frame itself. I don't know why they updated it to a rounded shape, but the round tubes threw me off in design that didn't fit the look of the frame.Then the handles are now comfortably foamy pads versus hard rubber that looked elegant. The foam pads of the G3 look cheap and easy to get soaked versus the non-porous rubber handles with grip indentations of the G2.4. Removed Wrist strap. I admit I never used the odd wrist strap of the G2. You can either put it around your wrist or hook it to your belt so it does not sneak out from you from an undetectable slope. I'm glad they just improved the braking system a lot so it's very easy to use and eliminated the awkward strap that just dangled.5. Frame Colour is now offered in all black or grey. Black is definitely the way to go. I'm not liking the grey colour, I wish they retained the light grey colour of the G2 frame or did one better by offering a red frame instead. So black would be my only choice as it is more versatile to mix and match and classy to look at.INSTALLATION:Installation is intuitive and done in 5 minutes. As a previous G2 owner, I didn't have to read the manual. All you need to do once you are done removing the plastic wrapping and foam and cardboard packaging, is to simply unfold the frame and snap on all four wheels. The two wheels in front are smaller, while the two rear wheels are larger. Presto! Installation is done. Now all you need to do is put on the seat and any accessories you chose to purchase along with the G3 frame.OVERALL:The minor improvements are what matters and I have no real complaints on this G3 frame for now. The welding of the frame is neat and the black colour hides it better. The plastic parts remind me of German automobile plastic switches which are solid to the touch. The foam handle is a bit disappointing and time will tell how it stands to the four season weather I have.I will update my review as needed.",4
4659,"Very expensive a d doesn't come with the rotating base, which costs as much as a good car seat alone. It is definitely better purchased as a permanent installation, in my opinion. I think it's too heavy to consider carrying it, with a baby in it especially. Also, if you have a small car and more than one baby, this seat may not fit with another car seat installed. For sure, you can't put three across, as we need.It is very deep and seems very comfortable with a lot of padding for protection. It also comes with a built in latch system that stores in the back panel if you can't use it in your car. It's also designed to use with the seat belt sliding through the car seat, for a secure latch. It also has the over the seat latch when installed front facing.It doesn't have a &#34;base&#34;, but side impact pieces that keep the seat stabilized. The fit into special holes in the side of the car seat, then lock into place. There is also a level with a pretty wide range considered as ok, so it doesn't have to be perfect to have a good, safe installation.I found it best to attach the latch hooks, then put my knee in the car seat, with all my weight, and tighten the latch belt. I got a really solid installation, no movement at all, when I try to shake the car seat.It's a good car seat, but I think you can get just as good a car seat for a lot less money.Also, I wouldn't want to have to remove this seat to take the cover off to wash it, or even to adjust the harness straps.",3
4660,"This car seat is super easy to use and the rotation feature helps to prolong extended rear facing. It's so easy for a toddler to rear face in this car seat, and perhaps that's what's most important to us. It's made of the best materials and I like that the pieces can be washed. It's smaller than our britax advocate but wider than our clek foonf. Overall, this is the best rear facing car seat we've used!",5
4661,"If you didn't use the Orbit Baby infant seat, don't waste your money on this seat as a convertible seat.  It does not come with a base and a base costs another $200 making the set $600!  The benefit of this seat over other convertible seats is the ability to rotate it to put baby in easier while rear facing.  Without the base, this is not possible.The seat is heavy and bulky and honestly, I cannot imagine lifting it with a baby in and out of the car to put in a stroller.  I do not have any other Orbit Baby items, so I cannot truly comment on how easy it is to do or if it is worth it.If you are looking for a new convertible car seat and are new to Orbit Baby, I recommending looking elsewhere.  It is one of the most expensive seats, but that does not make it the best.  I use a Britax, Diono Radian, and Graco.  In fact, I have 2 Britax (one FF, one RF) and a Diono (RF) all in a row, but I do not see how this would fit in the row with any of them (I have a Chevy Traverse).",3
4662,"The Orbit toddler seat was delivered in a large outer box by FedEx.  There was a large sticker on the box that said &#34;HEAVY.&#34;  That was an understatement!  Getting that large box inside and through the door was a challenge.  Getting it out of the outer box and then out of the manufacturer's box continued the challenge.  This is a large, heavy seat.  That does make it appear to be very solid and should provide protection if it is involved in an accident.There is a base you can buy separately to install in the car so you can then snap this seat into it.  That base can only be used with the seat in the rear facing direction.  If you are planning to use it forward facing, don't bother with the base.  It does come with side impact braces, which are used if the base is not as well as when it is used in the forward facing position.The instruction book is very thorough.  It gives instructions for all possible situations.  Rear facing instructions are in blue and forward facing are in red, making it easy to find the directions you need.  There are even directions for using this as a restraint system on airplanes.  I would say, good luck getting this on the plane.  Did I mention how heavy it is?  There is a stroller base, which I do not have nor do I plan on purchasing, but again, due to the weight I would find it challenging to transfer from the car to the stroller base.  You may be a weight lifter and enjoy the extra workout, but that's not me!I do like the fact that the headrest is adjustable and that there are 4 levels of slots for the restraint harness.  There is a rear access panel, which provides a place to store the manual as well as the rear tether.  There is also a front access panel that contains the plate you will need to access to adjust the crotch buckle.  The manual is very thorough and had lots of pictures.  If this is the first seat you have ever installed, you may find it a bit overwhelming.  Many fire departments offer assistance in installing car seats.  You might want to check them out or at least have them make sure you did install it properly.  My car dealership has a service adviser certified to make sure the seat is installed correctly.  It is peace of mind to do this.",4
4663,"First off I think it's ridiculous a car seat that mostly talks about the convenience of being able to swivel your kid getting in and out that doesn't come with the base is a little confusing. I assumed it did. So now I'm wondering if I should fork out the extra 215 for the base, but I'm not in love with this car seat. If you decide to buy the base it now becomes a 600+ car seat, seems a little steep and ridiculous to me.My daughter is rear facing, this one seems to be oddly more up right than my current car seat. I also don't think she looks comfortable in it. Also where's a cup holder? Seriously? For 400 there's not even a single cup holder?This was a pain to put into my Rogue, it would fit much better in a larger SUV. This definitely won't be going in my husbands challenger.Do lots of research before forking out all the money for this car seat. If you can take a look at it at a local store, I'd highly recommend that, I searched here in salt lake and couldn't find them in store, physically. You can buy it but there's nothing to look at.",3
4664,"As a previous owner of the Orbit Baby G2 Travel System, I can see that there are a few seemingly simple changes done to this Orbit Baby G3 Stroller Seat versus the G2 Stroller Seat.For one, the harness system has been updated to be more secure. Now in order for a child not to remove the belts on their own, Orbit has designed a two-step process that requires you to depress on the red button of the belt while also depressing the usual plastic hook found in all child belts. They are banking on the fact that this simultaneous process is difficult for a child to do. Even if it's a simple process, to make it work you will need both your hands free. It cannot be done one-handed.BELTSThe threading of the belt has been improved as well. Behind the seat cover there are plastic tabs that you just slide the belts depending on the shoulder height of your child. It's easier to operate and it's obviously cheaper to build.HANDLE BARThe handle bar has been simplified as well. Gone is the exterior velcro padded cloth that acts as a bumper and was also washable. Now you have a simple foam padded bar that looks like the bar of the G2 when you remove the padded cloth.FOOT RESTI may be wrong, but I believe the snack tray and the foot rest are carry over parts from the G2. The snack tray is still clunky in installation and removal despite being functional. It is worth nothing that they claim it to be BPA and PVC free.The foot rest on the other hand I have had no qualms in build and operation I don't mind it being carried over.REAR VENTILATIONThe rear ventilation has been simplified as well by removing the zipper covers to vent. For the G3 they simply exposed the vent. I guess there really is no big difference in having readily exposed vents versus a pretend cloth to cover the vent.SUN SHADEPart of the cost measure is eliminating the previously included sun shade which explains why it is now $80 cheaper. They encourage you to personalize the colour of the sun shade by buying it separately, of course. So previous owners who are not aware of this change may skip buying a sun shade when ordering only to find there is none included in the box. So make sure to purchase one from the get go so you have a complete system to build and use from day one.The result of all these is a visually slimmer frame. Oddly enough the specs and weight of the G3 and G2 are still the same so I don't know if the design simplicity and weight savings translated somewhere else to bring the weight back up.THE REAL ISSUE:Now design improvement or not, my real problem with the G2 stroller seat is that the latch is the weakest part. People like myself have experienced the failure of the latch such that the hook breaks internally leaving your seat stuck to the stroller frame. The only recourse is to tediously break into the side plastic of the seat so you can grab onto the metal hook to tug and release the seat. In the meantime, you wait patiently for the replacement seat from Orbit Baby and hope that it doesn't re-occur outside of your 2 year warranty.This can be a traumatizing experience especially if you have a small car and no way of fitting the stroller and seat in your trunk still attached and a turn off for previous Orbit Baby G2 owners.So I am hoping that Orbit has learned their lesson and improved on the latch a thousand times over so they can win back previous owners like myself and have first-time owners have no idea of what we were complaining about.In this regard, time will tell as I put more mileage into the seat. I will update my review as needed.OVERALL:So crossing my fingers that they have improved on the latch, I enjoy this seemingly simpler and more cost-effective seat. The 360 hub rotation is still there as well as the adjustable foot rest. The incline of the seat is adjustable as in the previous model.If you are a G3 Frame owner, then purchasing this is a no-brainer. Just make sure you also purchase a sun shade with the colour of your choice as none is included in the box.",4
4665,"I love this basket but wished it came with the stroller already!  I usually remove it if I don't need it to make to stroller lighter. I have the G2 frame and it fits great.",4
4666,"READ THE MANUAL on how to install this. Having graduated from the Orbit Baby Cargo Pod, I was about to give this Cargo Basket a 1 star rating until I read the simple manual on how to properly install it. The issue is that I was already used to using their original Cargo Pod which simply slides into place that I thought it was the same thing for this Cargo Basket.When I slid this basket into the frame rails, the whole bottom was sagging underneath that if you place just about anything on the basket, the cloth will drag onto the floor. I was scratching my head Orbit could not have badly designed it with this kind of flaw. And then I picked up the seemingly simple manual.By the front of the basket there are two innocent looking clips. You tug and pull the metal frame on both sides until it reaches the front part of the actual stroller frame. You will notice that the stroller frame has hidden holes covered by plastic that retract. You snap the innocent looking plastic clips into the holes of the stroller frame and there you have it - a very spacious and secure Cargo Basket that mimics the cargo basket of other strollers.I would highly recommend this Cargo Basket instead of the Cargo Pod if you already have a baby bag and if you feel that you need to carry more than what the Cargo Pod can hold. The Cargo Pod is very neat. But by having that initially, I ended up purchasing the Bassinet which made the stroller very wide - visually.Now on my second Orbit Baby stroller, I opted for this Cargo Pod so I can skip the Bassinet and instead have a proper baby bag to hang at the rear of the stroller.As usual with Orbit Baby, the material of this Cargo Basket is top notch. It is Oeko-Tex certified which simply means it is ""healthy and clean"".Features:1. Holds up to 5 lbs (2kg)  with a capacity of 6.5 gallons (25 liters).2. This is not obvious at all, but it sas reflective side panels on the left and ride for safe strolling at night.3. Has two zippered pockets for additional storage. It cannot house bottles in these side pockets, but flat objects like paperwork, tickets, wallets, money, etc.If you have an Orbit Baby G3 stroller, I would highly recommend this Cargo Basket. But please ensure to install it properly so the cloth will not snag underneath.ONE MORE THING:There is a hitch on this basket if you are using the Side Kick attachment (skateboard) like myself. The Cargo Basket alone can fold with the stroller no problem. The Side Kick attachment alone can fold with the stroller no problem as well. But if you have both attachments together, they will both snag against each other with the metal wires of the Carbo Basket rubbing against the wood of the skateboard. The solution is to meticulously fold one against each other slowly versus being able to twist and slam the stroller frame shut. When you unfold the stroller, you will have to carefully do the same. Otherwise you will end up with a not so pretty looking banged up wooden skateboard down the road.This is the reason why I have reduced the rating to 4 out of 5. The Side Kick is officially supported for the G3 so I am a bit disappointed with the two accessories not being good together.",4
4667,"The Orbit Baby G3 Stroller Sunshade is a great item and brand to have. I don't want the sun directly in my child&#8217;s face, and this does the job perfectly! Plus every time I look at it, it looks fantastic and modern! The best part for me is that I can easily pull it back and down and it completely covers my child in the back (so she can see his Tablet screen). Though the price is high but for good reason. I cannot recommend this product enough!",5
4668,"This was a very cute print and it fit perfectly to my mini crib! I will buy some more again! Super soft too.",5
4669,"They fit a 6'' mini crib mattress very well, however the sheet is also rough and over priced. It sucks that this particular size (6'') is so difficult to find that you feel forced to pay this much.",3
4670,"this is great, it protects the car seat from overheating which avoids it releasing harmful chemicals and allows you to put your baby/toddler into the seat without having to wait for it to stop being too hot.",5
4671,"I love this wubbanub.  it is so cute and soft and the little ears are great for little hands.  I wanted my little one to love this as much as I thought she should.  Unfortunately...  i have a thumb sucker.  She is not interested in pacifiers at all.  I'm pretty bummed but its certainly not this amazing wubbanub's fault.  I'll have to break her with the thumb at some point...",5
4672,"My baby is definitely hooked on Wubbanub. I have purchased 6 different ones so far(within the last 20 months). They are all cute, soft and cuddly. The Wubbanub Mary Meyer Gardenia Bunny Plush Pacifier, Purple is our favorite by far because of it's unique design and unusual colors. When we are out and about people comment on it all the time. It very cute and definitely a life saver during the infamous toddler meltdowns in public. I bought a couple for two of my pregnant friends also.",5
4673,"This wifi baby monitor is definitely cool.  It has a lot of bells and whistles, like music, night vision, talking to the baby, etc., but it's not perfect.  First, the iPhone app is not good at all.  AT ALL!  It crashes constantly and sometimes you can't see the kids.Second, the build is a little awkward.  Just not a fan.Still, it's a decent camera and we are using it on a daily basis.",3
4674,"The camera is solid and provides stunning HD video and the night vision is superb. The base is very sturdy and rubberized compared to many of the cheap plastic cameras on the market.  It stays put once you get it in the right position.Worth noting: There is no remote pan/tilt with this unit; surprising give the MSRP. You have to manually adjust and that requires removing the camera &#34;eye&#34; from the base&#34; socket&#34; each time. Minor annoyance.The big problem (and the reason for the low star rating) is with the Android Application. I encountered consistent trouble getting it to connect/reconnect after setup. It just isn't reliable.",2
4675,"I have used quite a few baby monitors, from the first ones to do video using a black and white CRTto the newer LCD versions with all the bells and whistles.  One problem I'd that they all have the same problem, due to the architecture and arrangement of our home it is very difficult to sustain a signal from the baby's room to ask parts of the house.This is finally solved now that we have a reliable and easy to use way to monitor through WiFi.  We have repeaters in the house too maintain the Wi-Fi signal so now the baby monitor signal travels to all corners of the house as well.My experience with the setup, interface, apps, and overall use it's pretty much in line with what others with good experiences have had with the unit",5
4676,"I had no problem setting this up on my phone. I love the simplicity of use with this camera. I set this up in my playroom and I can watch the kids while I work. They are just down the hall, but this allows me to see them without actually being in the same room. I can set my phone up right next to my computer and I have a crystal clear view and audio so I can keep tabs on what they are up to. The visual quality is really stunning. Even on a small screen the picture is detailed and high quality. The audio is easy to adjust, and comes across clear. I can hear them when they whisper even. Overall I think this is a great for daytime use. I don't feel great about using it at night over wifi, for a whole host of reasons.",4
4677,"After using it more than month and several attempts to make it work as advertised, I can very confidently say that:- The lens and optical capabilities of this camera are really superb. The picture quality is very good and motion sensing really works well.- Designed to look cute and ideally suited for used on a flat surface like table. Mounting this camera can be a bit challenge, depending on location etc.- It is wi-fi dependent and you have to ensure a good wi-fi connection across the range of camera and your phone, otherwise the signal drops. Signal strength at our place is very good and consistent since the router is mounted on the ceiling.- It is most reliable if your phone and camera are on the same wi-fi network.- Several attempts to register and make a login via their app failed. The app keeps crashing or freezing on one screen. So, i was never able to test the remote viewing capabilities of this camera.- This camera will keep your phone engaged as your phone screen is your monitor.It causes sometimes unreliable streaming if you end up using your phone while the DLink baby app is running in background.Overall, it is a good baby camera, but will be an excellent choice if DLink can fix the app issues.",3
4678,"This works nicely to check on my house during the day or in the kids rooms at night.  We plan to buy more of these.",4
4679,"The D-Link Wifi Day/Night HD Baby Camera is a decent option to get if you are in the market for an &#60;$200 unit. This unit works off of Wifi and accessible via an app from your smart phone or tablet. As a baby monitor, the D-Link works great - nice resolution, the microphone is clear and picks up minute detail. There is no pan or tilt options which would have been nice but then this is a sub $200 camera so it's not totally expected. The nicest option has to be the pic storage.  You can take pics with monitor and the data is stored on a memory card. The lullabye is pretty cool too. Never used - but still cool to play with.The main problem with this product is the sometimes glitch app and the unit just doesn't like to establish a connection. It's not a often occurrence, but happens enough to be noticeable and annoying.Overall, a good product - Recommended!",4
4680,"This product was so easy to set up and install, and works so seamlessly with my smartphone, that I am amazed at some of the other reviews. For me, the convenience of being able to see the baby no matter what room I am in in the house is priceless. The people who are complaining that you should be able to use a computer to monitor the baby should simply find another product that does that particular function if it is so important to them. Most people own at least a smartphone (if not a tablet), so I do not understand why this is such a big issue. The product works great, and, while not inexpensive, is still worth every penny for the peace of mind it brings. A wonderful baby monitor!",5
4681,"I didn't have any issues getting this camera to connect via wi-fi. However, I was not super impressed with the app itself. I have a Samsung Galaxy s4 and when I went to try to take a picture or record video via the app it tells me that these features are not available for Android devices (which can be frustrating, because I didn't remember seeing information about some features only being available for iPhones . . . which not everyone owns).I liked being able to get information about room's temperature and I liked being able to access the camera when I was away from home (you can view it via wi-fi from any location). However, I liked my standard video monitor much better for everyday (and nighttime) use. I liked being able to play music or speak through the monitor, but I occasionally got HORRIBLE feedback as it picked up the sound of my voice speaking through the camera.There are some nice features, but it's not something I plan on using on a daily basis. It's easier just to use my other monitor and not worry about it draining my phone battery running the app. I was afraid I would miss the notifications if I didn't have it running the background noise -which is a greater drain on the battery. Maybe there's just more of a learning curve with this one, but we'll see.Again, it's great if you want to access a camera away from home, but if I'm in the house, I prefer my other monitor due to ease of use.",3
4682,"This is the second D-Link camera I received for review, and even though this model is a newer one, it seems to have less functionality. This is disappointing, since the camera looked, and sounded good on paper.First the good parts: the image quality is good, and setup is easy (in fact if you're into tinkering with devices, it can also work as a generic wifi cam). The integrated sd recording, and two way audio are nice additions.However those do not make up for the missing parts. Given the price range of the camera, there are better alternatives, that provide:- Pan and tilt- A better mount (I had to mount it upside down, since it would not stay straight)- Auto focus (or even better app controlled focus) - this required manual focus with the ring around the lens- Optical zoomIf this had been an entry level camera these omissions would not have been a problem. However you can get a better value for your money elsewhere.",3
4683,"This thing is great. Assembly only requires a Phillips screw driver for two small screws. The chair and activity tray is held by four nylon straps. The attachment does not seem secure at first glance because the loop is held by a clip with an opening in the middle, but once the strap is in place properly and the clip with strap is snapped into the chair and activity tray assembly, it's very secure.As noted by someone else, the chair does not turn as easy as i would like, (A bearing swivel assembly would fix this.) but none of the other brands that we had looked at swivel easily, so I can't fault the bouncer for this. The chair is adjustable to three heights.The activities are captivating for our little guy. He loves the wheel station.",5
4684,"Love this jumper. It is so bright and colorful. All the little doodads work great and really keep my 5 month old's attention. She was able to fit in it just fine at 4 months old on the first level and still touch the floor. She is average height and weigh.2 complaints - the seat is a little hard to turn, so my little one hasn't figure out that she is capable of turning the seat yet because it stays in one position without some fairly significant pressure from my husband or me. Second, the music only comes on when you push the buttons. My daughter goes crazy with excitement when we push the buttons to play the music. Wish it had a constant on button or better yet, would play the music when she interacts with other parts of the jumper - like if she spins the wheel for example (similar to how the FisherPrice Jumperoo plays music when you push on different parts of the toy).",5
4685,"Since this is such a popular stroller I expected more. It's good, but could be better. For the price, I would want a few things improved. And to fully get what I want, I know the price would go up even more.I like that I can fold it 1 handed. I dislike that it's impossible for me to unfold 1 handed.I like the basket, but wish it was a little bigger.It's not as smooth to control and steer. This was my husband's biggest complaint. I agree, it's a little wiggly compared to our cheep umbrella stroller. I'm willing to put up with it because I like the wheels, height, and comfort better than the umbrella stroller., But yes, it's not a smooth ride. You can lock the front wheel to make it smoother, but then you have no turning ability. So if you are going straight fine, but if you want to turn at all on a walking path, then you don't want it locked and it's &#34;wiggly.&#34;  The 4 wheel type strollers would help solve this issue.At 19lbs, it's still kind of heavy. But I made that sacrifice to get the &#34;extras.&#34; But it would be nice if it was less.I think it's a little over priced, maybe it's because I want the price of this for the fanciness of the more expensive models.",4
4686,"I am giving this rating taking into consideration that with coupons and a sale price I only paid a little over $100 for the entire system. The only reason it gets 4 stars is that you have to purchase the front bar/cup holder separately and it is not as sleek- looking as similar products. It's worth noting that this is the first and only stroller/travel system I have ever owned.I love that both pieces seem to be very light. I can carry the stroller with one hand, and even though my daughter is 9 months old and weighs A LOT, I can carry the seat with one arm (important to stress ARM, not hand).The base that comes with the system is very easy to install and has leveler on it so you don't have to use a pool noodle like with some of the other ones. I have had to strip the seat twice to wash it and it was easy to disassemble and reassemble. I need to wash the stroller cover but it looks way more difficult so I haven't made an attempt yet.One thing I have a complaint about is that the storage pocket on the back is really weird. It's right behind the seat so when you lean the seat back, the velcro holding the pocket to the stroller comes loose and it hangs down. It also comes loose sometimes when folding the stroller, and also when you put the canopy down it pulls it loose because they are attached to each other. We haven't yet been able to figure out exactly how to fasten it so that we don't have this problem. It's really annoying because when you put things in the pocket it just swings back and forth and hangs low and looks sloppy.Overall this is a great bargain, and wherever you buy it from check if they have the warranty with it. If anything happens they refund you the full price of the system :) I do recommend this stroller!",4
4687,"I love this system. Love the safety of the infant car seat, car seat snaps easily into base & stroller. I love the stroller. Simple to open & close, pushes very easily and I lay my newborn in stroller for walks (verses car seat ) and it's like a bassinet with a slight angle. So much better for his hips & alignment during our long walks!!!",5
4688,"Everything perfect, i love it, Its an excellent britax price and quality are great! i love it really! thanks for all",5
4689,"Pros:- Sturdier than most baby products out there.- Stroller is so easy to use!! Light weight! Folds easy! Doesn't tip over! Maneuvers well!- Material is so durable that you can wash it and it dries fast!!  Good quality!!Cons:- Baby car seat is so heavy, I would not recommend if you have to carry this upstairs.  I did sprain both my wrists and now I have to just leave it in the car and buy a heat protector so it doesn't overheat.- Wish it came in more colors.- Baby will overheat in the summer bc of the material.-",5
4690,"I've had many people comment on how nice our travel system is, especially the stroller!  It has a fast folding mechanism that works well and between the car seat and stroller provides enough shade that our baby can continue to take his nap without the interruption of having sunlight shine in his eyes.  We purchased a Britax cup and storage unit that compliments the stroller.  The stroller is easy to maneuver and seems to do well over all kinds of terrain.  Once the base is installed, it is a simple move to pull a latch and lift the car seat out.  Once the baby is in the stroller things move along pretty well..  When you go to remove the car seat and return it to your car the detachment is a lot more difficult.  You have to reach over your baby and put one hand on either side of the car seat and lift it up.  It would be nice if there were able to design a better system like the car seat to base has.  Overall we are happy with the travel system.The main drawback is that our baby tends to sweat in his car seat.",4
4691,"Such a piece of mind! I just wish there was a quick button on the parent monitor to turn it off. I always forget when I pick my baby up and it sets it off, so the alarm goes off on the baby unit...turn it off and the adult alarm goes off for losing connection (although I think that can be changed I just haven't figured out how yet). An off button for the entire monitor would be really convenient to push quick before grabbing baby. But I don't care. It's a great product and well worth the money. You do need to buy a small piece if wood to place under your mattress if the mattress isn't already on a solid hard surface. Just FYI. ;)",4
4692,"This thing is THE BEST. we use the dr browns bottles (unfortunately, FIVE parts!), and are constantly washing bottles and parts. This rack has a narrow footprint, is shockingly sturdy and holds SO much. My sister bought it first for her new baby, and when we saw it, we immediately bought it too. It folds down totally flat and can easily be washed. Love it!",5
4693,"I bought this for my 9mo' old because we had one for my little brother when I was a kid. I expected it to be $9 worth of a gate, compared to our safety plastic, door-having one. Plastic one sucks and is a B* to set up.I set this one up to block our kitchen, forgot it was there, walked full-speed into it and nearly flipped over the thing. It was THAT sturdy. I know my son (once he's walking/running) can run head first into this gate 12mph and he's not getting into the kitchen. LOL.Well worth the money, I hope the quality stays this good when it comes time for baby #2. (:",5
4694,"I was skeptical that these would stay put with our very active 10 month old who is in to EVERYTHING.  They are so great.  I wish we would have purchased them sooner than we did!",5
4695,"The blue color of this diaper bag looks even better in real life than it does online.  It is absolutely stunning and both my wife and I are in love with it.  It's a nice bag too, with a leather diaper pod that can pass for a clutch when the kids get too old for diapers.  There's a changing pad, wet bag, an insulated bottle bag (which is awesome because when a sippy leaks, it ruins everything).It's a decent size (though I think we've been spoiled by having some absolutely massive bags) and appears to be well constructed.  You'd never know this wasn't leather if they didn't tell you!  The handles appear to be securely riveted on, and the zippers work well.  The inside is a plasticky material that appears to be reasonablyEven though it's blue, it's still sort of feminine...maybe it's the saddle color?  When I walk around with it, I look less like a man with a murse than a guy carrying his wife's bag... his wife's AWESOME colored bag! :)",5
4696,"Pros: The nipple is a lot more comfortable than the typical bottle nipples, the bottle is BPA-free (a must!), the grip on the bottle is more comfortable than average.Cons: None observed yet. After 30 days of use, I have not experienced the lack of durability that others are reporting.",5
4697,"A few months ago we got to try out the Munchkin Latch bottles, and I praised them with setting the standard for what bottles should be. If you haven't had your baby try one out yet, I highly recommend you do. This Lansinoh bottle is nearly equal to the Munchkin in every way, just a little smaller.Seeing as how the baby that's been using it can't type or write, I can't get her to tell you about why this is a good product. However, I can tell you that she's never had any problems when drinking from this bottle, whether it's milk or juice or water. She took to the bottle instantly, as if it were the real thing, and never refused to drink from it. In fact, she plays with it and pinches it just like she does when getting her milk directly from the source. That's a good sign. No tummy aches either after multiple uses.I can't say much else for this bottle, given that I don't use it, and I'm not about to try out a baby's bottle for myself to determine the score to give. It's a quality product, works wonderfully and has a nice soft rubber nipple that feels different from a few others we've used. I say get a couple of Munchkins and a couple of these and you're set until it's time to move on.",5
4698,"It took a while for me to write this review because I wanted to try this bottle against a couple of others.  i primarily breast fed my baby until about 3 months when I had to return to work.  About 3 weeks before my return to work I started looking into bottles to feed my baby to help him adjust to bottle feeding at day care.  I tried a few, but my favorites were the tommee tipped and lansinoh momma bottles.  Months later, our favorite hands down is the Lansinoh mOmma.  This nipple and bottle is a completely different shape than the tommee tipped closer to nature, and although my son now does fine on both, the transition was easier on this one.This bottle is easy to clean, as well as the nipple. The cap has a flat surface, so you can sit it on its side without it rolling away.  The cap closes down on the nipple so if the bottle still has liquid, it won't leak from the nipple into the cap.  The base on the nipple has some texture, which I guess we both like.  The nipple doesn't collapse either.  You just have to make sure you read the directions and put the nipple through the ring through the top, not pull it through the ring.  I used to have concern about nipple confusion, but I honestly don't think he would have had issues with it at all.  I will stay that I still nurse or use this bottle to feed my son breastmilk, whichever makes sense based on the situation.",4
4699,"I think this is a great bottle, and the nipple appears to be &#34;breastfed baby friendly&#34;. I offered it to my older baby (who is still breastfed, but has trouble with cups) and he used it with no complaints. We typically use the Avent bottles, but I feel this would also be a great option as well. It is also easy to clean and doesn't have a million parts like some bottles on the market (drives me nuts!). As a mom to 4 (soon to be 5), I try to keep things simple and this is just that.",4
4700,"As we are on our 4th child now...  I've surprisingly achieved an education on baby bottles that I didn't expect to have.  Before this bottle, I'd have to say that the Advent bottles were my favorite.  I was really tired of trying to effectively clean a bottle using a bottle brush and the full dissembly of the advents were very nice.  But there's more to a bottle than how easy it is for ME to clean  -- but how well the baby can drink from it.  And he does very well with the naturalwave nipple... which is really what counts.  The  assembly and disassembly has its own bent and you get used to the getting the nipple locked into place.The only downside compared to the advent is needing to use a bottle brush again...  but I'm OK with that.  We will get more of these",4
4701,"This is a great bottle. My son who was being picky with his bottles didn't like anything we gave him until this one. It is a great shape and easy to hold. It is also very easy to clean. I hated other bottles that were very time consuming to just get washed. This one is very simple. My son loves it and he doesn't burp sometimes since he is not filled with air in his tummy.",5
4702,"Baby bottles are a must when mommy is not there to breastfeed or when traveling to visit family and friends.  We like this bottle's multiple functions of being used to work with the Lasinoh breast pump, milk storage, and feed the baby.  The nipple is nicely designed with a air vent system to prevent colic and regurgitation, soft and pliable with a retentive surface for our baby to latch on.  Our baby fed without effort with these bottles.  The only slight concern was the need to buy different nipples for different flow rates.  Overall: an easy to hold, use, clean/sterilize, and BPA free baby bottle which closely duplicates natural breastfeeding movements.",4
4703,"I wouldn't say this is the bottle to use if your breastfeeding. The flow comes out pretty fast it basically a regular cheap bottle. But I love there hand pump  just not the bottle sorry",1
4704,"We really like this bottle. I'm a firm believer in the venting, but usually that means extra parts to disassemble and clean. Here they have built the venting valve right into the nipple itself, thus keeping things simple. My wife commented on the nice nipple and the good sealing arrangement. The price is certainly a lot more reasonable than some other bottles we have looked at, yet it appears to be top quality throughout. I also like the practical, non-gimmicky shape of the bottle.I guess the incoming air does bubble through the milk to some degree, but for us that has never caused any problem.",5
4705,"I stay home and breastfeed, so I simply do not use bottles very often. When I do use a bottle I want it to be simple, without a lot of parts, easy to clean, and most importantly my baby has to like it. This bottle completely fit the bill. It takes me no time at all to clean this bottle. It comes apart really easily and assembles just as fast. My baby takes it without any fuss and seems to actually enjoy it! I have never had any leaks with this in the diaper bag. I am able to use it in my bottle warmer without any problems. Overall, this is the best bottle I have tried (of many) and it is going to be my one and only from here on out.",5
4706,"I really like that this bottle doesn't have liners, seals, or other stuff to mess with. The soft nipple makes the bottle feel &#34;natural&#34; and it's an easy bottle to hold. I read a few reviews that said the nipple collapsed. It seems like most bottles these days are trying to go with the thinner plastic on the nipples as it feels more natural, but it also causes collapse. The best way I have found to prevent that is to pull (add resistance) on the bottle as the baby eats. All on all, I like this no frills bottle.",4
4707,"Great for When You can't Feed baby yourself, she can still get momma's milk when daddy or anyone else feeds her, the nipple flow and shape simulate breast feeding.",5
4708,"This bottle seems really nice, and certainly was easy to clean.  Unfortunately, the baby did not accept it.I suppose it was an issue with the shape, but after a couple of weeks of trying, we've had to put this one aside.Suggest trying it for your little one, but know that every baby is different.",3
4709,"wish they provided glass bottle options.  The nipple is awesome and he latches to it better then other nipples.  More glass please!",4
4710,"My two month old is exclusively breastfed. We do use pumped milk on occasion when I need to be away from baby so a good bottle is a must. I wanted a bottle that was fairly uncomplicated (without tons of parts to clean and assemble), had a good flow (not too fast as this can cause issues with going back and forth from breast to bottle), vented somehow to prevent suction building up and baby swallowing air, had a design that my baby could latch easily to, and above all a bottle that wouldn't interfere with breastfeeding. In my quest to find a bottle that meets all of these requirements I've tried a slew of brands (Avent, Dr. Brown's, Tommy Tippee, Playtex, etc.) and one way or another every last one of them failed us somehow. Then I tried the mOmma. Being made by Lansinoh (the premier name in breastfeeding supplies, in my opinion) I was very hopeful about this product and Lansinoh did not disappoint. My little one latches well, the flow is just right, he doesn't suck air (his burps post-feeding are small, if he even has burps!), and the design of the bottle is perfect: simple to assemble and a breeze to wash. There's a small air vent at the edge of the nipple that allows air in as baby eats but doesn't allow milk to come out when turned upside-down.I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this bottle and am actually planning on purchasing more of them. All in all an excellent product!",5
4711,"First off I want to be clear that we are not using bottles on a regular basis.  I primarily nurse my daughter and only have to have a bottle available for the those times I am not present.  The bottle search is a frustrating one and every baby is different in their likes and dislikes so it is mainly trial and error.  We have had success with this bottle so far as my daughter likes it and it is easy to clean.  We did not have immediate success like this with Avent and of course we were given several Avent bottles.  I would consider purchasing more of this particular Lansinoh brand with the NaturalWave Nipple.  Just be sure you select this particular one and not the other older version.",4
4712,"Lansinoh has a baby bottle with a naturawave nipple. The nipples on the bottle are all interchangeable (like most bottle companies) so you can use a slow, medium or fast nipple as your baby grows. It uses an air ventilation system (AVS) which reduces intake of air- a potential cause of colic or spit up. It is BPA free and the nipple is made of 100% silicone.Most bottles we tried in the past are all similar. This bottle does have fewer parts - making it easy to assemble and clean as they state. But I prefer the ones with more parts and venting system as I find baby liked them alot better. The one thing I really dislike  is the cap / lid. Most baby bottles leak, if cap comes off, and nipple hits something they just drip out. Its a fact. But the cap on this/lid easily twists off, so if its not on right, or tight or gets bumped, it will undo... and I highly dislike that. It's nice to have things open easy but I think its way to easy and that = lots of spills. Would recommend other bottles and recommend that you test some out in the store and see how they open and close etc.",2
4713,"As a mom I prefer to breast feed but when I can't, this bottle is a great supplement due to the shape and it makes it easy to switch from bottle to breast easily.",5
4714,"This bottle is &#34;ok&#34; but doesn't seem to work for us.  He gets too much air which means too much gas for our little guy.",3
4715,"I breastfeed primarily,  but I like to have a few bottles on hand &#34;just in case.&#34; I always try to use ones that make it easy to transition back and forth from breastfeeding to bottle. I don't have a Lanisoh pump, so I can't comment on connecting the bottle directly to it, but the bottle itself is easy to use (and there are different speed flows available that let you adjust as the baby grows). I think it was fairly easy to clean and use.",4
4716,"I use this when taking care of my niece. It took a few times coaxing her to use it, but she appears to be used to it now. As for the air flow system preventing burps and indigestion, it's hard to tell if it works. I have never used another bottle to compare to. As for cleaning, it is quite easy to do. I always wash this by hand, and have never had an issue cleaning it thoroughly. All in all this is a good bottle to have on hand.",5
4717,"Like the wide-mouth bottle for easy cleaning. My little one takes to this bottle easily and I thought the NaturalWave Nipple shape helps as well as it closely resembles the mother's breast. The nipple is softer than most bottles making it easier for my girl to suckle on it.The quality of the bottles is good and durable. Its BPA free too, which is almost a standard with most bottles - so no surprise here.Overall, good quality bottle that cleans easy.",4
4718,"I rated Lansinoh momma bottle 4 stars because it is a nice product. The nipple and suction seems just right. It is really easy to clean and use. Wish it came in more color choices but am happy it's BPA free.Overall, a nice bottle with a natural soft flexible nipple.",4
4719,"We really enjoyed this product. Sometimes I need an alternative when I (the father) am by myself and need to feed the baby, and this worked out well. It did not have many of the issues I have encountered with other bottles, and the baby seemed to find this much more natural than previous items. I noted someone else stating they had an issue with durability, but we never encountered any problems related to that. In fact, we have started looking for a few more to pick up. I have not noticed issues related to spilling, or problems with the top. It also lacks problematic items that some companies make bottles from such as silicone.",5
4720,"I had never heard of Lansinoh  so I did a little research.  turns out they have been around for about 30 years and their focus is on feeding utensils that help with breastfeeding. BPA free of course. The shape of the bottle is really nice, less likely to slip in your hand.",5
4721,"I think like with most new parents you try one bottle with your newborn and then try another and another and another until you find one that meets his/her needs and yours as well.  We had used several different brands of bottles with our daughter so we started with the ones that had worked for her.  With our son we went through the typical brands:  Advent, Dr. Brown's, Tommy Tippee, and Nuk.  With the exception of the Nuk the results were the same.  He would take his formula and would ultimately have some of it dripping down his chin or out of the corner of his mouth.  He would suck on the nipple so hard that he would cause them to collapse leading to a frustrated baby.  We had tried changing the nipple to a larger size but that didn't work.  We couldn't find anything to solve our problem until we tried the Lansinoh Momma Bottle!  The nipple on the Lansinoh bottle is composed to two different types of silicone but the top portion is flexible and easy for a baby to take while the larger part of the base is made of a firmer kind of silicone that makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to cause it to collapse.  I would highly recommend giving these bottles to a new mother to try!  If you are having difficulty deciding on which brand to get for your newborn try these!",5
4722,"I have a Lansinoh pump so it's really convenient that I can pump, store and feed all from one bottle without having three different bottles and things to clean.  Our newborn took to this bottle really well!  We tried about 4-5 different bottles with her since I don't nurse and exclusively pump for her.  I just stocked up again and really glad she likes the because they are super easy to clean with the wide neck and dry quickly.",5
4723,"We tried multiple bottles and with each one our son would 'leak' and not be able to latch on properly.  When he would latch on he would end up closing some of the nipples with the suction he produced.  NOT with the NaturalWave nipples that are on these bottles.  The nipples have a softer material at the times but it gets firmer as you get to the base.  The bottles are easy to clean and you can put the cover on it and shake it without taking a bath in the formula that leaks our of some bottles.  When our niece had her baby recently, we bought her some of these as well.",5
4724,"I originally bought the OXO baby food containers.  They are square and although the plastic is sturdier and the lids seems to be on my securely, it was super hard to warm up the food in those containers.  I don't like to microwave the baby's food.  I put it in my baby bottle warmer, which only fits something round.  The square ones did not fit in.  I love these round containers as they fit into the baby food warmer with room to spare.  I can pop them out of the freezer and stick them in the food warmer and it is super convenient!  I also love how they fit 5 oz of food.  That is perfect for my 8 month old.  I bought two packages of these :) !!",5
4725,"These little containers are great! The only thing that's missing is ounce markers on the side. I also wish they came in smaller than a 12 pack since I didn't actually need 12. They fit two cubes of homemade baby food, which makes it easy to thaw food overnight and then send it to daycare.",4
4726,"These are the sun shades I wish I had bought to begin with! I originally bought others because of a better price but they didnt work as well so finally I broke down an shelled out the money for these! These are great and totally worth the price. They cover pretty much the entire window and will stretch to fit most windows. The material is just the right weight to block some sun but still allow me to see when I check my blind spot. I rarely have had any problems with the suction cups. On rare occassions (maybe once or twice a month) I will have to restick one of the suction cups, but I have never had more than one suction cup come off at the same time so they have never fallen off. If you are on the fence I would recommend you try them, I know I am happy I did!",5
4727,"When I first installed these, I was over the moon.  I loved that they stretched to fit my windows perfectly, and I loved that once I put them up, they stayed up.  They did a great job of blocking the sun, and I could still see through my back window.  I thought I'd found the Holy Grail of sunshades.We made it through fall and winter, but as spring turned to summer, the cups lost their suction completely.  I did everything:  cleaned the cups, cleaned the glass, tried drying them completely, tried leaving them just the tiniest bit damp.  In the end, it didn't matter:  they stopped sticking, and nothing I tried helped.  I'm back shopping for replacement sunshades in the hopes that they last longer than these did.",3
4728,"This shade is garbage. Within two days of installing it in my car, the shade stopped retracting so now the canvas just hangs loosely like a piece of junk. It also rattles like crazy while I'm driving. I have another style of Brica shade on the other back window and have had none of these problems. I wish I could return this shade but I threw the receipt away (bought it from Target). Waste of money.",1
4729,"I originally bought this for my newborn, once he gets transitioned into his crib. Then my 20 month old saw it, he is totally taken by it. It's probably the coolest soother I've ever seen, so I understand why he likes it so much. So I gave in, and decided that the toddler could have it, or at least use it until Baby II needs it. I played it smart and attached it to the guard rail on his toddler bed, which was probably the best idea I've ever had. I didn't even have to worry about dealing with a transition period into his big boy bed, he actually wanted to sleep there because of this soother. That alone made it worth every penny.Now about the soother, the thing is kind of bulky but what soother isn't? I can't really see the stand doing much, just because I see the thing falling over unless an adult is turning it on(then again, I didn't buy it for the stand so it does not really bother me). The mirror isn't lame, the reflection is as good as a glass mirror. Then there are little &#34;fireflies&#34; that light up behind the mirror which is about the coolest thing ever to my toddler. The white part glows different colors that change intermittently. The main ON button is easy enough for my toddler to turn on. The stars that project to the ceiling are not quite as cool as the fireflies so my toddler does not really notice them.  The other buttons are kind of weird and seems like you aren't pushing them sometimes but I'm sure that is some sort of baby/toddler deterrent. Over all I'd buy this thing again in a second, and i may just have to do that if my toddler refuses to give it up.",5
4730,"This worked out well for out double umbrella stroller in a recent trip to Disneyland. We crammed it full with stuff, yet it clung to each side well without any problems. We liked it because it was easy to attach, and small enough to avoid bulk. It is especially good with smaller umbrella strollers that are always being folded up.",5
4731,"In my opinion this chair is better than bumbo at half the cost. It can be used as a seat alone or you can have the full play tray on it which is fabulous at keeping little one entertained. I got this for my four month old.",5
4732,"The concept of this is amazing! I was so excited to give it a try. Try was all I did, however, because it was not as expected. The tray is 4 pieces that snap together and its flimsy at best. The snap together sections leave openings which pinched my daughter's arm. Also, the foam insert felt cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled by the thickness of the Bumbo but this foam part falls out and was very thin. I returned it.",2
4733,"In the two and three-quarter years I've been a mom, diaper bags have been a constant source of frustration for me.  I have at least a dozen, ranging from a fugly little backpack diaper bag that seemed like a good idea at the time but turned out to be hideous, to a really great-looking leather Nest diaper bag that is so heavy, unladen, that fully loaded it made my Chicco Cortina stroller (with baby carrier snapped in no less) pop a wheelie one time when my daughter was really little.The Skip Hop Forma Pack & Go Diaper Tote Bag is a decent balance of form and function.  It isn't the most fashionable diaper bag I have, but it isn't so heavy on its own that it isn't a drag putting useful things in it like diapers, wipes, Desitin, my purse, a bib, a few snacks, a sippy cup, a water bottle for me...  you get the picture.Even with all that stuff in the Forma Pack & Go, it isn't overwhelmingly heavy.  Everything is easy to find and reach.  The bag is functional whether the top zipper is opened or closed.  Diapers and wipes can ride in their own separate compartment.  I actually got to try the black Forma Pack & Go instead of the peacock, and I'm not embarrassed carrying this bag, even when I'm not being &#34;Mommy.&#34;  We're past the stroller stage, but the integrated stroller clips work equally (especially) well on shopping carts.  In fact, this feature is an added bonus to carrying this bag even when the kid isn't with me.I was pleasantly surprised that it can be machine washed on the gentle cycle, then air-dried.  I had salad dressing spill inside my Forma Pack & Go one day when I misguidedly put my restaurant leftover box in the bag so I wouldn't forget it.  It was a mess, but the bag cleaned up nicely.I'd definitely recommend this diaper bag.  I wish I'd found this one first.",5
4734,"I love the look of this bag. It is such a nice pop of color and people are always asking about my bag. The entire bag is easy to clean, and you could even throw the entire bag in the washing machine if you really needed to. The compartments are well thought out. The front bottom pocket fits my wallet and cell phone. The front large pocket holds two bags, one is a cooler and the other is a mesh bag perfect for extra toys, or clothes. The main pocket has a section for diapers, a  section for wipes and a couple other pockets for anything else you need to store. I always have more than enough room in this bag to hold everything. The side pockets hold bottles or cups no problem. I use them for keys or a cell phone sometimes. The best part about the stroller straps are that you can leave them fastened and then just slide them onto your stroller handles when you are on the go. The bag looks and functions great. I couldn't ask for anything more.",5
4735,"Paying $20 for a bib and for my 3rd child is very out of character for me.  But I was desperate and wanted a great quality product that actually works!  It works it works it works. I LOVE IT",5
4736,"With the latches on the seatbelt like straps fixed to click into the below the seat latches makes it easier.Still got to locate the below the seat latches and hit them.  Same with unhooking them but think with use the buttons on the latches to click will get easier to hold and unfasten.Lots of cushion and think it will hold the head better just worried about how HOT it will be during the summer.Girls loved the color and the built in cup holder is great for either a bottle or a pacifier for the younger riders and a sippy cup drink holder or toy holder for the older children.Three seating positions which is nice to have for growing children.",4
4737,"This one is DEFINITELY worth the money! It's super easy to install-even in our small sedan.  Adjusting it is also simple and it has a snug feel, but not choking or uneven like some of the other car seats we've used.  It can be rear facing, forward facing, or height adjusted for kids up to 65lbs, meaning it's the only car seat you'll ever need to buy! It's very heavy duty and well made.  The pads are soft and comfortable, but also easy to remove for spills or diaper situations.  Overall, this is an amazing seat and I will be recommending it to all my mommy friends!!",5
4738,"My wife and I bought this for our 18 month old. We wanted something that he would be able to sleep in on road trips. He seems to like it a lot, sleeps well in it and loves his cup holder. Its easy to adjust and should last a long time. This is the same price as the one at walmart, and with prime it was delivered in 2 days.... Saved paying taxes! Thanks.",5
4739,"This is a great chair. It is very easy to set up and use. It also stows away easily. The wheels are great and roll very easily on our floors. It is great to be able to tilt the seat back when bottle feeding. The seat pad is easy to remove and wash. Comes out new all the time. If it gets stained and you don't want to wash it completely then a damp warm cloth will do the job.",5
4740,"I cannot say enough good things about this high chair. I love the really secure straps that are built into this chair. I was able to comfortably put my 4 month old in this seat and let her play with some toys while I did the dishes. I knew she was very safe buckled into it. The tray is very easy to put on and take off one handed. The removable top tray is excellent! I love that I can take off that tray and wash it in the dishwasher. It is really easy to pop flat. I break it down everyday and slide it under the sofa. Even when set up it doesn't take up a ton of space. The whole seat is easy to clean. I love it!",5
4741,"This is a great highchair.  While it doesn't look as fancy as the nice woodenOxo Tot Sprout Chairthat we'd been using before, it doesn't have to look as nice, because it's small enough to store out of the way when  you're not using it.  We're able to fit it between the side of our washing machine and the wall of the laundry room, where no one has to see it.  Which is not to say that it's unattractive -- the fabric is a pleasant color, and the chair is easy enough to clean (machine washable cover!) that it doesn't look grubby with food.  Best of all, you can fold it up, and it will still stand up on its own (although you should obviously not set it out in the middle of the floor while folded up, because it is pretty easy to knock over while folded).",5
4742,"We were using another high chair in our dining room that was really bulky.  It stayed set up because it was such a hassle to fold up, and even then it didn't fold up much.This high chair has sent the other one to the closet.This came assembled right out of the box, which meant I could start using it about 10 minutes after the UPS man dropped it off.It folds up so narrowly that I can put it between the bookcase and the wall in the dining room, and it is truly out of the way.Easy to clean, easy to fold.We have a 20-month old who has no problem fitting into it, and doesn't fuss or wiggle as though uncomfortable.",5
4743,"When first thinking about buying a high chair, I wanted one of those hip, wooden ones that would look cool in my kitchen. But then I realized that my little one will probably be spending a lot of time in a high chair while I'm cooking, so I started shopping for comfort. We went to BabiesRUs to test some out. This chair stood out as the clear winner for me in terms of value, safety, overall look, and comfort. My smallish 4-month old fits in this nicely with the attached infant padding. The tray is not too high. And when I was practicing taking off  trays with one hand in the store, this one was the easiest. It also has a snack tray underneath that keeps your baby safely in the chair while you remove the larger tray. And even though I'm not a lover of things made with plastic, the chair is pretty good looking. It's not going to win any style awards, but the muted gray color and low profile make it blend in nicely with a light-colored kitchen. I don't anticipate folding it up too often, but it truly does become 'slim'. I look forward to years of use from this chair.",5
4744,"I really wanted to like this bottle. Customer service was great they emailed me twice or more about how to use the bottle which is why I put an extra star but no matter how many time I follow the instruction the bottle leaked. I love the idea of how they want the bottle to be used but it leak. Leaking my breastmilk is a no no in my book, and the bottom piece I have no idea why it's even there it just falls off.  I think maybe they need a liner like the plastic circle things blenders have at the bottom so they won't leak, or something. My problem with it is that it leaks A lot.",2
4745,"Needed a good swaddle that wouldn't be too hot in the summer.  I have previously owned other HALO swaddles.  The cotton option works well but has enough stretch to it that my babies have been able to wiggle out.  This one is stiff enough that I can wrap tight and it stays tight.  I have another brand swaddle that I use during the day because my baby wiggles out of them at night.  This is my night time swaddle because I wrap once and it stays put all night!!!",5
4746,"Halo Sleepsacks are great in general. I was looking in brick and mortar stores for a long while for a lighter weight version that would be cooler for the summer. It took me a while before I found it here. Because it uses muslin cloth, it's much cooler than the other heavy cotton versions made by Halo. I also have the muslin sleep sacks from Aden + Anais, but this Halo version works better for me. Halo has higher quality zippers. This Halo also has the velcro swaddle wrap part, which A+A does not. Although the A+A is overall cooler due to having less material, this Halo is simply the better option if you still require swaddle functionality.",5
4747,"This product is light and breathable. The velcro part is kind of chunky and there is a lot of it, but if baby is not too sensitive to pulling off sound, you should be fine. The velcro reaches pretty far, so there is no shortage for adjustment. I have a 4 month old 15 lbs baby and he fits perfectly in it. We learned how to transition out of swaddle using this product. Rotating which arm comes out each day, then both with swaddle under armpits, and then I cut off the velcro swaddle flap all together. Now I use it as a simple sleep sack.Once of the reasons why I am happier with this product than with a sleepsack from Summer Swaddleme, is because the zipper pull goes down, so you have to get zipper in from top and pull to the bottom. It is definitely well thought out detail, because it eliminats a possibility of baby sucking or biting on a metal zipper pull.",5
4748,"I bought cotton insulin sleepsack because the material might be the most suitable one for the summer. But that huge piece of Velcro... though I get the idea that it wrap the baby tightly, it's so hard! When my baby is wearing it, she feels very uncomfortable when being held upright. Finally I took that piece off.Quality is good.",3
4749,"These are great for Texas summers! The material is very breathable and the baby's arms stay put and keep him from waking himself up. I love that the zipper opens at the bottom which make it easy to check the diaper or just let his feet hang out. I have 3 of these - two in muslin and one regular cotton, which is a little warmer.",5
4750,"Definitely a must for kids and parents on the go.  I love my Clek Foonf but wanted a cup holder so was thrilled when I found that you could buy this accessory.",5
4751,"I wish there would be more accessories for the Foonf. But Im happy FINALLY the released these cup holders, they work and you can choose which side to install it.",5
4752,"My god daughter O is 3 months old and she loves motion. Car rides, rocking, bouncing are all things she enjoys. While her mom has the Boppy I thought this would be perfect for my house since she loves motion. I was right. The minute I put her on the pillow she began smiling. She loves it!. She likes laying on it, sitting on it and feeding on it.The difference from the Boppy and Mombo? Boppy is softer, no vibration and more flexible. Fitting and staying better on plus size moms and larger dads. I'm a size 24 and although this fit around me it fit barely and didn't want to stay put. Lucky I didn't buy it for feeding but for tummy time and for face to face interaction so I could show her some baby signs. My husband is a big muscular guy he is 5&#34;11' and 225lbs. This pillow just makes that and also has issues staying but is a bit better with him.I think this pillow is perfect if you are a size 22 and smaller. The vibration is smoothing. There is a firmer side and a softer side. If you have any doubts about sizing I say try it out in the store.",4
4753,"Our baby loves using this pillow for tummy time. I was told that tummy time is really important for the baby. Basically, our girl would lay on her belly while one of us supervises the baby. I have read something along the line that because babies sleep on their back to help prevent sudden infant death syndrome, they need to spend some of awake time on their stomach to develop physically and mentally. We like that this pillow give a lot of support both for tummy time and sitting time. I also use it to nurse the baby. It helps support the weight of the baby to give mommy an easier time. I would recommend this pillow to all new moms!",5
4754,"Having owned at least two bobbies over the last few years, my wife reported this works just as well if you accept that it is different that a bobby.  Bobby's are soft and cushy and pliable.  This has a much narrower opening and is more rigid.",5
4755,"This is a great nursing pillow- it's plush yet firm, and spit up wipes off easily :) I especially love the classic gender neutral pattern.The issue that I have with it though, is that because it's so firm and the gap so small, I can't use it in the traditional way a nursing pillow is used (which is not the pillows fault by any means.)I have used a boppy, which has more 'give' however it isn't as firm as this one. The mombo deluxe also comes with a vibrating feature which I haven't used but looks like a great option to have.(it's crazy how these baby accoutrements get fancier as the years go by!)With that said, when I am on the couch or glider, I can curl up and still use the pillow on one side.  Baby is usually conked out before we can get to the other one anyway :)",4
4756,"From my wife's point of view:If you need a breastfeeding pillow, this Mombo pillow works. It works really well supporting the baby. Meaning that my baby's weight doesn't smash the material down when feeding. It has a firm frame shape that hasn't changed. The pillow has not flattened over time. It has a soft cover (softest of my nursing pillows) that I love. The cover is machine washable. It also does a good job of supporting my son when propping him up.I would not be considered a thin woman nor am I plus sized. I would say I'm average size, with some pregnancy pounds still left to lose. This pillow has a narrow opening. I assume the reason being so that you don't need a strap to keep it attached to your body. In that sense the narrow opening works perfectly. It actually stays in place better than my Boppy nursing pillow that has a strap (although I never use the strap because I find it annoying). The problem having the narrow opening is that because of my wider size, I can not easily put this pillow around my body with one hand. Anyone about to breastfeed a baby, normally has the baby in their arms. So trying to shove this pillow around my waist one handed is tricky.I don't find the firmer side of the pillow more useful for feeding. It feels just like it is a slightly firmer piece of foam. My son does not seem to care for the vibration unit one way or the other. Although it is very easy to turn on and off. You just simply press on the center of the pillow where the vibration unit is located. In fact there have been times I have accidentally turned it on or off. I don't find this pillow to be long enough. Wide enough, yes. Long enough, no. My son is now 5 months old and over 27&#34; long. Yes he is larger for his age. His feet hang off the Mombo pillow when breastfeeding, which is a distraction for him.As a breast feeding pillow, the Mombo works. I just didn't find the shape to work well for me or my baby. If you are thinner it will be easier to get the narrow opening around your waist. If your baby is an infant or on the smaller size they will fit the shape better than a longer baby. The vibration unit didn't add much value for me. It does work well for tummy time but not so much for breast feeding.",3
4757,"I'd used the Boppy breastfeeding pillow when I nursed my first child and I literally couldn't have breastfed without it.  This pillow offers the same support as the Boppy with some minor improvements.  First, I liked that this pillow was flat instead of rounded.  I found that with the Boppy, the baby would always roll sideways.  However, the flat design of this pillow helps avoid that problem.  The vibrating unit is also a plus.  The vibration isn't too strong and it is a nice addition to helping the baby sleep.  The colorful elephants on the pillow cover are cute and nicely gender neutral.  Overall, definitely a good help for a breastfeeding mother.",4
4758,"I love this little pillow. It takes a lot of the burden off your shoulder muscles while nursing your baby. As someone who has Fibromyalgia, that is such a huge relief. The vibration is perfect and soothing to the baby and is especially helpful for colicky babies. I also love that as the baby gets older it can be used to help prop the baby up into a sitting position.The only negative is the price. Really, why is baby stuff so expensive?",4
4759,"What I like about this nursing pillow.  The removable washable cover and the adorable print.  It's also nice for propping up a  little one.  It's a relatively supportive pillow.What I don't like.  The firmer side for nursing.  I actually prefer to use the softer side for breastfeeding.  I think adding that extra layer of firmness was unnecessary.  Even worse, it makes the pillow too stiff to easily adjust the opening.  I can understand the complaints from some reviewers about this seeming too tight.  My skinny 10-year-old girl with a 23-inch waist can stand up with this around her waist, and it stays in place without her holding on.  So, yes it's on the snugish side.  I actually would flat out not recommend it for a plus sized mother, and even others may find it too tight.The vibrating feature isn't something I'm interested in using.So overall, I'm happy enough with this pillow as it was free in exchange for a review, but with the stiffness and difficulty adjusting the opening, I would probably be returning it for a refund and trying something else.",4
4760,"When my daughter was a baby, I used a bed pillow or arm rest to assist in nursing, so receiving the Comfort & Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow was quite a thrill.  For this next generation, it's a welcome development which is not only attractive, but truly comfortable for baby, mommy, or any individual who is feeding a baby or supervising her/him.  The little video included in Amazon's listing is worth watching to get an idea of its functions, but I'd also recommend checking this out in a store to be sure you like it.  With a softer/firmer side option and the removable vibration disk, this is a nice option, and the removable cover which can be washed is a definite plus.  Our only problem in this home is that our little dog wants a pillow like this, so we must be careful that she doesn't take it over from baby.  I was expecting a pillow to be not much larger than a neck pillow, so it was a wonderful surprise to see it is much larger and more substantial.  It is sealed in a plastic and lightweight cardboard package, so if you're gifting the pillow and wanting to wrap it, be prepared to either have a soft package or you'&#314;l need a box in which to put it.  Unless we're intending to use the vibration option, we keep it out of the pillow.",5
4761,"I thought the pillow was really cute, and I liked that it had a soft side and hard side, but ultimately I prefer my Boppy. I am a larger lady (22/24), and it didn't fit around my waist comfortably. The baby didn't mind it for nursing on, but he didn't like laying on it for play time. Not sure how useful the vibration is -- I never used it.",3
4762,"The pillow is nice and firm.  For me, it was the right height.  I like how the sides cut in because it allows use in a narrow chair.  Every person is different, so it may be worth trying one first to make sure the size, height, cut all work for you.  The vibrating insert is a little weird in my opinion.  What baby isn't happy while eating?  The vibration really isn't necessary.  Kind of a gimmick add-on in my opinion.",4
4763,"This nursing pillow blew me away. It's so plush and has many uses - it's great for nursing, but also for letting the baby prop against it while I'm trying to put on makeup or clean. I also love the elephant pattern. I highly recommend buying this!",5
4764,"I realize I am in the minority here, but I really did not like this pillow. I know it is supposed to sit right under your chest for breastfeeding, but I found it to still be WAY too tight to wear comfortably. (For reference, I weighed 135 before pregnancy and gained 35 pounds. I'm only two weeks postpartum, but I still don't consider myself to be exceptionally large at this point.)I do like that there is the option to turn the pillow upside down and use it to sit Baby up, though we haven't used much of that side yet. And the optional vibration is also an interesting feature, though, again, my baby isn't that interested in it yet.Overall, and especially for the price, I'm not terribly impressed with this pillow. If I can't comfortably use it for breastfeeding, then what's the point? I'd rather use myBoppy Pillow with Slipcover, Peaceful JungleorMy Brest Friend Original Pillow, Fireworkspillows. At least they fit around me.",2
4765,"I could go on and on about this one.  It ROCKS.  It can be used while nursing, but also in the sitting-up-stages.  The two sides of it have different &#34;feel.'  One is firmer.  How ingenious is that!!!  This is just the cutest little elephant print ever, and is soft to the touch.  Much larger and nicer than I anticipated, too!!!Also, I did NOT note that it came with a little motion option!  (There's a vibrating attachment.)Comfort for baby and mommy.  Highly recommended!!!Note: Covers for this are available for purchase.  I recommend those as well.",5
4766,"This pillow makes an impressive presentation. The vibrating orb (that you place inside the pillow) is actually separated and highlighted in a way that makes the overall package appear quite substantial-an excellent gift! The print theme/colors are neutral and SO cute...You simply unzip the cover and place the vibrating orb (takes 1 &#34;C&#34; battery) inside the hole in the pillow after turning it on. I love that you can feel the vibrations through both sides of the pillow equally well.I also love that this Mombo Deluxe pillow is big enough to offer the support I want, but isn't cumbersome to use. I still feel like I have plenty of control and that it's a help instead of a hinderance. Bonus use for the firm side of the pillow: It makes an excellent head/neck support for me while lying on the bed or floor. Less tossing and turning makes the most out of limited sleep.I prefer the soft elephant side for nursing (more supportive than a pillow). Since this side also has a tubular inner edge that may be irritating, I recommend using the firmer side for propping-up baby on the floor. This is an excellent option for us, since it seems like a good way to accommodate the curiosity of siblings without constantly worrying about if he/she is holding baby the right way all the time...",5
4767,"I would not hesitate to recommend the Mombo to new mothers. It snugs up to you and helps support baby while you are nursing; it can also be used on the floor to help baby &#34;lounge,&#34; have &#34;tummy time,&#34; or sit up. It's worth the initial investment because you'll use it over the long-term. Our boppy turned into a comfort item for our toddler and she would take her bottle and lounge against the boppy on her own for quiet time.In terms of price, it's basically a souped-up boppy. It does have the vibrating feature, which you can remove. (I don't think it's needed.) You will have to supply your own battery if you want to use it.You may want to get a cover, which will run you another $10 or so. The original fabric is adorable, but you'll want to treat any stains immediately.Recently I also reviewed the Born Free Bliss pillow, which I felt was too large. It was awkward both to use and store. In contrast, the Mombo (or boppy) will fit you and your baby comfortably---for now and for months to come.",5
4768,"Excellent for grandparents/babysitters!This is a wonderful, if not necessary purchase for anyone who cares for an infant, whether nursing or not. I got this pillow for my baby grandson to use when he visits. It's adorable, well-made, soft but supportive, and versatile.I use it for comfort and support while bottle feeding him, and it makes his tummy time more comfortable, as he has an easier time looking around.  It's also been great for propping the little guy up while I'm tasking;  he's content and relaxed in it. We've used the vibrational feature and it seems to soothe him, but he's otherwise happy without it so far.I feel this is a must-have for anyone with a little one in their home! Highly recommended!",5
4769,"I believe the Comfort & Harmony Mombo pillow is well-made. I like the size and softness of the pillow. The outer part of the arms are slightly indented to fit between me and the glider armrest better. I have not used the vibrating mechanism but I could see how this would help rock a baby to sleep. The slipcover washes easily and the price is similar to the Boppy. I also love the elephant print as it coordinated with my son's animal-themed room.",5
4770,"Nursing pillows are really great to have, they are a total back saver!  I have tried other kinds, but I really like the design of this one.  It's firmer than others I have tried and not as round.  The angles make it easier to balance the baby and accessories on the pillow.  I prop her up in the pillow so she won't roll off the couch and this works well for that too.  The vibrator is nice addition and isn't as rough as I feared it would be.  She does prefer to sleep with it off.Just an added bonus to note-The pillow's design is cute and I don't mind leaving it around on the couch because it doesn't clash with anything.",5
4771,"With my previous two babies I used a different style nursing pillow (rhymes with hoppy). I was fairly pleased with it, but I think the Mombo is an improvement over my previous pillow. It has two sides - one firm and one plush. I use the firm side for nursing. It was very useful for getting the baby properly positioned (without me having to twist around or bend over).The cover is removable and washable (which is nice, since it has already been spit-up on numerous times in the last week.)My one complaint is that the vibrating feature does not have an on/off switch on the actual vibrating unit itself. It's convenient to be able to just push on the pillow to turn it on, but on more than one occasion the vibration has inadvertently turned on while we were traveling or moving it. There is a timer on it, so the vibration won't run perpetually, but it would be nice if there was an actual on/off switch that you could toggle on/off for when you won't be needing the vibration so it doesn't turn on accidentally.",4
4772,"The Comfort & Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow is adorable and quite helpful. The vibrating unit is a nice addition, especially for a fussy little one. It boasts two sides: Firm and soft, one for nursing and one for reclining. The coverlet is pretty and unisex (elephants in green); the extra covers are varied for many tastes...it will be hard not to buy them all...do buy extras, though, they do get soiled easily.",5
4773,"This pillow is great. Firm on one side, but softer on the other. Can be used not only for supporting your nursing baby, but also to prop up your baby while she lays against the pillow by herself. Decorated with sweet elephants, this design can be for boys or girls. The comfort of this pillow is great. It's very durable too. Comes with a vibrating disc that can be removed if you don't want to use it, but slips into the pillow to sooth your sweet baby if you want to use it. This is a large pillow, so this will be used for several months ahead!",5
4774,"Our other pillow is from NursingPillow.com and our only basis for comparison. They're almost polar opposites.The Mombo is much firmer and taller than the NursingPillow. This comes in handy for its intended purpose. Mombo brings the baby closer to Mommy and Baby doesn't slowly sink into the pillow away from Mommy. Neither side seems uncomfortable to Baby, but firm side up seems to be more comfortable for Mommy. Mommy cannot use the NursingPillow as effectively.The Mombo is heavier and more resilient. Heavier means it shifts less when Baby fidgets. Resilience, like a rubber band, makes the Mombo &#34;grip&#34; Mommy's waist better than NursingPillow.The Mombo is bigger and has more area to plant Baby.The vibration feature on the Mombo doesn't seem to make a difference either way.The Mombo can double as an armchair for Baby when you place it on the floor, firm side down.The NursingPillow is very comfortable and soft and works very well as a neck-pillow for Mommy and Baby. I can also scrunch the NursingPillow into the baby carrier to protect Baby's head. The Mombo cannot be scrunched.But in the end, it will come down to personal preference and anatomical differences. I can only conclusively say, it works well for us.",4
4775,"This pillow is big and comfy and such a cute pattern. I love that it's firm on one side and soft on the other. The vibrations might be a gimmick, but could be a really neat feature. I'm glad to have the option and think this will be a really item in many ways!",5
4776,"Pros:Comes with slipcover that is machine washable. (instead of the hidden cost of having to buy one separately like some other ones)Holds it's shape well.Harder on one side (for nursing), softer on the other if baby is using it as cushion.Cons:It may be a little small but I think it's supposed to be very snug so it stays on the mom. It is something to think about before buying.Neutral:The vibration unit. I just don't know...",4
4777,"The Mombo Deluxe has proven to be an invaluable tool when it comes to feeding the baby (either nursing or bottle feeding).  Back and shoulder pain from prolonged feedings have been greatly reduced thanks to the support it provides.  Because it has a firm side (the soft side seems to be very comfortable for the baby to rest against), the pillow has been an effective tool in allowing the baby to be propped upright for proper digestion after feedings and for napping.  The vibration option (you do have to provide your own battery) has been effective; we&#8217;ve noticed a difference when we don&#8217;t use it, as it seems to have a calming effect.  As the baby gets older and begins to sit, this pillow will also be able to provide great support and protection from possible tumbles.  Aesthetically, the design of our pillow is very pleasing and gender-neutral (sage green and white, with elephants of varying colors).  The material is very easy to clean as long as you wipe it up quickly (purchasing a cover might make the most sense if you&#8217;re having to clean it often).",4
4778,"There are several things that I really like about this pillow!  One, the soft vibrations from a removable device soothes our baby; two, the WASHABLE double-sided cover allows for easy removal and cleaning; and three, multiple uses.  While the pillow is advertized as a nursing pillow it can be used for so much more.This pillow can be used as your baby grows!  We used it when we started introducing tummy time and the little elephants were a hit! As our baby started to grow, he loved being able to sit up in it and it provided some support for his little back.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is have a baby if they are nursing their baby or not.  I found it helped with bottle feeding and providing that closeness and bonding time that I love!",5
4779,"We have long been fans of wearable blankets for our kids and these are the newest and best iteration of the concept. While keeping our almost one year-old covered throughout the night no matter how much he squirms and moves, it is also snug along his sides, which seems to offer him more security and comfort while still leaving his arms free to move. The material has grown softer with each successive wash and has just the right thickness to keep him warm without over-heating him.The double zipper is also a brilliant idea. We often put essential oils on our kids' feet at night and having a second zipper providing access to our baby's feet without unzipping him entirely makes this a simple process. One caveat, however, is that by having such a long zipper it can be difficult to zip a squirmy child.We would happily buy these for future kids.",5
4780,"Love this butterfly pattern- very stylish, yet still girly, and it is soft! The design is SO wonderful ! 2 way zippers mean that no matter where you are changing your child in the middle of the night, it is EASY to unzip and get to their diaper! No fumbling, trying to remember which side the zipper is on when you're 3/4 asleep still! And the zipper is covered with fabric, so no pulling on it by baby! I love that it actually covers your child's upper arms too, to help keep drafts from hitting their bodies! Only washed a couple of times, but seems to be holding up very well. This is a great baby shower present and I would recommend getting the small versus newborn, as newborns still need to be swaddled as much as possible, and I think this would be a great transitional piece from swaddling!",5
4781,"Adorable little blanket / pouch.  Very easy to unzip and rezip, with easy infant access.The polka design is subtle.",5
4782,"This is a great product for babies. You're not supposed to put blankets in with babies in cribs because of suffocation risk, and this is a great way to give the babies the comfortable feel of a blanket but it's safe. It has sleeves and is like an outfit but the way the fabric fans out makes it feel like a blanket  It's soft and not too thin; it feels well-made. The print is very pretty. We have gotten several of these in different colors and sizes. A wonderful, safe alternative to a blanket.",5
4783,"I just adore this cuddly, cozy lightweight summertime blanket.  It's 100% cotton, very similar to onesies, and soft and comfortable.  The floral pattern looks like an assortment of pretty in pink mandalas with a touch of gray and orange her and there.  It has a very summerish looking quality to it.The ComfortMe is perfect for summertime when it's just cool enough to need a bit of covering, but not an extra layer of clothing or a heavier blanket.  It's almost like a poncho in that the arms are open and, if wanted or needed, the bottom can be left open.  I do like the fact that there are different stages of blankets that can be used from the newborn to the one-year-old.SwaddlePod:  (5 to 10 pounds) ""Recreate the comfort of the womb.""SwaddleMe:  (7  to 20 pounds)  ""Easiest way to Swaddle for safe and sound sleep.""WrapSack:  (7 to 10 pounds) ""Transitioning swaddle, arms in or out.""ComfortMe:  (12 to 24 pounds)  ""Keeps baby warm, and replaces loose blankets in crib.""These all come in an assortment of colors and designs so you can customize your SwaddleMe wardrobe (if you click the links you can see these throughout the page).  You can select different sizes as well.  The quality is high and most certainly can be used as a hand-me-down.",5
4784,"It is lightweight 100% cotton and is great for the summer months to add an extra layer for when the air conditioning is on. It is not too heavy, not too lightWe love the Pink, gray, and orange floral spiral pattern.It is a great feature that the blanket zips from both the top and the bottom. The bottom zipper makes middle of the night diaper changes a breeze. It has a snap and small flap of fabric at the top to cover the zipper for the baby's comfort. The neck opening could be a little larger, as our 6 month old has lots of fat rolls and there isn't much extra room.Our baby immediately rolls to her stomach when put down so there is no way to keep her on her back (our pediatrician states this is fine as long as baby does it on her own). We like that the zipper is off to the side instead of directly in the middle so when she does sleep on her belly, all her weight is not directly on the zipper.Overall, my wife and I are happy with this.",4
4785,"Now that our little one is starting to roll, we have started to move away from the swaddling products for her to sleep in.  The wearable blanket is a great transition for this.  It is made of 100% cotton to keep her warm but not overheated while sleeping.  She loves being put in this (when she isn&#8217;t completely resisting a nap of course).  She sleeps soundly and comfortably.  We usually have the A/C on most of the Spring, Summer, and early Fall so I wish that it had longer &#8220;sleeves&#8221; to the product to keep her arms warm as they can get cold sometimes as she sleeps, but she tends to like the movability.  It is VERY easy to take on and off and washes up very nicely in the washing machine.  Not to mention the pink flower and butterfly print is super cute.  Great product!",4
4786,"I love the soft lightweight 100% cotton (unfortunately made in China). This is the perfect wearable blanket for summer months. It looks a it like a kimono- large arm area and full, comfortable fit.The zipper at the bottom allows your baby to stay blanketed while changing a diaper.The Large is a big wrap, big enough for a 18- 24 pound baby. I love that it is a soft blanket that never falls off.",5
4787,"I've used a similarly designed sleeper with my son, but the zipper was in the front and the material was better suited for cold months.This design, with the bottom zipper and lighter material, is a big improvement, and a much better choice for warm weather. No worrying about an accidental sweat rash.Love the pink print too.",5
4788,"This is pretty much your typical lightweight wearable blanket with one difference. The difference is that it has partial sleeve like coverings.  I loved this product because it it allows for a little more coverage to keep the baby's arms warm. It has the zipper on the bottom of the sack, so it is simple to perform diaper changes. Overall, a good product which appears to be one of a kind so far.",5
4789,"I like the idea and overall design of this wearable blanket, but it has one significant flaw.  The arm holes are very small.  We use fleece 'sleep sacks' over the winter, and the lighter design of this wearable blanket is nice for the summer season.  The arm holes are sewn shut on the lower part of the hole.  It seems like they should have just left the opening large, or even added a snap.I chose to try the 'large' size, despite my twins being 19 lbs and 22 lbs, and they didn't like the restriction on their arms, and it was hard for me to feed their arms through the holes too!  For smaller infants, this might be a good solution.  My kids are 14 months old, and a bit small for their age as twins.  For singleton babies, I would guess most of them could use this up to size 6 months or so, despite the advertised size chart.  Large is designed for 9-12 months, 18-24 lbs.",3
4790,"Like many other reviewers, I like this blanket for its ability to keep little one warm especially they're ones that likes to around and kick their blankets.  When they are small it's less of an issue which is why would be great they came in larger sizes.We have used the halo, ergo, and others.  While they all have some benefits sometimes I still prefer the simplicity and ease of care and value you from a basic swaddle blanket",4
4791,"We use a lot of wearable blankets for our infant because we follow the advice not to include loose blankets in the crib.  One of the downsides of most wearable blanket designs is that they are sleeveless.  In cooler weather, this requires dressing baby in a long-sleeved shirt or pajama top underneath the wearable blanket, which adds more complication (and more laundry!).  The design of this wearable blanket provides long-sleeve coverage for the arms without restricting movement.  It seems to provide a sleeping experience that is more similar to sleeping under a real blanket.",5
4792,"This is a great sleep sack as the weather gets warmer! Our son is 7 months old and we live in the southwest and it is starting to get much warmer (~June). These sleep sacks have a simple zipper that goes from the left shoulder all the way to the bottom right. This makes it incredibly easy to get the baby in and out. The sacks are machine washable and dryable so that also is a great convenience!",5
4793,"I absolutely love the Bees Knees pattern on this blanket. It's adorable not to mention gender neutral. This product is made with large arm holes so your baby doesn't get too hot while they sleep. This company makes it convenient for diaper changes with a zipper at the bottom of it. It's very easy to wrap your baby up in this blanket. I think its great that the small will work for 3-9 months so it means you get to purchase less blankets. Very happy with this item!",5
4794,"My daughter is tiny for her age and we still use sleep sacks or wearable blankets for her every night. Putting on the garment is as much a part of her routine as prayers, story time and a little bit of milk. I was excited to receive this product but very disappointed once I used it. The sleeves are non functioning. It felt like I was putting my child in a strait jacket. The arm holes were not well thought out. Overall just disappointed.",1
4795,"With our daugher, now a little over 2, there was that awkward phase where she wouldn't stay swaddled, pulling out one way or another but she wouldn't stay under a blanket.  I looked around at the time for something that could stay secure and didn't find anything. With another one on the way in August, I saw this and had to have a closer look.Let me say, this fits the bill exactly.  Your child will stay warm and won't have any way or need to wiggle out of this. It's like a swaddle in texture and thickness but made for older babies or wiggly ones or ones that don't, for whatever reason, want to be swaddled.I'm very pleased as it fits the exact niche we were needing to fill.",5
4796,"This is wonderful, the material is very soft and following the instructions it was very easy to use. Washed very well. The fabric is very light so perfect for a spring/fall usage in addition to summer.",4
4797,"There are several things that I like about the Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket.  First of all, it has sleeves, many of the blankets that we had used with our daughter were sleeveless.  This blanket has arm holes, which although could be improved, have allowed us to wrap our baby up and still restrict his arm movements while he is sleeping.  The design that I ordered, Sketchy Safari, is attractive and soft.  If you are looking for a wearable blanket to use this summer, try this one!",4
4798,"I picked these up as my sister just had a baby and she lives in a cold area where it snows. She was very happy with how well these fit and how they allow room for her baby to move around. This is such a great item if you worried about trying to keep your little one snuggled up and warm.A really great gift for a mom-to-be.",4

4800,"This is a great product. It is vital not to put your child in a blanket (or have anything else for that matter) in the crib. It puts them at risk for suffocation and also increases the risk of SIDS. But of course you want your infant to be as comfortable as possible. This is a great way to give your child the comfortable feeling of a blanket but have it be safe for the child. Its exactly as it says ... a wearable blanket. It looks like a blanket on the outside, but on the inside it has partitions to there are sleeves and its like an outfit, not like a blanket.The product seemed very well made. It was very soft. It was made of 100% cotton, which I like. The pattern was cute, and I know they have many different patterns/sizes and also different ones for the cold and warm months.Of course make sure to follow all directions and that it fits as it should for it to be safe for the baby. There is a warning label in it about that that you should read.I would recommend this product. Its a great way to give your child the comfort of a blanket in a safe way.",5
4801,"I love this Wearable Blanket.  Since you can't give babies a blanket, this is the next best thing.  It makes it easy for moms to change diapers in the middle of the night and gives the assurance that the baby is safe from blankets but still warm.  I love the way it snugs the baby and is so cozy.  Perfect with a long sleeved onesie for cooler nights.  I like giving these as baby shower gifts since new moms don't realize how amazing they are!",5
4802,"We have four kids and so far the only brand we've used were the Halo Sleepsacks, which we've been happy with. I got a few of these to try out, and they compare well, better in some ways, less so in others. I really think you can't go wrong with either, so I would buy one or the other to try it out and see if you like it.  If not, return it and get the brand.I think the Halo sleep sacks are softer. This could be because ours have been washed many times, but to try and even the odds I put these in with every laundry load I did for a week, and while they did soften, I still found the Halo softer. It's soft enough, but if you had a baby with really sensitive skin you might prefer the Halo.I found the overall quality of the Summer to be a tad better than the Halo. The zippers seem studier, they are easier to work one-handed, and I like that it has sleeves. Overall it's a good option and I think the choice between this and Halo would really come down to individual preferences. I think they are both good products.  I like the pattern on this one better than some of the other options from Summer, though since the baby doesn't care, I'm not too concerned with what it looks like.",4
4803,"I like the idea and overall design of this wearable blanket, but it has one significant flaw.  The arm holes are very small.

Covers arms and stays in place, yet with enough room for airflow, not too constricting. Swaddling configuration for those who prefer this sleep mode. Wearable design prevents baby from squirming out of it, but still allows for some motion. Good construction.Four different configurations for different stages of development. Easy to use, easy to clean.",5
4805,"Ok, my favorite thing about this wearable blanket is that it makes my son look like a teeny little Jedi. So cute! Otherwise, I've been happy with it. I had to stop using it for a bit because of a need to go back to swaddling, but we're just about ready to try using it again. One star deducted because I'm pretty sure it shrunk the first time I washed it.",4
4806,"Wearable blankets are great for toddlers who have outgrown swaddling but would kick off regular blankets or should still avoid them. I give this four stars because I like this about as well as the other two brands we own - but it's not clearly the best, so as to earn five stars.I prefer cotton, and this jersey is a good medium weight for some added warmth over pj's. The loose sleeves on this are nice to have and help to keep arms a bit warmer. The two-way zipper is good, but because it doesn't open at the top I don't find it more convenient than a reverse zipper; you have to find the tab and remember which way to zip for diaper change (up) verses blanket removal (down.) Also, Summer Infant's zips along the side and bottom rather than down the front. I imagine this might be convenient for a younger baby lying down, but I find it's a little harder to put on our toddler, who's usually sitting on my lap. Sizing seems accurate; large is supposed to fit infants 18-24 lbs and our 22 lb child fits but does seem near the size limit.For comparison, we also use a muslin aden+anais sleeping bag (single layer, lighter weight) and a Halo sleepsack (in cotton similar to ComfortMe.) It may be helpful to note that for the other brands, size medium fits up to 24 lbs and is comparable to ComfortMe large. All three work well for us. The main difference is since we have the light weight single-layer style from aden+anais, I use that over slightly thicker pajamas. The ComfortMe is great with short sleeve pajamas since it's got a bit of sleeve so arms don't get chilled. Between the three I say it largely comes down to preference.",4
4807,"I absolutely love this blanket! We have some of the sleep sacks but my two biggest complaints are that they're sleeveless and that although they zip up from the bottom, the vertical zipper merely creates a slit in the bottom of the blanket and you have to basically &#34;undress&#34; baby from the sleep sack in order to do a diaper change. In the middle of the night when you're trying to accomplish this without waking baby it proves to be rather difficult.This wearable blanket's zipper runs along the bottom seam which allows you to actually open up the blanket without disturbing your baby. I can finally do diaper changes in the middle of the night without waking my son! I also love the sleeves because although my son tends to be on the warm side, his little arms stay pretty cool and the loose covering of this wearable blanket provides just the right amount of warmth. We're extremely happy with this product and highly recommend it!",5
4808,"OK, it really is kind of a Snuggie for babies. But on an infant, the little arm covers remind me of angel wings, and everyone says they're adorable.And seriously, those grow-up Snuggies are probably cozy and lovely if I could just get past how silly they look. Since this baby version doesn't suffer that flaw, it gets five stars from me!Love the two-way, covered zipper, so you can open whichever part you need, and never worry about the zipper catching skin.This was definitely an appreciated adoption-shower gift, and now that I've seen it in action and talked with the new mom about it, I can't even come up with a &#34;con&#34; to post. So there's no Pro/Con list this time, just five shining stars! :)",5
4809,"We love these kick mats especially since our kid loves to put his foot against the back of the chair. It helps to keep the back of our seats from turning black.  Looks like it works as intended so far.",5
4810,"These are really great for the back of seats. With kids sitting behind you, they are constantly putting their feet up or dribbling junk all over the back of seats. One time, my son decided to use the back of a leather seat to draw with markers. Yuk.These are really nicely made with great stitching, thick, durable material and solid straps. There are two straps, one to go around the headrest and one for the base of your seat. The material is wipeable and thick and will withstand even the messiest of kiddos.A nicely made product that will pay for itself very quickly in ease of use and protection for your car. They may be a little pricy in comparison but if they hold up longer, it is better than buying two sets of cheaply made products. I was provided a sample for testing and review.",5
4811,"I received this in exchange for writing a review.1. This definitely provides protection against my 3 year 5 month old granddaughter kicking the seat she is in back of. However, if you look on Amazon you will see comparable products that cost much less.2. I could not get this to fit nice and smooth as shown in the picture, though that does not affect the protection afforded.3. This has two sets of adjustable straps on the top and bottom. For each set of straps only side is adjustable in terms of length; the other side is fixed. That proved to be a bit of a nuisance for attaching the bottom straps. It would have been much easier if both sides had been adjustable.Bottom line: This works, though there are cheaper alternatives.",3
4812,"This monitor for the most part works just fine but the biggest complaint that I have is that the battery life stink on it.  I am lucky if I can get 4 hours out of it.  By the time my baby goes to bed I still have several hours that I am awake and moving around the house getting things done.  I need a monitor that lasts longer than 4 hours.  I don't understand why something that costs 150 dollars contains such a crappy battery!",3
4813,"I love this baby monitor.  I can compare this one to the Motorola MBP36 and I like this one better because the video quality is so much better on this one.  I thought the MBP36 was good until I got this one, then it was absolutely no contest.  In fact, I wish I could return the MBP36.  The MBP36 is good because you can pan the camera remotely using the controls on the monitor and I like that the buttons on the monitor is on the face and not on the edges because that makes it so you are not constantly accidentally pushing buttons when you're carrying it, but that's it.  In video quality, this one wins hands down and since that's the most important part - I prefer this one.  The wide angle is nice because you can see a greater area, but then you're not getting a close up.  There's a zoom feature which kind of makes up for it but if you are only using this to point into one specific area and want to see like your baby breathing - you may want to get the non-wide  angle version of this baby monitor.  This one is great if you want to monitor the whole crib or a whole room.  If your baby is very mobile, this would be your best choice.  The camera is static (doesn't pan), but you won't need it to because you can set it up so it shows you the whole room at once.What could be improved:1. Battery life of the monitor - it only lasts a few hours of continuous use.  The charger does have an extra long cable, but it would be nice if the battery life was better.2.  The buttons are all along the edges of the monitor - this is nice because you get a very nice big viewing screen, but not so nice because you're constantly accidentally hitting buttons on the thing when you're carring it around.3.  Picture quality - Yes, it's much better video quality than the Motorola MBP36 and it's good enough that you can easily see your baby breathing, but it could always be better....if we're being greedy.What is great:1.  Great wide screen so you can see an entire room in one shot.  You don't need it to pan.  Screen size is bigger and better than the MBP362.  Great video quality - you can easily watch your baby breathing3.  Great night vision  - you can easily watch baby breathing4.  Very reliable5.  Excellent portability - I have a 1500 sq ft house on a half acre lot and I'm able to monitor the baby from pretty much my entire property.  So everywhere in the house and out in the yard as well.  Excellent.  It beats the Motorola MBP36 in this area as well.6.  Has an internal antenna which is way nicer than the externa antenna of the Motorola MBP36 - while still having better connection.7.  The stand is better and sturdier on the monitor than the MBP368.  Pretty much everything you need to monitor your baby.9.  The monitor and camera can be closer together before you get feedback - basically, just as long as they are at least 2 feet apart, you won't have feedback issues.  Not like the MBP36 which gets feedback if they are in the same room.  This is especially important if you're trying to adjust the placement of the camera while looking at the monitor.  Or - if you rig this up in your car to use as a car baby monitor (which I did).  I would recommend using the non-wide screen version if using in the car, but this one would work as well.  I love using this in the car because 1.  It's way better than trying to rig up a bunch of mirrors to monitor my baby in her rear facing car seat.  2.  You can't see the baby with mirrors if driving at night - but you can with this monitor because of the night vision.  3.  With the zoom feature, you can easily see baby breathing in her car seat - this is especially important with the rise in incidents where babies stop breathing in their car seats.  I am able to drive with confidence and not have to worry because I can totally see her face and chest and know everything is okay.  I have the monitor mounted on my dash with a GPS monitor that accepts a 5&#34; screen.10.  Durability - I've been using this in all different capacities, every day for the past 2 months and it's been going strong.  I've dropped the monitor a few times and it's gotten scuffed on the edges, but still working great.Great product that I use on a daily basis and am extremely happy with.",5
4814,"My younger sister just had her first baby.  She said she has a hard time calming her down to go to sleep, she always seems to want to be held.  I went out to see her and the new baby soon after she was born and took this with me.  I saw what she was talking about when she tried to put her down for a nap.I got this out, we read the instructions and got to business.  We put it on the baby which was really easy to do and only took a couple of minutes to do.  My sister put her back in her bassinette and what do ya know... she went right to sleep!I was just floored.  I have a 15 year old who was an extremely difficult baby who cried constantly.  I remember trying to swaddle him in a receiving blanket like I was shown during a baby care class when I was pregnant and it NEVER worked, he always got out of it.  I think if they had something like this back then both my son and I would have gotten a lot more sleep!My sister says she uses it (I left it with her when I came home) every time the baby lays down and it's working like a charm and the baby is sleeping very well!",5
4815,"This WrapSack blanket is really easy to use which I love. It doesn't take a lot of time or effort to bundle your baby up in this. This product is extremely soft and comes in a cute pattern. One of the best things about this is there is a zipper at the bottom for diaper changes which is very convenient. I also love the sizing range on these as the small fits from 7-14 lbs so your baby can use it for a few months before growing out of it.",5
4816,"This swaddle is soft and adorable. The zip at the bottom of the leg area is convenient for diaper changes, and the leg area in general is great in that it gives baby a lot of room for movement. One can achieve a nice snug swaddle, but I find the Velcro tabs to be hard and bulky when engaged. To wrap baby properly, the tabs sit behind baby's back which could cause discomfort.I'm a big fan of the swaddle, but prefer using a blanket the old-fashioned way. I'm sure this wrap will be convenient and functional for those who don't mind using Velcro.",3
4817,"With so many swaddling products out there for new mom&#8217;s to try and knowing the benefits of swaddling for infant sleep, I wanted to make sure that I found a product that was safe and comfortable for our little girl.  The SwaddleMe WrapSack was extremely convenient with the bottom zipper for those night time diaper changes.  It is a great transitional product as baby begins to learn to sleep without swaddling.  It is very easy to put on our little girl.  The wrap is held together by velcro strips across the belly which stay in firmly in place.  She hasn&#8217;t wiggled her way out yet!  Our little one is very comfortable in it.  The cotton is keeps her cool but snug enough to sleep comfortably.  Plus she looks adorable in the pink elephant print!  It is easy to clean as well and washes up nicely in the washing machine.  It is a great addition to the SwaddleMe product line.",4
4818,"I bought this for our seven month old.... 20lbs, 27&#34;.  I was nervous that it wouldn't fit since the weight maximum is 20lbs.  He has SO much room to grow in this WrapSack.  I expect it will fit him for quite some time.  The pattern is lovely, the fabric is soft and cozy.  I love the bottom zipper.  I also love that it snaps over the shoulders to prevent the sack from slipping down the body during the night.  Our baby is ready to sleep with at least one arm outside of the swaddle.  The way the body wrapping pieces of this WrapSack attach to the sack, the fabric sort of pulls and gathers at the back when the wrap isn't up across the shoulders.  It digs into the back of Baby's armpit.  It doesn't look comfortable at all and I little guy didn't sleep well in it.  If you're still binding both arms, I'd say this sack is terrific but that's not what I wanted it for.  The description specifically notes that the arms can be worn inside or out.  I disagree.",3
4819,"I got the swaddle me wrap for the times that I am babysitting for my new grandson. He seems to be very comfortable in it and falls right to sleep. I love the way it keeps his arms in or out. I keep his arms in it, so he doesn't scratch his face. It's also great for when he needs to be changed, because you don't have to undress  him. It's machine washable as well. I'm thinking of buying a few more, just to have them when this one is being washed.",5
4820,"I have other SwaddleMe products, and they are much more satisfactory than this. In general, the concept is that they're swaddles for dummies. I.e., you don't need to figure out the ridiculous trick that allows swaddling with a banal, square blanket. Instead, you can just use the velcro to turn a formless sack into its baby-straightjacket mode. For those of you without a screaming infant, that's a major plus. A priori, I kind of imagined that they would lie there and gently submit to being swaddled (especially since they're supposed to like it). But they don't. They squirm and writhe and freak out. As such, velcro is a winner. (Although it is generally a nuisance all other times&#8230;). So, the other SwaddleMe products are a big win.This one is not so much.Let me start with the most obvious failure. The zipper runs not parallel to the length of the sleep sack (which is the way to do it that makes sense, because then you can just lay your baby inside), but rather transverse (which means that you have to pull it over the baby's head, so&#8230;instant unhappiness). Ostensibly, this makes it easier to change diapers. But, as is so often the case, the distance between theory and practice is rather vast. In reality, this just makes it much much harder to get LT into the sleep sack, and results in fussing, crying, and wailing. And the baby isn't happy either. As a side note, it also doesn't really make it easier to change the child. Alone, this would make it suboptimal and undesirable.As they say, however, &#34;But wait! There's more!&#34; To wit, despite the fact that the other SwaddleMe sleep sack that we have is Small, and this one is also Small, this one fits really poorly. LT is at&#8230;the 10th percentile or something like that in weight, and 75th percentile in length. So&#8230;not a huge baby. But it's not the length that is the problem. It's the girth. When I try to velcro the swaddle, it's a little TOO straightjackety. It's a bit ridiculous to imagine that many babies are going to fit well in this thing. I understand that swaddles should be tight but this is a bit extreme, reminding me of tasteless jokes from childhood.I was truly hoping that this would be an excellent product, like the Winter SwaddleMe that we have. I was pretty disappointed.I said all of that about the small size swaddle, and I was really hoping that the larger one would be better. But it really isn't. There is no middle ground here; our baby falls squarely between the sizes, and the large SwaddleMe is too big, and doesn't effectively swaddle.In a nod to sanity and to retain my sense of composure, I did what I always do with two star products. I tossed it aside, and went and got something else. In this case, I got the Halo 100% Cotton Sleepsack Swaddle, Amazon Product: B003E6OBMA, which I would give four stars.All my other complaints about the small exist here as well. Just go get something better.",2
4821,"Screw swaddling blankets.  I like swaddle sacks better; much easier to use.  This one is less bulky than the halo kind, and keeps baby snugglier.  The zipper on the bottom is a handy feature too, although I imagine for most babies you're not going to use it because it will wake them up, nonetheless.",5
4822,"Breastfeeding is an intensely controversial topic. Most people know the health benefits for the baby to consume its mother's milk, but social constraints often do not allow women to feel free to feed their baby in public. Using a scarf is not only an acceptable practice, but also makes a lot of sense for issues of propriety as well as comfort.This nursing scarf is pure cotton -- soft and comfortable. The fabric is somewhat breathable, but it is a very dark black color -- which means it'll match your wardrobe, but will also attract the heat in the summer.It is one size fits all and is quite large. It washes well in the washer.It is more of a shawl than a nursing cover; I suppose it can be used as a shawl when the children grow up!",5
4823,"This is basically a thick, slub knit T-shirt material, and is a large, generously sized piece of fabric with a slit about a foot long so if desired, you can keep it from moving around by putting your head through and wearing it as sort of a scarf and shawl hybrid.I would not wear this as a cover-up over baby's head necessarily, because baby won't be able to breathe very well under there and would get sweaty, but I found it was great for snuggling the baby up and making him feel comfortable while nursing, and it is also good for tucking around the baby and covering any skin that might be showing while he is nursing, though I wouldn't like to cover his head with any kind of nursing cover.I love my born free bliss nursing pillow, and this nursing scarf is a great accessory for new moms who are in that stage of having to nurse constantly for the first couple months to establish supply and a good nursing relationship. It's stylish enough that even nine months out, I'm still choosing to wear this as a scarf or wrap when baby wearing because it is so easy to put over my head and then tuck the ends around baby to keep him snuggled up and cozy on my chest.",5
4824,"This is a neat idea, and I really liked having something that was &#34;plain&#34; and suitable for the office.Unfortunately, I was really disappointed in the cheap feel of the material.  It was not soft or comfortable, and would not be something I would consider wearing as a scarf.Improve the softness and feel of the material, and this could be a great product.  In the meantime, I'll be looking for something else.",3
4825,"This has worked great as a nursing cover! During the newborn stage when I had to nurse more frequently and sometimes in public, it was nice to have something this discreet. Sometimes the other styles and patterns on the market almost draw attention to the fact that you are nursing, but the average person would have to look twice to notice that you're nursing with this product. My baby was able to breathe just fine with this, and at normal room temperature did not sweat or get overly warm while underneath the scarf. This would also make a great, unique gift for a baby shower. The packaging shows you several ways to wear this product as a scarf, but I found that there was just too much fabric, at least for my body type. I would definitely still recommend the product, though.",4
4826,"I would give zero stats if that was an option! It says you can wear this as a scarf but it's a huge amount of unwieldy material! It's also very hot! I used it in our house when the a/c was set to 72 and we had company. My baby was sweating profusely and I could not see him or what was going on. I highly recommend the covers that are designed to allow fior eye contact between mother and baby not this one. This was a waste of money but since I did use it I did not feel I could return it.",1
4827,"My daughter is nursing her baby girl and she tried this out.  The pros are that its color will match everything.  Also, the fabric is lightweight, so it's not too hot, but it's thick enough so you can't see through, and it's very breathable for baby.  The box that it comes in gives you several ideas of how to wear the scarf when you're not nursing.However, for a small person, the amount of fabric is just too much for it to be worn as a scarf.  If you're a bigger woman, then it would probably work great for you.",4
4828,"This soft and neutral pillow case / slip cover fits the Mombo perfectly.  Great to have an extra cover while one is in the wash or to change looks. Personal the Mombo gets used so often that a extra case was needed",4
4829,"Like a lot of people, I did not pay careful attention to this and ordered the cover rather than the pillow itself. It is a perfectly fine cover - nothing stands out as particularly amazing or terrible. One good thing is that it does fit on my boppy. I would probably buy it again even if I knew I was not ordering the pillow itself. (note that this isn't waterproof)",5
4830,"This cover was exactly how I expected it would be -- cute! It washed well, and fits the Mombo as it should.",5
4831,"I just received the Mombo Pillow Cover in the mail and I was very pleased!The packaging is very nice, sturdy and expensive feeling. It is in gender neutral colors and can be reclosed with Velcro. This makes it very nice if the parents have a few of these covers and want to change between them. The packing is also small, so it would not take up much room if kept.The pillow cover comes with two sides. One is a white background with orange, green and blue dots. The other side is gray with a more subdued pattern of gray, orange, and blue. The sides are light teal. The colors and pattern are 100% gender neutral making this perfect for any parent, including the rare ones who do not find out the gender of their child ahead of time.This cover is made of 100% polyester which makes it easy to wash. I will note it fells more like a cotton poly blend - not too slippery, not completely soft. Both sides feel like this - there is no 'minky' or super soft side like on some nursing pillow covers.It does fit all Mombo pillows and would make a nice add in if you are getting a nursing pillow as a gift for someone's shower or would make a nice addition to your own purchase so you can keep one cover in the wash and use one.Recommended.",5
4832,"As we all know, babies leak. From both ends.  :)  So once you've invested in the Mombo (which I also recommend---see that review), it's worth the extra $ to get the cover. The fabric is really cute (and soft), and you have two patterns to choose from. It's easy to put on the Mombo, and then you can toss it in the wash.Also, considering that the Mombo can be used later for tummy time and lounge time, it's likely to be on the floor, so again, you'll want to put it in the wash. If you plan to keep the Mombo for use with more than one child, the cover is a smart investment to make.",5
4833,"My daughter uses a Boppy, not a Mombo, and I ordered this thinking it was a whole nursing pillow, not just a slipcover.  So it was a happy surprise to find that it works great on a Boppy!  We love the cute pattern, and it breathed new life into a 3-year-old Boppy!!",5
4834,"We tested out several umbrella strollers in the store and this one costs just a small amount more but manages to have a much better selection of features.  The biggest advantages are the storage, which is a decent size and easily accessible and the one handed fold, which is a lifesaver when you are dealing with small children.  Unlike a lot of the cheaper strollers we looked at, it does have a 5-point harness, which means that a baby as young as 6 months (or maybe even a little younger if they have good head control) could ride in the seat.  It also has a higher weight limit which means that it can continue to be used for longer.  It pushes smoothly and the handles are at a comfortable height.  All in all, this one is a winner!",5
4835,"We've been looking for a different stroller - we have a pricy jogging stroller that we don't like to take places where it might get damaged or stolen, so we've used an umbrella stroller for those trips (or to fly). The umbrella stroller is not comfortable for parent (handles too short) or child (no padding), nor does it have storage.The Kolcraft stroller came as part of the Amazon Vine program. That being said, I'd totally buy this stroller. Because of a higher weight limit, it will be good until my son is at least 5, and isn't too heavy. It folds up easily, with one hand, and has a tray for drinks for parents and kids. It reclines, which my jogging stroller does not do.Pros:- 50 # kid weight limit, which is higher than most strollers in a similar price range.- Stroller only weighs 11.8# so it's easy to load/maneuver.- Snack tray for parents AND kids.- Large storage basked underneath.- The shade extends down about the same length as pricier jogging strollers and has a plastic view hole for parents to see their kids, which comes in handy if they are asleep.- Speaking of sleeping, the stroller reclines to 3 positions.- Supposedly has front wheel shocks.- Can fold using one hand, which is awesome for plane travel.Cons:- Might be difficult for some kids to get in without detaching the snack tray. If they are strapped in the 5-point harness and with the snack tray, it can be difficult to make emergency bathroom situations.- Both the parent and child cup holders are small.- Seat cannot be detached for cleaning.- The wheels are plastic, which I think negates the concept of front wheel shocks. Rubber wheels absorb a lot more bumping than this. It seems to bump less than the cheap umbrella stroller but definitely more than the jogging stroller.Overall, though, for the price, this seems like a good, decent stroller. We've been enjoying it at the zoo, museums, and for plane travel.",4
4836,"I ordered this to keep at our house when I babysit our grand baby. His mom and dad use their Quinny Stroller with infant car seat that attaches. I didn't want to spend that much money on a Quinny so I found the Kolcraft here on Amazon. The first time I took our grand baby for a spin around the neighborhood in the Kolcraft, the wheels started sounding like one of those worn out grocery carts but now that I've taken many walks around the neighborhood using this stroller, I think it is a pretty good value for the money. It's light weight, holds many objects under the seat....like my big can of bear spray LOL  I&#34;ve never tried folding it down to fit in my truck so I don't know how well that function works. If I have to take my grand son anywhere and need the stroller, I just toss the stroller in the back of our long bed pickup, no need to fold the stroller down.",4
4837,"For reference, we've been using theThe First Years Ignite Strollerfor a little over a year with our now 2 year old. Very much like it, other people have liked it, and after using it have bought their own.  It's taller and for us that works great.The Kolcraft isn't as tall, causing both of us (I'm 6' my wife is 5'8"") to feel a little less comfortable.  We wouldn't likely notice as much compared to most strollers, but the Ignite is just good in that way.  More of a problem are the front wheels. Considering how well made the rest of this is, I'm surprised by how cheap these wheels feel and function.  If you are walking fast they sometimes start rattling like an old shopping cart. They also tend to wander a bit making it a bit harder to steer. The cup holder is small (unable to hold our water bottles) and the plastic tray isn't as helpful as the zipped pocket on the ignite.  However, the child tray is great, allowing for a drink and a snack to be easily accessed.What I like even more is the shade. Most shades are seemingly decorative or made for cloudy climates. Here in SoCal we need something that really does protect from the sun and this one does, going over and even a little down at the front, creating a great shield from sun and weather. There's a plastic window on top, so our girl can look up and say hi to us and we can see what she's up to. It folds down easy and is light weight and has great storage.If not for the frontwheels and the height issue we'd be entirely sold on this one.  As is, it has strengths and weaknesses in comparison making them about equal with different qualities.  We end up using this one for our daily walks and leaving the Ignite in the car for trips elsewhere.  So we like the Kolcraft even with the minor issues.",4
4838,"Overall we have been pleased with the portability and features of this stroller for the price.  I was surprised that no one else has mentioned that the stroller's handle is quite low.  Hubby wishes he did not have to hunch over to use this.",4
4839,"This stroller folds up easily, is very easy to push (I often do so with one hand), is attractive, and is quite comfortable for my 28lb 2 year old. It's been our go-to stroller every since we bought it.The only downside is that if we hook our diaper bag onto it, and our child isn't in the stroller, it WILL tip over.  That's the reason for the four-star rather than five-star review.  But if you are smart enough to keep the diaper bag in the carriage underneath (which means you have a smaller diaper bag than we do), you won't have this issue.",4
4840,"I was happy to received this tub. It is light weight and it folds away, no needto have something bulky around the house. When I am done I just simply dry it andfold it under my sink. This is mostly good for newborns possibly too light weight for bigger babies butif you use it in the sink like I do then its probably not a big deal.This is completely portable and we take with us when we go camping or say at a hotel.",5
4841,"Very disappointed in this product. I would not risk putting my baby in it. On the pro side, it's ultra light and portable. You can fold it up. The drawbacks, it has a plastic and cheap feel to it. The inflatable inner liner is so unwieldy, not to mention, it does not look sturdy or safe. Maybe it works to take on trips or in a pinch, but I would not use it regularly.",2
4842,"I was really unimpressed with this tub at first glance. It seemed like a beach toy more than a baby bathtub. There are two inflatable pillows that were a little difficult to blow up. (If you are an expectant mother, have this blown up and ready before baby comes home for bath time. Believe me, you won&#8217;t want to do this in sleep deprived new parent mode.) The tub still folds up nicely when it&#8217;s fully blown up.The inflatable pillows actually work better than I would have thought. They attach to the side of the tub so you can put one, both or neither leaning forward depending on the age and needs to your baby.The main criticism I have about this tub would be that it doesn&#8217;t seems like a long term tub. The vinyl and inflatable portion does seem very much like a pool toy, and anyone who has tried to keep a beach toy from year to year knows how well that can work out. We stored our baby stuff in the attic between kids and this could definitely not go into the attic. I can&#8217;t image that this would store very well even in a climate controlled area.",3
4843,"The colors on this tub are so bright and happy, which I love. It seems pretty sturdy although I don't think I will take it apart to store it, as it took some effort to blow up the liner. Works well for the baby, and I can see this being perfect for a tiny dog, too. Unfortunately my dog is way too big for this. Pretty pleased with this tub.",4
4844,"The Vue stroller from Baby Jogger is built for versatility and maneuverability for trips to the grocery store or when travelling.  It is relatively light-weight and collapses easily for storage or to go in the backseat or trunk and is easy to push when folded up.The seat is easily reversible in just a few seconds, and it can even lay flat for naptime.  The canopy provides good protection from the elements but is open so that baby can sight-see.  The padded harness provides good protection against accidents but is easy to apply and remove.The frame is sturdy with reinforcing struts.  Four sets of eight slightly-oversized wheels keep it steady going over bumps and make it easy to steer.  The hand grips are large and comfortable.  The stroller can be pushed with one hand and maintains balance even with a diaper bag hanging from it.Overall, a good choice for a portable stroller.",5
4845,"I have used Levana monitors for years now. They are nearly indestructable. I know, I've dropped prior models numerous times, even down the stairs and they have held up. And as my children have grown, triplets, and gained the ability to be destructive, my old Levana was used by them like a football. After my sister had her first child, I wanted her to invest in one as well. But she's still in some mode were she needs to the &#34;best&#34; mom ever, a title that has never existed. To save her sanity, and her husband's, I watch their baby on the weekends. And the one item that is a necessity to me? The Levana.I'm not as young as I used to be, so I crank the volume up, place it right in my eye-line on the nightstand and I am prepared. What I would like to point out, sound quality is great but picture quality is flawless. My husband even remarked on how clear it is. One issue, getting the battery in there was not an easy task. I'm going to chalk it up to me being a bit rusty.",5
4846,"The product is sleek and the camera is really shiny, really white, and comfortable to touch -- it would fit in with any decor in the baby's room. The video receiver is really bright yellow, which is a good neutral color for both girls and boys and would compliment any room.The device transmits immediately when you turn the camera on.There is a definite lack of instructions in the box -- do you need to charge prior to first use? What is the maintenance on the device? There are two very tiny handouts in the box that show what each symbols on the device means and how to plug-in the chargers. They also refer you to a website.There are two reasons for why I might've not seen instructions:1) since this is a free product given to me as a reviewer, perhaps they didn't add it to my box (the item came in a non-descript box without their logo/upc code, etc.);2) the manufacturers think that their device is so simple to use that it doesn't need instructions (this is a fallacy -- every device should have instructions even if they are redundant and the customer chooses not to use them -- but the customer needs to be given the choice)Be ware, that it might be that this product does not contain instructions.In terms of the visibility of the baby or what is going on in the room, you will be able to see the baby in sepia colors. You will be able to tell what is hapepning overall, but it is not by any means a perfectly clear picture that lets you see the baby as if you are in the room.The device is activated by your voice or the baby's voice, so you will always know if something is amiss.For the price (currently $89.99 on amazon), you get a very sleek, functional baby monitor.",5
4847,"I have owned 3 different baby monitors at 3 different price points and this onewins hands down. The most expensive one at around $300 is not any better thanthis one. I love this one because:1. It has a CLEAR color display. My other 2 are black/white.2. it is SMALL. Which makes it very portable when doing things around the house.3. Love the YELLOW color scheme. Neutral for any gender.4. It is EXPANDABLE for 4 other camera in different location around the house. if you have more than one small child.5. It can be a NIGHTLIGHT.6. INFRARED for night time.7. The RANGE is great. In our house I can go around over 100 ft without any issues.8. Two Way WALKIE TALKIE - So your baby can hear you9. It does not buzz like my other 2. This drove me nuts are nightIn thinking of any cons I really cant find one, well the only thing would be the Tilt on the camerawhich for some families this can be a problem but there are always ways to make it work.I know some people complain about the size of the display but to me that actually a plus so that it can be more portableinstead of bulky and in the way.I highly recommend it.",5
4848,"I gave this to my friend for her new baby, and she won't stop raving about how awesome it is.  It is so much better than a sound only baby monitor.  It is a good price, too, though I received mine free for a review from Amazon Vine.  I would, on her word, recommend it.",5
4849,"This is the cheapest baby monitor I&#8217;ve used, yet of the 3 used for comparison (a Motorola MBP26, and a VTech Communications Safe and Sound, and this one) I like the hand unit the most. It has the clearest image in my opinion (it looks like a mini HD screen), and the thinnest hand unit. Good reception around the house, and good night vision. 2 Individual chargers are included: one for the video unit, the other for charging the hand unit. Definitely recommended.",5
4850,"This is a good option for a portable baby camera solution.  It has good color resolution, night vision capability, and is fully portable -with a rechargeable backup battery.  It also has audio, and allows you to push a button and talk back to the camera.  (Additionally, it also has an antenna that can be flipped up to give you more range -helpful if you are outside.)  Finally, it allows you to turn the brightness up or down which is what you'd need to do if you wanted to use this outside.PROS:+++ CAMERA HAS COLOR PICTURE.  Don't they all, these days? But, in any case, it is color and looks nice.  Picture quality is excellent+++ HAS NIGHT VISION.  Once the room gets dark enough the color disappears and the picture becomes black and white, but allows you to see in the dark.  This function works very well.  And once the light is turned on it switches right back to color.+++ GOOD AUDIO.  You can hear pretty well from the camera's microphone and there is a neat LED across the top display which lights up more LEDs the more the camera picks up noise.  So, there would be a visual indicator of red LEDS if the baby was crying.  (This is helpful because if you muted it you'd still know the baby was crying by the LED indicators.)+++ RECHARGEABLE BATTERY.  This is pretty awesome.  You can unplug the monitor station and take it with you around the house.  It will typically last all day, but require recharging near the end of the day if baby has had multiple long naps.  (However, you can also use it plugged in as well.  You do not need the battery.  In fact, we use both.  We keep it by the bed at night, plugged in, and then move it downstairs in the morning or during afternoon naps, and only use the battery at this time.)++ TALKBACK FUNCTION.  You can press a button and talk back to the camera -it acts just like an intercom.  This might be useful if you were using it in the house with young children.++ EASY VOLUME UP OR DOWN.  Right below the screen there is a very simple to use volume toggle.++ LOUD CHIRPING WHEN BATTERY RUNS LOW.  When the (rechargeable) battery is going to run out (usually at the end of a day of usage, after at least a few hours of baby naps) it produces a loud beep every minute.  At first I hated this but then I realized how important and helpful it was.  It was basically telling me, &#34;hey, I am going to turn off in 5 minutes, and you need to charge me&#34;.  God forbid it just turned off and you went happily about your business in another room (or were sleeping) not realizing the monitor was no longer working, and then something happened to your child.  This was a great feature, and it reinforces my high opinion of this product.++ CAN HOOK UP MULTIPLE CAMERAS.  I didn't use this function but I found the menu on the device.  It clearly can hook up to three other cameras, and you can view them at the same time (I believe) while then selecting the main camera to watch.  I did not test this function so please do your own research on this capability.++ MONITOR FLIP OUT STAND.  This means you can place the monitor almost vertical, which provides an easy viewing angle.++ HAS A TEMPERATURE GAUGE.  This is a neat feature, and I liked it.  It shows you the temperature of the room with the camera right on the monitor.+ TALK BACK FUNCTION WORKS WELL.  This is an improvement over the other Levana monitor, where the talkback function sounds metallic.  This does not, and sounds pretty good.CONS:-- VISIBLE LIGHTS.  Unlike the other Levana camera set (Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White) ) which has no NO VISIBLE LIGHTS, this one has an unfortunate red power LED on the front, and a dual LED yellow one on the top.  Unfortunately this provides a focal point for your baby.  Not a big deal for a very young one, but I guarantee if your child can stand he or she will immediately swat this from the crib unless it is anchored on the wall.-- DOES NOT SWIVEL.  Also unlike the other Levana camera set (Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White) ) this monitor does not swivel on the X axis (horizontally), only the Y axis (vertically).  This means that if you mount it against the wall (hardware not included) you will need to place it exactly above your crib in order to get the proper view.  No placing it on a side wall or at an angle like with the other monitor noted above.  If you have a well situated tall table, however, this may not be a big deal for you.-- NO BELT CLIP.  This kind of cripples the use of this as something you'd wear while working outside.  But, on the other hand, presumably you'd want to SEE it, and wouldn't want to carry it around on your belt.  That said, it would have been nice, at least to help in monitoring a baby sleeping.  It does have a stand.  It looks like a belt clip but it is not, and it will come apart with very little pressure.  It is only useful to stand up the monitor.Overall, I am happy with this product, but I would pick the other Levana monitor over this one because it swivels more, and doesn't have lights on the front.  The temperature gauge wasn't important enough to me to sway the deal.  Either way, however, I highly recommend this brand, and I recommend both this (and the other monitor) in particular.  I have used the almost identical one for over a year and it continues to hold up well.  This one has done well for about a month now.",4
4851,"Have owned and recommended Levana baby monitors for a good three years.  It may be a minor thing for some, but I LOVE that this monitor is in a light yellow because its not only pretty but works in a baby boy or girl room.  So easy to use and a good price as well.",5
4852,"We have a new grand baby and this Levana Sophia 2.4&#34; Digital Video Baby Monitor is wonderful. It was SO easy to set up. Having gone through two monitors with our 4 year old grandson, we like this one so much more! The fact that the nursery is yellow just happens to make the cheery yellow monitor even seem personalized for us. We love the fact that you can talk to the baby through the camera if need be. The picture is clear, night or day, and the temperature reading is a great addition. The LED lights' colors help make it easy to tell what is going on. With so many features, at a reasonable price, I'd strongly recommend this baby monitor!",5
4853,"I've used several video baby monitors and this one is a good one if all you need is the basics.The parent unit is compact, and the camera doesn't take up much space.  It has very good range as well, although as you get further away, you'll see &#34;lines&#34; through the picture.  It's almost like interference but it's not snow.  The refresh rate is kind of slow, but among entry level models, that's normal.  Monitors that advertise higher resolutions really don't have much better resolution than this one, since they almost all broadcast a  standard TV signal or half-resolution signal, regardless of the resolution of the camera itself.  The camera and picture are similar to most others in that colors are washed out, the refresh rate is low, and it has a hard time compensating for backlit subjects.  If you're using this to monitor a crib, most of these things aren't a problem.What this monitor lacks compared to higher end ones is the pan/tilt/zoom type of feature.  Sometimes that's useful if you have a room where the camera isn't a wide enough angle to see everything in one position.  The other thing is that even though this camera can be tilted up or down, it can't be rotated on its base.  Therefore, if you plan to wall mount, it needs to be in a direct line with whatever you're monitoring.Levana has a nice system where the video screen can shut off while the audio is still present.  Then, if a noise exceeding a certain volume level is heard, the screen will automatically wake up.  So, if you need to use it on battery power for a while, it's not going to drain too quickly.Overall, this is a good entry level monitor that functions well and if you only need the basics.  More expensive monitors generally won't give all that much better color or resolution and often a larger screen just saps battery faster and looks more pixelated anyway.",4
4854,"First off, I&#8217;m not sure why they made the parent unit this ugly yellow color. It doesn&#8217;t enhance the unit as the color is not pleasing and the two tone color is unnecessary. It would have been much better if the unit was a solid white.The picture quality for the monitor itself is decent for this price point. (Note: since I received this monitor, the price has fluctuated by almost $50. Make sure you pay attention to the price changes if you don&#8217;t need this item immediately.)I would put this monitor on par with most monitors in the &#60;$100 range. The picture quality is decent and the sound it good. This monitor has a feature that I have not seen before &#8211; it tells you the temperature of the baby&#8217;s room. That&#8217;s a nice perk, but not a necessity.Much like most monitors, the talk to baby feature is kind of like a loud speaker at the supermarket. I don&#8217;t care for this feature for babies, although it works well as more of a walkie talkie for younger kids.",4
4855,"This Levana Sophia video baby monitor was just what we needed to keep track of the twin grandchildren while they are sleeping.Not only does this work well but it looks nice too - sleek and unobtrusive.Be sure to take the click-on stand off of the monitor before installing the flat rechargeable battery that is included. Otherwise you aren't going to be able to get the battery door open all the way.The camera runs off of a plug-in adaptor but has the option to run off of four AAA batteries (not included). Much easier and cheaper to just plug it in. It has a 6 foot long cord.The power supply for recharging the monitor works quickly and also has a 6 foot long cord.Picture quality is very good (I was surprised at how good it was) and so is sound quality.The instruction manual that comes with the set-up is laughable but I was able to download a much more detailed manual from the mylevana website.I am very pleased with this baby monitor and would recommend it to all new parents, grandparents, day care providers or anyone who wants to keep an eye and an ear out on little ones.",5
4856,"Levana continues to improve their camera and receiver technology and this one is better than the last two that I've had...  It's still not PTZ, but that's not necessary for a crib cam.  The receiver has a significant charge time, straightforward controls, and a tight sharp screen.  The temperature is a key feature that my wife and I require... Its a good feeling to see and know the temperature is good for our baby.This receiver supports up to 4 cameras, and I've paired 3 with it successfully.  The simplistic controls work for multiple cameras, but don't expect to use this as a security cam, it lacks controls for zone detections and other basic security cam features.",4
4857,"We have used 6 or 7 baby monitors over the years. They have ranged from the very high end units that have huge screens, wifi capability, pan/zoom, lullabies, and all of the other bells an whistles. For us, we have found that a relatively basic camera - with a decen sized screen (and the Levana Sophia's 2.4&#34; screen falls into that category) is the best for us.Notes-- The base unit and the camera pair very easily (automatically) with each other. We have used some brands that require a manual pairing, but not here- Expandable up to 4 cameras- Very easy to talk 2-way from the base unit/monitor. This may not seem like a big idea, but it is handy when the biggest most prominent button is the two way talk button.- The night vision mode is grainy, but it is the equivalent of EVERY baby monitor on the market. Unless you are willing to spend A LOT more you will need to accept a grainy night vision shot. Honestly, we have gotten used to the view quality.- The screen is big enough.... some (higher priced) baby monitors have larger screens, but we have found that this is not always what it is cracked up to be. Larger screen add to the weight (not that big of a deal), size (a bigger footprint on your night stand), typically decrease video quality (because the cameras are rarely improved enough to offer a picture for the increased resolution), and it decreases battery life.- The Levana Sophia monitor is completely rechargeable- It does come with a built in room thermometer (which can be set to both Fahrenheit and Celsius) - we just wish the displayed temperature was a larger and easier to read.- We have not had any problem with the camera interfering with our internet, cell phones, or cordless phones..- One feature that it does not have - that we kinda like having (again it does come at a cost) is a pan feature. We may use the pan feature on the camera 2 or 3 times a year, and it roughly doubles the price point of the baby monitor.Final Verdict - If you are in the market for a video baby monitor the Levana Sophia is definitely worth considering . There are baby monitors with more features (larger screens, lullabies, video outputs, Wifi) but we have found that most of those features are very rarely used. What we want is an easy to use and very reliable baby monitor - and the Levana Sophia fits the bill perfectly!",5
4858,"I have a newborn grandson that I babysit for occasionally, so I got this video camera to use when he is here.I have used other Lavana video cameras in the past, and I love the quality of their products. This digital video baby monitoris no exception. The quality is great, the clearity of the display is amazing, and the night vision works awesome. The only thingI wish I could change is the size of the display. It is smaller then the ones I have used in the past, but the quality of the picture kind ofmakes up for that. The sound is very clear, even the sound of my voice when I talk to my grandson through this monitor. I also love the factthat it isn't Wifi, so no one can hack into it. It also doesn't interfere with my Wifi modem, so that is a huge plus. I would highly recommend thisbaby monitor, for the quality alone. The price on this one is less expensive then some of the other models they have, so this one is much more affordable as well.",5
4859,"This is an entry level baby monitor. It functions well for those that need video, sound, and the ability to talk to their baby. Being able to monitor the temperature in his/her room is a very useful feature, though in my testing it did not seem super accurate.My first impression of the unit was that it looked cheap. The yellow is a terrible color choice, and the whole thing is very lightweight plastic. The screen is VERY small. I use the Summer Infant video monitor which has a 4&#34; screen, which is twice the size of this one. I found the screen small, but did have good quality, especially with some light in the room. The night vision worked well and I was able to see my daughter clearly.Overall, it's an entry level video monitor that may work well for the right person. If you can spend about $75 more, you can get a much better unit.",4
4860,"I guess I should have seen on the product description that the screen was small, but it didn't hit until I realized it was smaller than my camera.  And I have to load the pictures from my camera onto my computer to see if they are good or not!  Some people have said they didn't like the yellow color of the remote, but if you move it around like I do, it's easier to see if it doesn't match the color of everything else.  Works well, good audio, easy to use and understand.  Way nicer than just an audio monitor.  The thermometer baffles me.  Who needs to know the temperature of the baby room?",3
4861,"The Levana Sophia baby monitor performs very well as a standard baby monitor.  I took the monitor and camera out of the package and charged the monitor and plugged the camera and positioned it facing the crib.  These are my thoughts:PROS:1.  Simplicity -  Very simple to setup.  Charge the handheld monitor for 6 hours and plug the camera.  Once you turn both of them on, they will immediately pair.2.  Clear sound - I could hear my baby stir. No static.3.  Clear video - I had no problem seeing the full crib and my baby day or night.4.  Inexpensive - Much cheaper than the other brand we have.5.  Night light -  The night light helps me see the crib and I can turn off the other night light we have.CONS:1.  View - it seems to be set a a wide angle.  I have to move the camera very close to see my baby.2.  Portability - The camera does not have batteries so that this cannot be relocated to areas without an outlet.  My other baby monitor which is more expensive has this feature.  I just mention this so that people understand what the capabilities of this baby monitor.SUMMARY:For the price, this is a great buy.  If you are looking for a basic baby monitor this functions very well.",5
4862,"We've been using this Levana Sophia camera with our newborn daughter and here are my thoughts on it:Pros:- Very sharp quality screen.  The picture is the best I've seen on the various baby monitors I have.- Easy to set up out of box.  It comes already connected, and you don't need to read the instructions.  It's very easy to operate.- Temperature display is a nice feature.- Talk to baby feature works well.Cons:- No pan/zoom/tilt feature.  As your baby gets older, it's nice to be able to move the camera in order to see her.  This camera doesn't offer that.- Small screen.- Ugly unit.  I didn't like the yellow color used on the monitor, and the camera itself also looks cheap.This is an entry level model, but the price doesn't reflect it.  I'd rather spend a little more and get the excellentLevana Astra 3.5"" PTZ Digital Baby Video Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom 32006 (White).",3
4863,"The Levana Sophia baby monitor has a fantastic image and fairly good range. The price range is average compared to other monitors in its class.The only reason I would not recommend this to a friend is that it doesn't have a zoom, tilt, or pan feature. If you had the camera installed directly over a crib and you weren't planning on moving it that would be ok. However, we took it with us on vacation and our son moved out of view from the camera. I was not able to move the camera to see where he was in the room. Unfortunately, that is a must have feature for me.I also have the,Motorola MBP26 Wireless 2.4 GHz Video Baby Monitor with 2.4"" Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan and Tilt. It has a very similar price point, but has the pan/tilt feature.",3
4864,"For my first baby I had just a noise baby monitor.  It was easy to use and was exactly as expected.  For the second baby, we decided to go for a video monitor.  Now, I recommend them to parents.  There are so many times that you wake up and just want to check on the baby, but you don't want to wake him/her up.  This is a good way to do it.  This is an inexpensive video monitor with a decent picture.  The night vision is way better than I expected.  If you want a relatively cheap video monitor, I would go with this one.  If you want to spend a little bit more though, you will get a lot more quality and versatility.  If you go up about $50, you can get a great Levana with all of the bells and whistles.",4
4865,"I had the chance to try this baby monitor out. I have had a number of other cameras and baby monitors and this one seems to be by far the simplest design. The unit I received did have a crack in the housing near the screen but it still functions. The camera itself has a clear picture in bright and low light situations. I find it odd the microphone is attached to the camera but it's not built into the camera housing it is pretty flexible. I found that audio was spotty using the microphone.Overall it is very easy to use with a good picture.",3
4866,"Parent friendly is an understatement for this product! It is so easy to use, just charge and go. The clip on the back of the monitor is a plus. I can clip it to my belt, jeans, or apron strings and go about the kitchen without a worry. The display screen has great clarity and the night vision helps me sleep better at night. I know I can just roll over and take a peek at the baby without disturbing him! We got it in yellow, so its gender neutral, so we can use for future babies despite the gender. The battery life is great! If fully charged, and I only use it on the night stand when I sleep, it will last several days. The range is also great. We can take the monitor out to the back porch of front yard without interference or picture disturbance. If we go too far, the quality of the picture gets a little poor and has lines on the display. You can still see it, but it's not clear. Overall, great product for a great price!",5
4867,"We were debating between getting a video monitor and just a regular baby monitor without video, but when we had the opportunity to get this one, we jumped at the chance. The baby is due this summer, but we have tested its functionality in anticipation for the new baby.It was really easy to set up -- did not even have to use the instructions. The handset comes with a rechargeable battery and the unit plugs in. We are excited to use all of the features like temperature and 2 way. We have tested them out and they work well. Switching between screens and features is easy.So far, the functionality is great, but will update with more of the active features once the baby comes!",5
4868,"I thought I'd give this product a try after ordering the Lorex Baby Monitor.PROS:The monitor is thick with a large base so that it is easy to sit on surfaceThe swivel adjustment adjusts forward instead of backwards, making it easy to adjust the camera without having to put something under the backside of the base in order to see a lower bedOnly has one LED light that stays on and that's the power lightThe &#34;talk&#34; feature is loud and vivid. When I whisper to my grandchild through the monitor she can hear me loud and clear, I've found this to be a challenge in other monitorsYou don't have to mess around with signing out of your wireless connection into another in order for it to work, which makes me feel more secure that someone else is not spying on my little oneI've not had ONE downtown period since using this product, which makes it reliable for meThe price is right compared to other monitor systemsIt allows up to four camera monitors on one systemThe camera has night vision and sound that allows me to see and hear what is going on when she is sleepingThe monitor allows you to turn volume down or mute itThe monitor has a stand on it that allows you to set it on your nightstandIt comes with a monitor period. Many others require you to use your smart phone or tabletCONS:The system only comes with ONE cameraThe monitor LED is smaller than desiredThe display is HD, but only in high lightThe display is very bright, however it does have the &#34;peep&#34; optionIf left on full-time, the monitor battery doesn't last long at allBesides that,  i really couldn't find anything else that I did not like about monitor",4
4869,"This is the only video baby monitor I have used, but I was very happy with it. The sound is crystal clear and the video is much better than I imagined it would be. I absolutely loathe setting up anything electronic, but setting this up couldn't have been easier and I love the remote. The screen is small, but it's so clear that I can't imagine needing anything larger. If you're looking for a basic, easy to use baby monitor for a reasonable price, this is the product for you!",4
4870,"This is good baby monitor for the price. I can see and hear the baby clearly and honestly I don't need fancy stuff- just want to make sure baby is safe and happy.So far I have no problems with battery's life, set up was easy and there is no cracking noises etc. Simple and easy.Recommended.",4
4871,"The Levana Sophia baby monitor is a good, though not great, entry in the crowded baby monitor segment.  It features a decent sized color screen, and is generally intuitive and easy to use.  It can be left on all the time, constantly streaming video and sound, or it can be set to turn on only when sound comes from the baby's room.  This can be a problem if you live in a more noisy environment, a loud car going by can set it off.  The picture quality is quite good, and the infrared mode works quite well, especially for this price point.  Two downsides: 1)battery life isn't great.  At least it's rechargeable, but it seems to run down quite quickly, even when I completely power down the receiver.  2) There is an option to &#34;speak to baby&#34; via the receiver.  I would recommend you not try it, lest you want to scar your little one for life - the sound that comes out of the camera is horrifying and robotic.  Simply pushing the button and saying &#34;go back to sleep sweety&#34; will come out like an evil robot-... a good idea, but doesn't quite work.",4
4872,"This is a great value for the price. The baby monitor is easy to use: you just charge it and go. No additional set-up is required. The screen is very clear, especially for its small size. The night vision works great. Audio is clear. No complaints here!",5
4873,"This system is great for a minimal needs in a video monitor.  A great feature is that when there is sound in teh room, the monitor screen turns on by its self.  We haven't had any issues with the battery dying like we did with our old monitor.  Also the temperature display is a nice additional feature, although sometimes it is diffucult to see depending on the lighting in the room. The distance is great between camera and monitor, especially when the antenae on the monitor is opened.",4
4874,"Baby monitoring technology has sure come a long way! My first child was born five years ago and we just had a basic voice monitor in his room. Nothing fancy, just something to alert me when he cried. But now, with this Levana Sophia monitor, I feel like I&#8217;ve stepped into the future!During the day, the image is really great. Colors come through and you can see exactly what baby is doing. At night in the dark, the picture still comes in clear (albeit in black and white) and you can see every movement baby makes.other features that I like: the temperature sensor. The baby&#8217;s room in over the garage so it&#8217;s always a little bit hotter or colder than the rest of the house. With the temperature monitor, I can tell exactly what it is and adjust things accordingly.I do like the peep mode where you can turn it off to save the battery and then it automatically comes on when it detects a sound. Of course in honesty, I have not been able to take it off of peep mode, however I haven&#8217;t really researched with the manual.So far, the range seems really good too. The parent unit has a rechargeable battery so you can have it with you at all times. I&#8217;ve taken this everywhere in my house and it always works. The only exception is if I go behind our brick fireplace. The think the brick must block some of the transmission but since I know it&#8217;s a dead spot, I don&#8217;t go there often.All in all, I&#8217;ve been very impressed with this monitor and wish I had something like this with my first kid!",5
4875,"When I have the grandbaby here I feel so much safer knowing I can see and hear her when she is in the other room",5
4876,"So hard to imagine that a company that manages to make a baby camera with such great video quality was able to make the whole thing looks so bad. The yellow-ish monitor makes no sense, and the camera looks like a late 90's webcam.Also, the menu options couldn't be harder to access - someone put a lot of effort into making this thing hard to use.But when you ignore all of that, you have a very, very good baby camera with excellent range. No interference, and easily reached over 100 feet within my home.Both pieces can be used with the included AC adapters, and the monitor can use (not included) batteries.My ONLY other issue is the sheer number of baby cameras made by Levana - there have to be at least 25 here on Amazon, making it very hard to find the best option.",5
4877,"Maybe it's just me, but I'm sorry, the yellow plastic casing on the handheld viewer looks so cheap to me.  It was my first thought when I opened the box. The set up was a breeze and this is perfect for those that don't have smartphones and want a handheld monitoring device.  We have used the camera several times in the last month and it works great - my teen son loves talking to the monitor so the little tot can hear him!  Kind of a neat device, but I wish they had picked something other than yellow plastic. I guess if that is the worst complaint, it has to get 4 stars from me!",4
4878,"Overall, this was a pretty good monitor. The resolution and framerate (~25 fps) is excellent for practical usage, but isn't as good as, say, a video camera; it looks like a strong sharpening algorithm has been applied to the image, which helps with visibility on the small screen. The same goes for the sound quality (which is at least as good as a cell phone). The camera has infrared technology, so the video is just as good in both dark and light conditions, and the signal range is also pretty good - up to about 90 feet (although the framerate drops to around 10 fps at that distance).I also like the back-and-forth talking capability - the parent can press a button, and speak to the baby through the handset. I have to wonder what the baby thinks of that, though... ""Daddy shrunk and is sitting on the table!"" The camera even looks like a dude wearing a headset; you can't tell from the pictures, but there's a little microphone extending to the place where the mouth would be.The camera itself needs to be plugged in, but the handset is chargeable, so you can unplug it and carry it around with you. The power supplies for both the camera and the handset are the same and are interchangeable (they have the same input/output and connectors). They don't look exactly the same, though; the wall plugs look different, and one of them has a picture of a handset on it. I can only assume that it was meant to be used for the handset, although it also works for the camera.  It would have been nice if a micro-USB charger worked with either, especially the for recharging the handset.The instructions are mostly in pictures and don't use very much text to explain usage, and the handset interface is designed without any text, so the monitor is great for people who don't understand English. It can be a little confusing at times (I had some trouble figuring out how the settings worked), but basic usage is very quick and simple.The camera part of the monitor can be rotated to point upwards or downwards, but it's a bit limited; it cannot point very far up or down. It can be mounted on the wall, but due to the small range of movement, it will probably end up pointing towards the floor. Tabletop usage is fine, however.Being able to see the temperature in baby's room is a very nice touch, and will be particularly reassuring during very cold or hot weather.  Obviously this would also be very useful in monitoring pets in the garage or in an enclosed patio etc.I would recommend this monitor to a parent who wants an easy, safe way to keep an eye on his or her baby.",5
4879,"This is a great value for the price,it is affordable and attractive unit.. It is easy to set up and is consumer friendly.:The night vision is more than acceptable,and the volume works well.I like the dialogue feature,where you can communicate with the other person in babies quarters.The screen is small but sufficient.It is an affordable and practical modern monitor.",4
4880,"We have used baby monitors with both our son and daughter.  This one has by far beat the rest!  So much so that when a family member had a baby recently, we order another one for her!The reasons are several reasons I would not hesitate to recommend this monitor over others:- In this safety conscious time - it has a private, secure and interference-free digital signal that no one but you can view!  No worries about others leeching in on your signal and seeing what your baby is doing!  You can even add three more cameras to your device.- During the summer you can check the temperature in your baby's room, remotely to see if it is getting too hot or too cold- Large bright colored screen for easy viewing!This monitor also includes a talk to baby feature which allows your baby to hear your voice as you sing them back to sleep, a gentle nightlight to peek in on your baby without disturbing them and a nice battery length (48 hours)for peeking in on your baby.",5
4881,"Pros:- Excellent picture quality- Great color and night vision- Both units operate on battery, with some power saving options built in.Cons:- Super janky design.  Camera unit is white, monitor unit is a pale, hospital yellow.  Yuck.- Camera unit has a 2-3 inch &#34;tale&#34; sticking out (which I think is the microphone), which is only shown in 1 of the many marketing photos.- Battery covers were VERY hard to remove.- Monitor settings are VERY confusing and not well explained, even in the detailed operating manual (which was not included in the box, I had to go the website to get the PDF.)",2
4882,"As of now, I have installed Baby Monitors in literally every room - twin boys and living in a high rise comes with its own risk and need to keep a tab on them all the time.I have both Wifi based Baby monitors as well as non-wifi Baby monitors - Ideally I would suggest you to get one of each.  Wifi based monitors are made by Motorola and Netgear - ones from Netgear (VueZone) are truly truly awesome - nothing ever comes close to them.For in-home/non-wifi cameras - Levana is very good : build quality is very good, video/image quality is very good, range is good for a 3-4 bedroom house and all come with rechargeable batteries.",5
4883,"This is a really nice baby monitor that frankly would have been priced at $200 not too terribly long ago. The video is surprisingly clear and the setup is super easy. This is the more pocket-able/handheld version made by this company; they do also make versions with larger screens but of course it does sacrifice portability. I can see other uses for this handy device also such as a basic home surveillance system or just keeping an eye on anywhere you need to. For a well-priced baby monitoring system, however, it's a home run.",5
4884,"I was a little reluctant to try another video monitor, after a less than wonderful experience  with the iBaby monitor a few months ago.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the line of Summer brand blankets, but I wasn't sure if that quality would extend to monitors.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this monitor.  The set up was quite easy, and the video quality was very good, especially for the price point this is offered at.  Since I have used sound monitors exclusively (the exception being the iBaby fiasco) I wasn't sure what to expect from a video monitor.  I was very impressed with the quality.  Obviously it isn't HD quality, and the &#34;daytime&#34; color picture is better than the B/W &#34;night vision&#34;, but the B/W picture is still a good quality image.  In my opinion, the sound quality of this monitor isn't on par with my Sony monitor, but I didn't find it to be hard to hear, &#34;tinney&#34;, or warbly, as some of the others reviewers stated.  I was/am very pleased with this monitor.  I feel like this is one of the best choices for a video monitor, especially if you are looking for one at a reasonable price.  Very happy with this item, I highly recommend it.",5
4885,"Full disclosure: this is a freebie for me, through the Amazon Vine program.I ordered this monitor, thinking it might be a nice upgrade to the audio monitor I've been using with my two year old, with the intention of replacing that one once I have my new baby in a few months.  But I likely will not, and this is why:This monitor does not use DECT technology, with is technology used to encrypt audio signals, which prevents people from being able to use your monitor to listen in on your household.  My current monitor does.  I've heard stories in the news about people being able to see into the houses of others using their baby monitors, and that's just not something I want to worry about.  Therefore, I will keep my old monitor (the Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology) and just be content with being able to hear the baby.",1
4886,"I have now tried this monitor out in 3 different house and it worked well in 2. In our house (built in the 1960s), we had no problem with the signal going through 3 floors. I thought that the monitor's screen was a little small but the picture was so clear, it wasn't a problem.At my in-law's house, again we had no issues but they have an open floor plan so I didn't foresee any issues.At a beach house, the signal didn't even reach around the corner. Not sure what that house was made of but the monitor only worked down the hall. If I went around a corner, it was gone.So I would recommend this monitor if you live in a small house or apartment. It is easy to set-up and it works very well when it does work.",4
4887,"Ok for full disclosure neither me nor my wife are pregnant. However, we do like to have shaped pillows to help support our necks, backs, and other shaped body parts. The Born Free Comfort Pillow does have a few advantages over a basic pillow, but it is not exactly perfect.Notes-- First of all - it has a very strong odor when you first take it out of the packaging- Has a removable slip cover that can be washed- While it designed for pregnant bellies it can still be used for other parts of your body - although it did take some getting used to.- For both my wife and I the body pillow did seem a bit too springy for our liking.... not a big deal and is very similar to other polyurethane pillows.Final Verdict - The Born Comfort probably is better used by someone who is pregnant, but if you can find the right position it can work for just about anyone.4 Stars",4
4888,"I got this pillow for my daughter who was expecting my second grand child. She was having a horrible time sleeping, because she was so uncomfortable. She tried this pillow and told me that she was finally able to get comfortable, and sleep right through the night. The pillow fits right under her belly, so it keeps the weight of the baby off of her back, which was giving her back aches during the coarse of the day. The baby is finally here now, and she still uses the pillow to get comfortable while feeding the baby. The cover is removable and machine washable, so there's no worry about it being clean. I highly recommend this pillow for expecting mothers.",5
4889,"I know this is marketed as a belly pillow, but I have found it provides great support for my back.  I use the smaller part of the &#8220;L&#8221; shaped pillow under my head, and the longer part along my back.  Works really well.I like that the cover is removable so that it can be washed.  The fabric was a little stiff out of the package, but much better now.After more than a month&#8217;s use, the pillow seems to be holding up okay.  I doubt that it will last for years, but will certainly get you through 9 months.",5
4890,"I ordered this pillow shortly after giving birth to my son. It makes side sleeping extremely comfortable, is a nice shape and isn't gigantic like so many pregnancy/postpartum pillows out there. It's well made and has just the right amount of firmness, and I love that it comes with a slipcover.As much as I love this pillow for sleeping, I've actually found it to be quite useful for breastfeeding as well! My son feeds well on my left side but has always struggled with my right. I've found that we can get the best latch on the right with the football hold but it's difficult to get comfortable in this position and feel like baby is fully supported. It turns out that this belly pillow is a perfect height for laying next to my right side when feeding my son in the football hold to help support his lower body and legs. My Boppy pillow is just too firm for this application but the Born Free belly pillow is just right.I have nothing negative to say about this pillow and am thrilled that I have found multiple uses for it. All in all a great product!",5
4891,"The Comfort Belly Pillow by born free is a decent support pillow to help moms have extra support during their pregnancy and after. The design of most is a &#34;hug&#34; form, and it provides the tummy the best support especially for a more comfy sleeping position. I like that the removable cover is 100% cotton and its soft and breathable and washable!I have tried a few support pillows out and personally I prefer the wedge or the long S pillows. This one does a good job, but its a good &#34;half&#34; pillow. I find I look for another pillow when I use it. *I'm currently 6 months expecting* The S pillows  help support my legs and keep my whole body comfy, but they are big. The wedge helps support just my belly when I don't want to deal with a thousand pillows. And sometimes I do still use this one for some belly and arm support when laying on my side. So I do alternate. Everyone is different so use what is best for you or where you need the most support.",4
4892,"I didn&#8217;t realize how useful and necessary a product like this was until I had one during my pregnancy.  I also had a larger body pillow which was nice, but is so bulky, it takes up all of the room on my bed.  This belly pillow is a great way to get support for the belly and relieve pressure off of my back.  It stays in place while I&#8217;m sleepy, but is not so heavy and bulky that I can&#8217;t move it while I&#8217;m sleeping without disturbing my husband next to me.  It is perfect for sitting on the couch or car rides too!  It keeps its shape while I sleep too.  I was afraid that it would flatten because it the filling is so light weight, but it does not at all!  The washable cover makes it very easy to take care of.  I often switch between my full body pillow and this belly pillow.  Great product!",4
4893,"Our baby loves this cup. 12 months old and going from breast to cup was easy. It is not one of those hard lids that babies chew on and damage. This is softer semi-soft medium think silicon type nipple lid that allows the baby to use this like the breast, which we love. It had removable handles to teach holding a cup, and comes apart so easy to clean.",5
4894,"This cup is the perfect choice for a first sippy for your little one and is rated for 4 months and up.  The soft spout will protect your little one's teeth while helping them transition from the texture and feel of the bottle.  The lid has a revolutionary design that is truly no drip even when turned upside down.  The handles are detachable which is a great feature to help your little one improve his or her dexterity.  The cup holds 5 ounces and is easy to measure thanks to the marks on the side of the cup. It's the perfect amount for little ones.  This is a great cup but it's only downfall is it's price compared to others on the market.",4
4895,"I got this cup for my little boy and to my surprise it came in pink. Needless to say not the color that I wanted. The price is also high in comparison to other cups in the market.The spout is soft and seems more like a bottle nipple which the baby liked plus when the baby moved the cup nothing spilled or came out from the spout which is a big plus in the cleaning area. It also has detachable handles which makes it easy again for cleaning and for the baby to move to handle free eventually. It has a capacity of 5 oz which for a baby of 4+ months is ok.",3
4896,"My toddler doesn't sit still. Ever. So having a cup of water for him to drink is always a gamble, because until this cup any other sippee left on it's side creates a puddle. Thankfully, he loves this cup and it's been amazingly dry and drip, spill, free. I've even *gasp* felt safe enough letting him hold it with his juice on the couch.Also, the fact that there isn't as defined of a 'spout' means less cup chewing, yay! I've gone through a few because of teeth holes. Plus the no spill device inside is super easy to remove and clean.However, something to note is that when you order them at this great price, there isn't a color choice. I don't care that he's using a lilac cup with rainbows on it, actually I really like it, but other parents might feel differently.Excellent cup!",4
4897,"These cups are large and sturdy, the lids close tightly and we have had zero leaks so far, but by far the best feature is the valve and lid combo. This is the first sippy cup (of dozens we have tried) to have a lit that has no nooks or crannies that are hard to clean. The valve separates into two pieces and is also very easy to clean. My biggest issues with cups in the past had to do with the inability to clean well and having to toss them for hygiene reasons, but I do not see that happening with these. We actually had to clean spoiled milk out already and it was so easy compared to other brands, I felt that the cup was indeed clean enough to use again and that there was no hidden yuck in a crevice.",5
4898,"The most important thing, the thermometer is accurate.I like that I can just glance at it across a room and know from the color what the temperature range is.Just be ware that their recommended setting is between 61 and 67 degrees F.blue (too cold) under 61 F.yellow (recommended) 61-67 Forange (a little warm) 68-75 Fred (too hot) over 75 FI tried to do some research for the right temperature to set the thermostat but I can't get a definite answer (even literature from different doctors' offices are different).I am worried about SIDS and this is a good tool to help with that.There is and on/off switch at the bottom.I like that it's not battery powered, one less thing to worry about.Just surprised how cold they want the room to be. It seems British recommendations are colder than American recommendations (this is a British company).",5
4899,"This is pretty nifty and after reading the literature it seems sensible.  It makes sense that room temperature can exacerbate a fussy baby's fussiness.  I get grumpy and don't sleep well if I am too warm or cold.  I never had a thermometer in my children's rooms.  The color changing aspect makes it very easy to glance (very quietly for you newbie parents) into the babies room and see what the temperature might be.  The digital readout gives a precise temperature but the color coding makes for both easy long distant viewing and a pretty night light.  It seems a bit pricey but if it means the baby might have a better chance sleeping through the night it is probably worth it. (Most parents have had times when they would have spent any sum to get a good nights sleep.)  Five stars if it were less expensive.  BTW the product page description was wrong as of this review.",4
4900,"How could one go wrong with this set? Soft bed sheets are tops, both for adults and for kids. This included the entire set.",5
4901,"I have four kids and I've been buying baby stuff and receiving Amazon Vine products for review for a while, so I've had the chance to try out a wide range of infant video monitors, including an older Summer brand monitor and their latest WiFi Monitor (which I did not like).For a reasonable price you get good video quality, an easy to use monitor (buttons instead of arcane menus for key features) with a nice big screen and it's expandable.However it doesn't display the room temp where the camera is.  This was a real deal breaker for me,  because at night when I'm downstairs I want to know if I've got the nursery room too hot or cold.  For really young infants, this has a real bearing on your SIDs risk.  For older kids I've found it plays a roll in how often they wake up at night and fuss.  If you woke up chilly and couldn't reach for a blanket, you'd be cranky too.Because of that it's really hard for me to recommend this as a baby monitor.  However if you've got a small house or if the room temp just isn't an issue for you, this is a affordable option that is really good at the most important part: seeing the baby.  Both the day and night image is very clear.However if the lack of a temp display doesn't work for you either, I send people to my standby: the Motorola MBP36.  The MB36 has about the same video quality and it displays the temp.  Be warned that it costs nearly twice as much and comes with a smaller monitor screen.  In an industry with no &#34;perfect&#34; monitor it's the one that keeps winning out for me.",5
4902,"We love this monitor.  It is a nice step up from our older monitor.  Great screen, battery lasts for the night without issue.  Highly recommend.",4
4903,"The Summer Infant In View Digital Color Video Monitor is, at first glance, a pretty unspectacular baby monitor. It doesn't connect to the internet, there is no tilt, no panning, it doesn't play music or lullabies or takes pictures - it is, however, a very solid video baby monitor. We've been fans of Summer products for a long time now. My most favorite and reliable baby monitor is a Summer similar to this one (it does have pan and tilt) but everything else is nearly the same. In one word: Reliable. We have Wifi monitors, monitors that sing and play music, take pictures and such but none of them are the work horses in our household like the Summers.The video stream is smooth, the resolution is clear, the night vision is superb and the unit picks up minute sounds - all brought unerringly to your big 5.5 screen.A highly recommended purchase of a sub $140 video baby monitor!",5
4904,"I love this baby monitor. I can compare this one to the Motorola MBP36 and I like this one better because the video quality is so much better on this one. I thought the MBP36 was good until I got this one, then it was absolutely no contest. In fact, I wish I could return the MBP36. The MBP36 is good because you can pan the camera remotely using the controls on the monitor and I like that the buttons on the monitor is on the face and not on the edges because that makes it so you are not constantly accidentally pushing buttons when you're carrying it, but that's it. In video quality, this one wins hands down and since that's the most important part - I prefer this one. The camera is static (doesn't pan).  This is a great camera that shows you enough detail on your baby - enough to where you can see them breathing - day or night.  If you want a camera that shows you more area, like the entire room, you may want to look into the wide angle version.What could be improved:1. Battery life of the monitor - it only lasts a few hours of continuous use. The charger does have an extra long cable, but it would be nice if the battery life was better.2. The buttons are all along the edges of the monitor - this is nice because you get a very nice big viewing screen, but not so nice because you're constantly accidentally hitting buttons on the thing when you're carring it around.3. Picture quality - Yes, it's much better video quality than the Motorola MBP36 and it's good enough that you can easily see your baby breathing, but it could always be better....if we're being greedy.What is great:1. Screen size is bigger and better than the MBP362. Great video quality - you can easily watch your baby breathing3. Great night vision - you can easily watch baby breathing4. Very reliable5. Excellent portability - I have a 1500 sq ft house on a half acre lot and I'm able to monitor the baby from pretty much my entire property. So everywhere in the house and out in the yard as well. Excellent. It beats the Motorola MBP36 in this area as well.6. Has an internal antenna which is way nicer than the externa antenna of the Motorola MBP36 - while still having better connection.7. The stand is better and sturdier on the monitor than the MBP368. Pretty much everything you need to monitor your baby.9. The monitor and camera can be closer together before you get feedback - basically, just as long as they are at least 2 feet apart, you won't have feedback issues. Not like the MBP36 which gets feedback if they are in the same room. This is especially important if you're trying to adjust the placement of the camera while looking at the monitor. Or - if you rig this up in your car to use as a car baby monitor (which I did). I would recommend using the non-wide screen version if using in the car, but this one would work as well. I love using this in the car because 1. It's way better than trying to rig up a bunch of mirrors to monitor my baby in her rear facing car seat. 2. You can't see the baby with mirrors if driving at night - but you can with this monitor because of the night vision. 3. With the zoom feature, you can easily see baby breathing in her car seat - this is especially important with the rise in incidents where babies stop breathing in their car seats. I am able to drive with confidence and not have to worry because I can totally see her face and chest and know everything is okay. I have the monitor mounted on my dash with a GPS monitor that accepts a 5&#34; screen.10. Durability - I've been using this in all different capacities, every day for the past 2 months and it's been going strong. I've dropped the monitor a few times and it's gotten scuffed on the edges, but still working great.Great product that I use on a daily basis and am extremely happy with.",5

The Anti-colic valve is really useful to minimize air bubbles ingested and thus less burps and baby farts.  We also liked: BPA free, top rack dishwasher safe, and boil/steam sterilization safe.  The size and shape of the bottle is easy to hold while feeding.  No leaks.  Overall:  Nicely designed baby bottles that are easy for the parents to use, and the baby to feed.",4
4907,"3.5 stars. The nipples on these bottles make the transiton to and from breastfeeding easy because they resemble natural breast shape/function.

At first the nipple has a tendency to collapse. We found that it helps if you gently pull on the bottle to create tension as the baby eats.Personally, I would prefer the bottle without the valve at the bottom.

4908,"These bottles work great and they clean well. Best of all, this bottle releases milk as the baby puts pressure on it, just like a breast. That makes it easier for a baby to drink. Best of all, these have slow flow nipples which I needed through my entire time bottle feeding since I chugged too quickly. 30 something years ago these were not available and I used to choke myself. These bottles keep that from happening. They are great and make a wonderful gift. Recommended!",5

I got mine in about 3 days. The fix is easy and completely resolves the problem, which leaves you with theeeee most perfect travel stroller EVER. Before finding this stroller I had purchased the Peg Perego umbrella stroller which was $250- and it completely sucked. It was noisy and felt so cheap that I honestly worried I was going to break it. The Nano stroller is nice and smooth, quiet, and feels more like a real full-size stroller and less like a cheapy travel stroller. The fold is super compact, and easy to do- but it is not one handed (my only complaint). It comes with a travel bag, which you can easily just slide over the stroller and then.... here's the best part.... you can just take it ON the plane with you! No more worrying about your stroller getting dinged up and broken in the cargo hold! I just can't tell you how pleased I am with this purchase!And I forgot to mention another favorite... the basket. Umbrella stroller baskets are a joke. You can actually fit a diaper bag or a handbag under the nano, which is fantastic!Also, others have mentioned how annoying it is that the canopy covers the handle when its in the upright position. This didn't annoy me or my husband at all.",5
4917,"I am not a small person (5'7&#34;, 230 pounds) and neither is my wife, who is pretty tall (5'10&#34; and 200 pounds) and this carrier worked great for both of us.We have 3 kids, a 2.5 year old and 1.5 year old twins. One of the twins is pretty clingy, so we have been using this to carry her on my back, while the other two ride in our double stroller.  We also tried this with our older daughter (also in the back wearing position) who doesn't weight much more than our heavier twin (around 30 pounds), and it worked... although she is a bit too independent to want to be carried!The material is soft, yet sturdy and the entire carrier is very well made.  The shoulder straps are padded so they are comfortable, but yet not bulky.  The feature that really works well with this is the wide adjustable waistband. It has a strap that securely keeps the waist strap closed, and then velcro that makes it super adjustable. Since it's adjustable, I made my sister try it with my nephew as well (she is only 5'3&#34; and 130 pounds) and she liked it as well - so much so that she is planning on buying one for herself.Although it is not a small carrier, the material is soft enough that it folds up easily so that we can put it in the diaper bag when needed.  Stiffer ones have been difficult to do that with since they would not fold up as easily.",5
4918,"I used the original Ergo with my daughter from birth (with the infant insert) to present (20 months) and have been very happy with it.This new Ergo is even better!Here's why:Stiffer, wider belt with initial velcro attachment (plus adustable strap for security/tightening) really moves the weight from your back to your legs. The first time I put this one one, I could feel my baby's weight completely shift to my legs. With the old Ergo, I'd still get a bit of a strain on my back with a long carry once my baby reached about 20 pounds. With this version, it's all on my legs. Not only is it easier on my back, but I can feel my legs getting a workout as well.Much more flattering. I know this is superficial, but the flat, wide belt doesn't roll or bunch, and doesn't push out your soft, squishy post-pregnancy tummy. Though I've lost my baby weight, I still have the squishy belly, and I hate it. The old ergo, when tightened properly, made my squishy tummy kind of squeeze out over the top, looking dreadful in knits. This one doesn't do that. Not sure if it's because the belt is wider or stiffer, but I'm happy not to look fat and sloppy when I'm wearing the kid.Front-facing position with hip support. I would have appreciated this more with the smaller baby, as having a big baby on front isn't always practical (these days, I mostly wear her when I need to TCB and can't have a toddler underfoot, so having her on my back and out of the way makes more sense), but she really likes the new perspective. I think it would be great for a 9-month to 1-year baby, when they're very curious and confident, but still light and small enough for a front carry not to be burdensome.The one thing I don't like about the new version is the black nap hood. I'm not comfortable putting a black cloth over the baby's head on a sunny day, even when it's cool and breezy. The older version had a light colored hood, which made much more sense. Due to the other improvements, I can't knock of a full star for that alone, because it's a really wonderful carrier, but it's really annoying. I'm hoping since this is an early version of the new design, that they'll fix that.",5
4919,"The ERGObaby 360 is a great carrier. It is light weight and does not cause me back pain or discomfort. I have used the ERGObaby 360 facing inwards and facing front outwards with my 5 month old son who weighs 19 pounds. I have yet to be able to try it with him on my hip or back since he needs to be 6 months old. I received this after he was heavier than 12 lbs, so he was past needing the infant insert. The infant insert needs to be purchased separately.The ERGObaby 360 carrier, has a narrower shape so I am able to fold it up to fit in my diaper bag. The ERGObaby has a Velcro strap that goes around your waist with an additional buckle for safety. This allows people of different sizes to use the carrier comfortably. I have used it, my wife has used it, and even my 5 ft tall mother has used it. My mother said it was more comfortable to use the ERGObaby than carrying my son in her arms because of his size. This carrier does not cause me back pain. It took me some time and repeated use to familiarize myself with the different setting and to feel at ease putting my son securely in this carrier.Some people have had trouble with the instruction manual.  The ERGObaby website has videos that link to YouTube on how to use the carrier. I found these videos to be very helpful. I had previously never used an ERGObaby carrier and the videos helped me to understand the button positioning for inward facing vs outward facing. The hip wearing video was especially useful. Since the straps need be connected in a specific way to make the carrier safe to use on your hip. What the instruction manual didn't mention was the sleeping hood.  The extendable back panel (the fabric in front that folds up for neck support when facing inwards) has a zipper compartment. When you unzip it, unrolls a thin piece of fabric with snaps on the side. When your child is facing inwards you can put this over their head to protect them from the sun or for privacy when they are sleeping or breastfeeding. The snaps attach to the snaps on your shoulder straps. It is a great feature that we have used many times.I also have a Babybjorn One carrier. The ERGObaby requires an infant insert that is sold separately in order to use it with a baby under four months. The Babybjorn One carrier has a zipper that allowed us to use it when our son was an infant. It was nice that the Babybjorn goes from infant to 33lbs without any additional accessories. I really like both carriers and use them both frequently.  For both carriers, you need to hold the carrier with one arm and place the baby in with the other arm.  When inserting the baby into the carrier, I feel the Babybjorn is more secure with the extra buckles. But once the baby is properly in, both carriers feel secure. I highly recommend both.If you are looking at getting an ERGObaby carrier, get the 360 carrier. I like that the ERGObaby has the bucket shape for the baby's hips and spine. Being able to carrier your baby in so many different positions makes it worth the money. It is comfortable and easy to use. The sleeping hood shields my son when sleeping from prying eyes and the sun. It is lightweight and when used properly securely holds my son.  I highly recommend it.",4
4920,"I seriously love everything about this ERGObaby carrier.  I scouted out all the &#34;real&#34; features on their site and put them below.  I love everything about the carrier, especially the versatility factor.  I've had one baby carrier that was a simple front and back facing one, but not quite as sturdy.  It appeared to be part wrap and carrier.  It worked great and was used for a long time, but this one is so much better.The high-quality material is very sturdy, very well sewn and because it's 100% cotton, can be tossed in the washer.  If you're planning on using this with an infant you can add theERGObaby Bundle of Joy Carrier and Infant Insert.  Once a baby hits four months you won't need it.  That's the only drawback I can find, but because it can be used with an older baby, adding one that might not be used would make it cost prohibitive.I do like the photographic visuals in the booklet that show proper step-by-step usage, options, and ways to remove the baby.  The directions also talk about the different ages and ways to carry.  After a while it will be intuitive.  I've put a link to video instructionals in my comments.  Awesome carrier that's pricey, but well worth the money.  The different carrying ways include:1)  Front Carry - Front Inward2)  Front Carry - Front Outward3)  Hip Carry4)  Back CarryFEATURES:&#9658;  STRUCTURED BUCKET SEAT - Keeps baby ergonomically seated in all 4 positions, with knees even to or above hips, with baby's spine in curved &#34;C&#34; position. Button adjustments let parents adapt the seat width to the baby's size & position.&#9658;  EXTRA WIDE VELCRO WAISTBAND - Exceptionally comfortable waistband can be worn high or low on the waist depending on preference and provides extra support for the low back.&#9658;  EXTENDABLE BACK PANEL - Can be rolled down for front-outward, or upwards for the inward facing positions to provide extra head, neck and back support for baby.&#9658;  PADDED SHOULDER STRAPS - Helps evenly distribute baby's weight in combination with the wide waistband to maximize parent comfort.&#9658;  SLEEPING HOOD - Provides support for baby's head while sleeping, protection from sun and added privacy while nursing.

4921,"Slimmer style ergo, my original ergo has been put through the wringer and it still is in perfect shape.  I was so excited to get this new style.  More like a baby bjorn with hopefully better hip placement for baby.  I hate those crotch danglers. So far this one does great!  My only complaint so far is that the hip carry, is too complicated.  I still can't quite figure out how to place the straps to make the hip carry happen.  It comes with a picture manual, but I still couldn't figure the hip carry out. Such a bummer because that was one of the features that I was most looking forward to.  All in all, I love our ergos.  This will definitely replace our older style!",4
4922,"When we had our first kid we could choose between a Boba carrier and an ERGObaby, which at the time were quite similiar, being soft structured carriers.This new ERGObaby carrier is even better, with hip support, more structure in the right places, and overall just improved look and design.  I believe the other thing is the child can be facing out at a much younger age, which is great for some kids who throw a fit if they can't see what is going on.Basically it's better than the original.",5
4923,"Up to getting this carrier, I was a very happy user of a wrap.  My husband had a carrier such as this for him, but I found the wraps much comfier while still offering plenty of support.Well, I was able to use this, quite comfortable, to hike with my daughter through a cave for over an hour.The support is exceptional and the weight is distributed nicely across my shoulders and torso.  The materials is both soft and strong.  Nicest of all, this is fairly idiot-proof when it comes to getting the baby through the spectrum of positions.",5
4924,"and unlike several other baby carriers (such as the Baby Bjorn), this one has four different options for carrying your child, including the common forward and backward options that most chest carriers have. Unlike many others, this one has options for carrying your child on your hip or on your back. This can be a refreshing change, particularly for smaller framed parents who develop muscle pains from carrying growing children in the same position over and over.One of the biggest problems that I had with this carrier is that it is useless for newborns. Although you can purchase an infant insert for this, which I have obtained, it doesn't help at all.Also, I found the instruction manual to be a disaster. It was impossible to follow, and we eventually gave up. We had a friend who's used one teach us how, and then we could review it. Super confusing instructions and worthless for little little ones, this loses a star.",4
4925,"The 360 has everything you could want in a soft form carrier. I love the versatility of the carrier! One of the greatest and newest features to the Ergo line is the outward facing option. Interestingly this carrier spreads their legs apart and distributes the weight evenly throughout their thighs and bottom and avoids the controversial &#34;crotch dangling&#34; that you might hear about with some other carriers. The 360 is absolutely comfortable for babies. In every position my daughter was comfortable and content. I even put my 3.5 year old son in this carrier on my back and he was comfortable, so the longevity of this product is fantastic. The only drawback to me is the velcro. I like to be able to take this off when the baby falls asleep, but the velrco is so loud it wakes her up so I have to wear it until she wakes up.I do not think there is a better long term investment baby carrier on the market. If you are buying this for your newborn, be sure to get the infant insert, that works with all the ergo carriers.",5
4926,"We have a baby bjorn and a regular ERGObaby (facing inward) but this ERGObaby 360 is great because you can use it in 4 different positions. It is more money but is much more versatile. The instructions were simple to understand with the pictures except the hip one. While not hard, the hip one definitely seemed a little more confusing. In terms of comfort our 8 month old definitely looks more comfortable in this carrier than the baby bjorn. The only negative we could see is that in the back carrying position if you have long hair, your baby will be constantly pulling on your hair! Overall, a great carrier though!",5
4927,"Of the three carriers we've tried with our little one, this is by far the favorite. It's soft, padded, supportive, and well designed and built. It's also the most pricey carrier I've tried, but I certainly appreciate the thought that went into designing this, and making it as ergonomic as possible for both the parent (I almost typed mom, but I'm the dad, and use it just as much as she does) and the child.The variety of carrying positions are nice. I haven't used the original ergobaby carrier for comparison, but this one certainly offers more options than either of the other two carriers we've tried, and is even suitable for extended trips and hikes.It's a keeper.",5
4928,"This is the second Ergobaby carrier that I've tried and it's the one I like the best.  The fabric for the carrier is very nice and soft which is perfect for baby's sensitive skin.  The straps on this carrier are very nicely padded which is good if you will be wearing the baby for more than a few minutes.  I like the versatility of this carrier and the different ways you can use it to carry the baby, but I felt the picture instruction booklet was a bit difficult to follow.  In particular, the instructions for using this carrier to hold the baby on your hip are rather complicated.  So with regards to ease of use, I'd say this carrier isn't the easiest one to use, but maybe I'm just spoiled by the super easy to use Bjorn carriers which I've used for my last three babies.I do feel this carrier is best suited for babies in the 4+ month range if you intend to use this during the summer months.  With a younger baby you will have to use the newborn insert which is way too bulky and warm to use when it is hot out.",4
4929,"I have many baby carriers. I use them for my 11 month old (21lbs.) and my 2 year old (35lbs.). I love the rugged fabric of this carrier. It is a little on the short side, so it does not work as well for my 2 year old as my Beco Soleil.This carrier is much wider than the Beco Gemini, so if you're choosing between those two, this would be the better option. The way the seat folds, it creates a little shelf for the baby to sit on. Plenty of butt room, even for cloth diapered booty. The hood is permanently sewn into the zipper pouch and is very light weight. You can wear baby facing forward, like the Beco Gemini. But this carrier puts the baby's legs in a much better position for forward facing. It really helps bend their hips. Now, on a toddler, it doesn't work so well forward facing.I would have given this 5 stars, but there are 2 things I don't like about this carrier. The waistband is wide and velcros around you, which is really comfortable, but the snap strap sometimes gets wonky around the waist and is very difficult to tighten while wearing it. I also dislike the buttons. They take too long to unbutton. I woke the baby up several times trying to unbutton the hood area.Overall, a good, solid carrier. Very padded. Very comfortable for adult and baby.",4
4930,"We had a competitors baby carrier. I hadn't used it a lot because it wasn't the most comfortable and it limited forward arm movement.  We were planning a hiking trip and wasn't looking forward to it.  Once we got the ERGObaby I put it on for a test run.  It still holds the baby a bit away from your body but the weight is centered way different.  It settles on your hips and is an excellent improvement over our old carrier with I no longer believe can compete with the ERGObaby at all.I recommend it to anyone as a more comfortable way to carry.",5
4931,"My daughter loves being able to face forward in this carrier.  She seems to feel like she is more a part of what our older children are doing by being able to see what is going on.  I am thrilled to be able use this with my third baby.  We have several acres of land so it is so nice to just strap this on and take a walk.  Even my husband does not mind using this carrier.",5
4932,"I've tried several baby carriers for my 2 kids from baby ktan, becco gemini, bjorn and slings. They all have pluses and minuses and I have them for different purposes (easy storage, easy on and off etc).This one is so comfortable that I can take the bulkiness when I travel and on the go. Baby loves it, I like the 4 position option and I don't experience any discomfort, while wearing it, even for prolonged time.I thought it will be just another carrier but definitely it's worth investment if you carry baby a lot. Very ergonomic, good for moms and babies.",5
4933,"The Best Ever!Can't say enough positive things about this carrier! With so many similar items on the market from which to choose, it's easy to get discouraged and confused when it comes to choosing correctly. We got lucky with this one-- it's a classic, so simple in its design and yet perfectly innovative in its ergonomics.I got this along with the Ergobaby Infant Insert to use with my new grandson. What can I say-- it's impeccably constructed, good looking, easy to put on and take off, and comfortable enough for both of us grandparents (ages 59 and 63) to wear comfortably for hours.Look no further!",5
4934,"The ERGObaby carrier is wonderful! One of my favorite things to use with our little girl. She absolutely loves to sleep in it and I love that I can have her close to me and still have my hands free. It fits her just right and can easily adjust to fit her as she grows.Although you can wear this four different ways, we tend to only use it with her resting on our chest or facing out from our chest because she is so small still, but I can see us using this as she grows in the other positions (back and hip) too. She sleeps in it very comfortably as she is naturally being supported because of the way the carrier is made to hold her. The carrier is very sturdy. The straps easily adjust, but stay where they need to.My husband and I each have our own so that we don&#8217;t have to adjust straps, however, adjusting is very easy.  My husband is 6'1 and broad, and the waist strap still fits him with some room to spare, so it fits a lot of sizes.  It is very easy to get baby in and out of the carrier too. The straps are very comfortable to wear and it is only about a pound so it is not heavy to carry. The carrier is also very easy to clean with a damp cloth.I am very happy with this product and can&#8217;t wait to continue to use it as our little one gets bigger.",4
4935,"Having twins - I can call myself an expert at carrying babies around.The best and the safest way to carry them around is still with a stroller & car seat - when would you really use this baby carrier ?  I use baby carriers more as a soothing/touching way of carrying them, when I go to the mall, want to walk around while doing household work ..  The warmth of carrying a baby in a carrying is comforting both for the parent as well as the baby.I have 3 baby carries and the ERGO baby along with my Bjorn carrier are the top picks - do not even think of anything else.  What I really like about this  (ERGO baby) is that it can easily fit my 26 lb baby boys who are 1.5 years old.  It says it can fit about 33 lbs, but do not try unless you have a physique which can support that kind of weight and able to walk around without losing weight.The biggest strain is on your back since the weight of the baby pulls you forward and strains your lower back.  The ERGO baby comes with a nice and well fitting back support - do make sure to wear it right.Overall - I would highly recommend this baby carrier.",5
4936,"The mattress feels great to me and my wife. Like a good adult foam mattress. Firm but giving enough in the right way. Our daughter took to it right away and liked it from the get go.When deciding on expense, one thing to keep in mind is that toddler beds, at least ours, uses a crib sized mattress. So we are getting extra use out of it. A good night's sleep benefits everyone in the family. So for that, highly recommended.",5
4937,"I have a standard crib from IKEA and this mattress fits it, just so you know if you also have an IKEA crib. It's more firm by a lot than my soft mattress from IKEA. My daughter slept on it just like normal. No complaints. If you're looking for a mattress that will last for years it's probably worth the cost, you can tell it would last much longer than the cushion only mattresses.",5
4938,"This mattress costs anywhere from $60 - $120 more than an inexpensive crib mattress.Is it worth the cost? Probably.Here are the pros:- While inexpensive ones feel like they just have cheap foam inside, this one actually feels like something an adult would want to sleep in. Pushing down on this versus our $80 dollar one, you can tell the difference.- No chemical smells or others. New mattresses even children ones are created with different chemicals, this one is a fairly natural composition, it does not carry the chemical smell that takes a few months to wear off.Additional notes:- Yes, it's pee-proof/vomit-proof/milk-proof. (the cover obviously). I put it here because virtually every single baby mattress comes with a water proof cover. It's an expected and absolutely necessary feature.- Crib size and toddler bed size are the same. So yes, this mattress works for their toddlers years too.- Some reviews said this mattress was heavy. I thought it was really light myself. Checked the item, and it's 13 pounds shipped, so maybe 10-12 pounds itself. Anyway, it's really light and easy to move around. Your 8 month old is heavier than the mattress!Overall, this mattress deserves 4.5 rating. It's good quality, non chemical smell, make it one of the better crib/toddler mattresses. If it were closer tot he $150 price range, I'd given it 5 stars without hesitation.",4
4939,"After using a hand me down crib mattress, my daughter was happy to upgrade for this one.  Fact is mattresses don't last forever so it's a good idea to update for each child.My daughter likes the feel of this mattress and I like the waterproof surface.  I still use a mattress pad just to be on the safe side so I can wash that.  It's a good feeling though that she's getting the proper type of support to sleep on.It fits the crib and can be flipped to change sheets pretty easily.  At his potty training point, I'm getting lots of practice on changing sheets so sheets go on and off almost daily.If you're looking for a good mattress, this seems to fit the bill.  The only thing I noticed as a negative was a little extra material around the stitching that my daughter pulled back a bit when I was changing the sheets.  When covered with a sheet though, it's not an issue but I do hope it doesn't make the stitching unravel over time.",5
4940,"There is a book called &#34;Baby Bargains&#34; that every year releases a new version highlighting the best picks for parents from everything from bottles to cribs. When I was setting up my nursery, I heavily relied on this book to steer me through the ridiculous maze that is Babies R' Us and the insane amount of choices related to babies. All which claim, by the by, to be the best.This crib mattress was highly recommended as the best out there, and although the price point is a bit higher than others - it is a tiny price to pay for the security of knowing that your child is sleeping on a natural (no fumes!) mattress.Additionally, it is very light. Changing baby sheets is a pain, having a light mattress is important. This mattress will last a couple more years with my toddler while she transitions to a toddler bed from her crib, and I could not be more happy. Do yourself a favor and spend the money - I remember thinking at the time how silly it was that I was spending more money on the mattress then I did the crib (Graco Lauren) but honestly - the mattress matters, buy a good one.",5
4941,"Our baby sleeps well on it, and it seems to cause less sweat during sleep. I cannot talk about waterproof capability, since our baby is too young, and still has nighttime diapers (which don't leak much). Yet so far, it's much more preferable than our older one.Even though this is a more expensive mattress (you might be able to find queen size ones at discount stores for this price), there is a visible difference in quality. Also having no chemical smells, and having health certifications, will probably make you sleep better in addition to your child.",5
4942,"This is a really high quality, top-notch mattress.  I was quite impressed with it when I received it.  A huge plus is that there was no smell and does not contain any toxic chemicals in it.  It feels so soft and plush, not cheap like other mattresses.  One side is firmer for infants and the other side is cushier for toddlers.  It's really nice to have this option for your child.  It's also water resistant, lightweight and easy to clean.  It fits well in our standard sized crib.  The only con is the price, but it really is a quality item and I would choose this over the cheaper products.  It will also last for years, so it's worth it.  Definitely recommend.",5
4943,"Plug it in, start watching the cameras - it's that simple.I was impressed when I felt the heavy outdoor camera, it's made out of solid metal instead of cheap plastic.The wireless range is about the same as an 802.11g WiFi connection.  I get up to 40-60 feet through walls indoors.  It doesn't have the super long range of my Philips AVENT DECT baby audio monitor.The video quality is average (not nearly as good as pro security cameras) but you can see at night because it has infrared LEDs built into the cameras.The temp sensor is not very accurate (mismatch by 3 degrees), but it's close enough to know if your baby is overheating.There is a row of lights at the top that indicate the audio level with a gradient of green, orange, red, which is nice because you can tell that the baby is crying even if you have loud noises near the monitor such as when vacuuming.The controls are super easy to use, and the pan/tilt is fast and responsive, there is minimal latency after pushing the buttons.The outdoor camera is also useful so you know who's at the front door while you're cooking.  I installed mine to watch the pool since I have an electrical outlet near the roof eave in that area.This is a nice baby monitor for the busy person who doesn't have much time to mess around with configuration.  I didn't even have to read the manual since I could tell what the buttons do just by their symbols.I wish it had longer range because this can only reach about halfway across our house.",4
4944,"This chair is easy to hook to the table-- ours has a 3- or 4-inch lip on it, but it hooks on fine. I like that it has a much smaller footprint than a high chair, and lets our baby sit at the table with the rest of the family. The cover is fairly easy to take off to toss in the washing machine.",5
4945,"Feels really safe, love the color, and baby loves it. The trouble is baby LOVES it and likes to suck and chew on every area of the chair. She's also only 6 months old and experimenting with food is happening and messes are an everyday thing. I wish the chair came with a slip cover - or was easier to disassemble for easier deep cleaning. A simple wipe down hasn't worked for us.",4
4946,"This chair is beautifully styled.  That being said it didn't fit on three different tables we tried.  If the table has a standard 4 inch lip underneath it is almost impossible to get the chair to attach and even when you do it takes away from the whole &#34;fast&#34; aspect. Even though we did not really get to use it because of the fit issue I still love it and am considering a new table!",3
4947,"This chair is great.  Easy to assemble and disassemble.  Nice little pocket in the back for storage.  Easy to wipe down.  It didn't fit our dinner table so we just it at the kitchen bar area and she watches us cook.",5
4948,"Helps to keep food from getting stuck under the arms of the Inglesina Fast Table Chair. Easy to snap on and off, and rinse off or put in the dishwasher.",5
4949,"I have no idea why, but this tray that is supposed to fit all Inglesina Fast Chairs did not work with ours. It did not lie flat against the table but tipped up at the front (sloped towards the chair). I thought maybe the plastic was stiff and needed to &#34;relax&#34; a little, but it never did. I tried every which way to make it work and even communicated with the manufacturer, but no luck. Returned it.One thing I will note (assuming it had worked for us) is that the tray doesn't cover the gap between baby and table. It seems to be more about protecting your table than the floor under it. Our baby is small, so there is a fairly large gap between her and the table and she drops things through all the time.",2
4950,"My husband found this through another website - it was hard to hunt down on Amazon for whatever strange reason. We absolutely love our Inglesina chair - we only use it and nothing else at home. The area around the chair and arms gets so disgusting (baby-led weaning), that I was nearly about to break down and get one from Ikea that I could hose down in the shower. But the tray - hooray! It doesn't keep food from falling between the baby and the edge of the table, but he actually has a lip that helps him scoop up food and it keeps the arms and table much cleaner between feedings (and the inevitable full-breakdowns and washes). It does fit awkwardly like another reviewer stated, but not enough to hate it or think it is worthless. It tilts up towards baby slightly, but works perfectly fine.",4
4951,"Love the color. The perfect seat for my child to grow with. The harness is easy to adjust for a perfect fit and its also easy to clean with a damp cloth.",5
4952,"I saw these at costco and decided to get one. They were out of them at the store so we looked online. These are cheaper on Amazon since we got free shipping, so we just got it from here.I hated our previous graco car seat for smaller babies, such a pain to deal with and really uncomfortable for my baby. This one has lots of padding, removable head and bottom padding too. We specifically got this color since it's darker and will hold up better to see-able stains.It was easy to install, the same size as our other car seat, and baby likes it fine. We did have some problems with one of the straps not tightening the same as the other one, so one would be super tight and the other loose. It was our fault as it was a little tangled underneath. Fixed that and now it tightens just fine.Haven't had any problems with heat due to fabric, baby is comfortable and we trust the car seat for it's safety.",5
4953,"Originally written February 13, 2014, but for some reason original product page seems to have been removed. Original review is still up on my public profile.&#34;I bought this seat so my daughter could stay rear-facing for longer, plus I loved the design of the Nicole. It rear faces up to 40lbs and 40in, and forward faces up to 65lbs and 54in. My 3 1/2 year old son is just about to grow out of his convertible, an Evenflo Tribute V, and the Tribute forward faces for as long as the Sureride rear faces. Think about that for a second. With higher weight and height limits for both rear and forward facing, of course it's going to be bigger. It has to accommodate bigger children after all. I don't know why I wasn't expecting it to be monstrously huge, though. With those numbers, if you're going to get it for a newborn, infant, or young toddler, expect the seat to expire before they grow out of it while forward facing.I have yet to actually install it in my car, a '07 Jeep Liberty. I have memo---nightmares from almost 3 years ago from just trying to get the tribute to fit rear facing. It's definitely better suited for a mini van. I will update this review periodically.*EDIT*The car seat didn't actually take up as much room in my car as I was afraid it was going to. The front seat can't be back all the way like my husband likes it, but it does leave a comfortable amount of room. I'm not exactly a short woman, either. It is rather difficult to install, but no more than most convertible car seats in the rear facing position. I'm planning on getting it checked out by a tech just in case. If you have problems installing you car seat(s), I suggest you visit your local inspection site as well. I've had no problems with the harness or buckles, and my daughter has had no problem falling asleep in it.&#34;June 5, 2014, I would like to add a few things. The car seat is huge, no doubt about it, but don't be afraid. You do not have to have a huge vehicle in order for the car seat to fit. It fit in my old vehicle, a 2007 Jeep Liberty. When I went searching for a more fuel efficient car, fitting my car seats was a deal breaker. Surprisingly, it also fit (while rear-facing) a 2012 Honda Fit with my 5'11 husband able to comfortably sit in front of it. If you are not familiar, a Honda Fit is a subcompact car, much much smaller than an SUV. Unfortunately we were recently involved in a bad automobile accident that totalled the new car. I do not recommend subcompact cars now knowing they don't tend to fair well in accidents due to their small size, but I do recommend this seat as well as my son's booster (Evenflo Maestro). They held up very well, and our insurance will be replacing with the same models. Also, the date this was manufactured, I did not receive a model with a recalled buckle, explaining why I never had a problem with the buckle sticking. If you have purchased this seat, make sure to check the Evenflo website to make certain you do not have a recalled buckle.",4
4954,"Overall, I like this Fisher-Price swing, but there are a few features that I am not too thrilled with and could be improved.Pros:This swing, as well as swings in general, are a godsend to parents who are trying to calm and sooth their little ones.The seat looks and feels very comfortable.The unisex design is suitable for both boys and girls, so you can use the same swing with children of different genders.The little mirror above the swing is very intriguing to the little ones.The hanging characters move around, which is another useful distraction.The swing features sixteen tunes and sound, and gives the little one (as well as his or her parents) a much needed variety.Cons:Not easy to assemble.The construction seems fairly flimsy. It looks like it could be easily knocked over or damaged if you accidentally bump into it.I've had some problems with the swinging motor failing over time in my other swing, but so far I have not had any trouble with this one. If anything changes in that regard I'll update this review.",4
4955,"I have the previous version of this swing and really love the upgrades on this newer model.Some updates:The swing sits a bit higher off the floor, about 6 inches higher.There are two additional music options, a daytime/playtime music option and a nighttime/sleeptime music option in addition to the nature sounds.Smart Swing Technology- Basically the motor seems much stronger. It gets the swing going without you having to push it to get it started. It also is able to swing a 14lb baby fast, the older model had trouble maintaining speed as the baby grew. The slow setting is still slow enough for those that like a gentle swing.Some great feature that remain the same:The cover is washable. It is easy to remove and looks brand new every time you wash it.The swing folds up easily for storage, one click and it is small enough to slide into a closet.It plugs in! This really saves on batteries. You still have the option to use battery power if need be though.Overall I believe this is the best swing on the market. I have always been loyal to the Cradle N Swing and this newer model is a solid investment for anyone with a new baby.",5
4956,"Of all the Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swings, the Snugabunny pattern is my favorite.  Its non-gender colors assure this swing can be recycled from one baby to another.  I love the soft tan/light green colors with leaf design netting--nothing outlandish yet it's still childishly delightful.We've not had any problems using this swing and baby enjoys being in it.  Assembly is easy (20 minutes) and the swing is sturdy and stable.  We like Cradle 'n Swing models because they offer some features not found on other swings--plush materials, an adjustable position (recline or  slightly upright), mirrored globe, uses batteries or plug-in option, customized swinging motions and washable seat pad.  The motor has been quiet so far when in motion.  The music can quickly become annoying, but that is easily remedied by turning it off or switching to less obtrusive nature sounds.  This swing does fold up, but it still takes up quite a bit of space.  Recommended weight limit is 25 lbs.Of all the nursery items out there, we've found two indispensable infant sleeping aids.  This Fisher-Price swing andFisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper,  Rainforest Friends. Like the swing, it also comes in a variety of colors/patterns.  It is is so handy for travel or keeping baby close to mom at night.  Both the swing and sleeper have been godsends for us.",5
4957,"Love this swing! It has to be the cutest design ever, and it works amazingly well. We had initially out our first swing up a few months ago because my daughter was getting heavier and it just wouldn't swing well. This design has a feature called smart swing and it didn't even hesitate to swing my 20 lb 9 month old.  I also love the mirrored globe in the middle of the mobile. My baby loves it! I also love the upright and recline positions and the 3 directions it can swing.  All around, I love this swing?",5
4958,"I can't believe all the negative reviews for this product! My little one loves this swing and it has prob not saved my sanity!! She has acid reflux and colic and this is a lifesaver! It's inclined enough for her acid reflux which is great. I do feel like the mobile doesn't really get her attention but she's usually asleep within minutes of swinging anyways. I love this and would recommend it to any mom!! We haven't had any issues and it's been use everyday for almost 2 months!",5
4959,"I was once skeptical about the value of a bouncer as a piece of necessary nursery equipment.  After my grandson arrived, I quickly changed my mind about bouncers. This is definitely an essential piece of equipment for any little one - and an even more essential piece of equipment for the adults caring for the baby.  The &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is even better than previous iterations of the bouncer and one that my new granddaughter loves &#8211; as do the adults in the family.Like all Fisher-Price products, the &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is an excellent quality item. The plastic edges are smooth; they should not injure your infant.  The colorful cloth seating area is nicely finished and the fabric is not cheap or scratchy.  The aqua shades are bright, but not garish.  If necessary and it will be, the cover removes easily for washing.The inclined seat is very useful if your little one suffers from reflux since keeping the baby upright, after feeding, for the 15 - 30 minutes your doctor may recommend can be tiring if the baby is large or it is o-dark-thirty at night.  Further, the incline is also nice because once your baby is a bit older and staying awake more, you can move the seat between rooms as you go about your daily life. This allows the baby to observe different environments and allows you to explain your activities so that the baby's language learning can advance.We found the vibrating feature helpful when the baby was fussy or when she was having difficulty going to sleep. It was soothing and helped calm her down.  When she was awake, the ability to &#8220;bounce&#8221; provided exercise and entertainment; it also helped strengthen muscles that were not yet ready for crawling.The two-sided, arched toy that can be attached is very nice feature. Unless you turn on the music or motion, the actions/tunes do not &#34;go&#34; continually, but require that the baby do something to activate the music, motion, or toys. This is particularly nice if you are an individual who dislikes the continuous, automated music of some infant toys.  On one side of the arch, the high contrast design and the mirror are excellent for the youngest users.  Once your little one is a bit older, the second side&#8217;s colorful parts are eye-catching and stimulate your baby's visual sense; they are bright, but not gaudy.Although rated for up to 25 lbs., the &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is useful up to about 20 pounds.  At that point, the baby's weight is sufficient to prevent the upright position from being particularly useful.  You may find, as I did, the &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is essential for any parent or caregiver - it fills a number of useful functions, is well made, and little ones love it.",5
4960,"It can easily switch from use on the stroller to being carried.  makes for a nice small size organizer to use when grocery shopping.  I love how versatile it is.",5
4961,"This is my first encounter with a Dot&Dot; stroller product and it's a really positive one.  No, you won't be able to put as much in it as a diaper bag or backpack, but it does keep all of those little essentials close at hand.  You can put everything in this organizer from a bottle to a diaper.What anyone wants to carry is a matter of preference or need, but this little organizer has options some I've tried don't.  For example, you can hang the organizer by the sewn-in clips / straps to the back of a seat in your car.  You can use the hooks to hang the organizer anywhere you want.  These attach to the organizer with 1"" Velcro straps.  I like the weight option of 11 pounds, but doubt I'd ever put that much in the bag.The attention to detail is quite good and of course with the the 100% warranty, you know that Dot&Dot; stands behind their products. It's made of a sturdy combination of materials I often do see on backpacks. I do like the magnetic clasp on the larger center pocket.  It immediately snaps shut and would especially be a great storage space for a diaper.A bottle or can of soda fits well in the organizer, but at first I was worried about a taller metal water bottle.  One other organizer I had was a bit iffy in that department.  No problem because the holders are a full 6"" deep.  They are about 3-1/2"" wide and the fit was perfect, even for the wide Munchkin bottles I have.The reinforcement is really good.  There's what I'm assuming is some sort of plastic reinforcement on the bottom and thick wire (like a hanger) around the top.  The organized keeps its shape when in use, but can fold flat if you want to store it.  It's a high quality, one-size-fits-every-stroller and the back of any car seat.Sample provided for review.",5
4962,"I really like the idea of this product. I love something you can take from one stroller to the next with you that holds drinks, snacks, personal belongings and it is easy to take off/on as well as use.I first used this item while taking a walk in the park with my daughter. It was perfect for this ocasion. I was able to use the carrier to hold my cell phone and car keys for quick access. My daughter's snack case also fit easy in this spot but I could not fit her sippy cup (she has handles on the sides, so bigger width) or a water bottle for me because it was too heavy. Instead I used it more for pockets and storage which I could always use!After using this for almost a week I found myself using the hooks that come with this more than anything else. I have used the hooks so many times for many different reasons. I would buy this just for the hooks.I think the idea of this product is wonderful, it doesn't work for everything I would have liked it to but this gave me great extra storage while using my stroller and I really needed it to hold extra things, like a cell phone and camera without having to dig into my diaper bag.  The hooks are AMAZING!This product was provided by Dot & Dot in return for an honest review.",4
4963,"I have another stroller organizer that velcros onto the handlebar, I far prefer the clips on this one. I like the phone and zipper pouch. The cup holders are too small for my needs. I have a large tervis cup that didn't fit, which didn't surprise me but I tried to put a regular sized plastic bottle and it didn't really fit. My britax b-agile double stroller doesn't have a cup holder and I take my water everywhere so for me the small cup holder is a bit of a deal breaker.Overall the organizer is well constructed and looks like it will hold up nicely. The hooks are very well designed. I like that they rotate and swivel to accommodate any stroller or bag.Disclosure: I was given this product for free in exchange for an honest review.",4
4964,"My last stroller organizer bit the dust in less than 24 hours, it was very poorly made so I had high hopes for the Dot&Dot; stroller organizer. It really fits the bill, and then some! It is the perfect size for my needs, not too bulky. I usually only require a stroller organizer for short walks, so that is what I am basing my review on. The included accessory clips are perfect for connecting a purse or diaper bag for longer excursions, they are very sturdy.Specs:Size: 12.5&#8221; long, 6&#8221; tall and 4&#8221; deepI was able to fit my keys, phone, bib, Camelback .6L water bottle, Thermos Foogo bottle, binky, small toy and small snack container into the organizer - and there was room for many more small accessories. Keep in mind, this is great for small excursions or aerobic walk/run. For longer excursions when you might bring lots of items - the included stroller clips allow for you to attach a larger bag of baby stuff.This organizer fit on my Britax B-Agile and BOB Revolution strollers.What I love:-The packaging was fun - it came in a handy plastic pouch with a zip-top-Well made. The straps are sewn really well into the nylon lining, I don&#8217;t see them coming loose anytime soon.-The magnetic center pouch. Perfectly planned for mommy&#8217;s on the move, this compartment is perfectly placed and the magnetic cover makes it so easy to access for a binky, toy or snack when exercising. Nothing more annoying than grappling to zip or velcro open a pocket while trying to keep my pace, this one is SUPER simple.-It is sleek! I have black strollers and I really like that it just blends in - like it belongs on the stroller.-It keeps its shape and does not sag. I had another similar organizer that sagged and it drove me nuts, it is so difficult to reach for small items when everything is squished together. This organizer has an interior metal frame around the top and a thick lining on the bottom that provides a &#8220;platform&#8221; for contents to stand on.Overall, I highly recommend this organizer and would consider buying it as a gift for other mommy's as well!",5
4965,"I really liked this monitor at first, but the second night of use I decided to unplug and bring the receiver over to my nightstand.  The night before I left it plugged in across the room on my dresser.  With our old Angelcare, the battery always lasted through the night (8 hours or less) but the VTech monitor was off when I woke up.  WTH?  Turned it back on and saw the low battery.  Nice.  Good thing my child is a sound-sleeping toddler who rarely wakes, and not an infant in need of several feedings in the night.  I will go back to my Angelcare.We tried it the next day during nap time, and the battery started to die (after a full charge) in under 3 hours.Original Review:We were using an Angelcare basic sound monitor, nothing special, before getting this.  The Angelcare's audio is still working after 2 years, but the display is no longer functioning.  We switched to this a few nights ago and I like it better.*The sound quality is good.  We use a noise machine in our son's room and the Angelcare always sounded very echo-ey.  With this VTech, the noise machine sounds like it's sitting on our dresser.  I can clearly hear my son if he makes any noise in the room.*The video display is good for this price point, but still mediocre.  The angle is not wide enough and takes some careful positioning.  I have nothing to compare it to, but I would imagine if you spent more on it you'd get better video. You can definitely tell what you're looking at, but it reminds me a bit of looking at an ultrasound picture when the room is dark.  You can make out his head and see him moving.  I don't know what I expected.  In any case, this is not a feature I require, so any video is nice to have.  I'm not sure how useful this would be with an infant.  My son is 2.  It is nice to see if he's in there standing up if he makes a sound, or if maybe he's just dreaming.*Very easy to hook up.  I made no adjustments to it and just turned it on.  It was dead out of the box and needed a charge, but we have not lost reception anywhere in our 1900 sq, foot house.  Our Angelcare had a cradle charger, and I do miss that, but the simple A/C plug works fine, too.*Talk back feature is nice.  Haven't used it yet, but I like having the option.  Especially for when my son jumps to his big boy bed.  Again, not sure if this would be useful for an infant.I have this sitting on a dresser, so I have not tried a wall or ceiling mount, but I would imagine you'd get better visuals if you did that.  As it is, I can see my son through the crib bars, but it's not the best line of sight.Overall, I think this is a great and inexpensive video monitor, and I think it's more than adequate for most people's needs.",2
4966,"Pros:Hotspot technology does not require router connection, 300' range (I've only tested this within the house, with no issues)Password securityCamera can be used without the base; 3 hours of operation on rechargeable batteryGreat night visionNight light, lullaby tunesTake pictures and video to your phone (1280x720 or 848x480 resolution)Two-way talkMotion event recording to optional SD cardMotion, sound, or temperature alerts, all of which work pretty wellCons:3-hour battery life is not much, although not sure when you would use this.

4967,"I am on the fence with this thing. I was surprised the thermometer was not packed with plastic around it. It seemed very exposed and knowing you are putting it in your ears, I did not feel very hygienic. However, I cleaned it off and all seemed well.It states it comes with 2 double AA batteries, not the case with mine. There was an empty spot were the batteries were supposed to be but there were no batteries. I had to put in my own. I don&#8217;t know if that was a quality control issue or not but it states it comes with them, has a spot for them, but they were no included.The instructions are not that easy to understand. Meaning, you follow the steps but yet the thermometer does not respond the way the instructions read. I finally figured out how to get it to work, however, the temperatures are very inconsistent. I tried it on myself and had a higher reading then normal. I then tried another one I have and it read a temperature almost two degrees lower. I then tried it on my daughter; it read the same temperature had. When we tried the other, hers read higher than the one it displayed.Right now I can&#8217;t recommend this item. I am going to try it out more but right now it is a not impressing me at all. The plastic does feel a bit cheap in your hands but the shape of the device is rather nice. I will say it is very easy to hold.If my readings change on it I will update my review. But as of not, I am not that impressed.Sample item provided.",3
4968,"My granddaughter is autistic and finds having her temperature taken difficult. So, when I was offered a complimentary sample of this product to test for a review, I had the perfect subject in mind.She was a bit squirmy, and I was concerned about whether I would be able to get a &#34;good temperature.&#34; Once I figured out how to use the thermometer, it worked perfectly for her.The first issue involved the batteries (Included!). Somehow I didn't get one of them in tight enough and I wasn't able to close the back cover. My husband made sure they were inserted correctly and tightly, and it snapped down.Second, the instructions are confusing. I think they are confusing because they try to tell you too much. So I'm putting them here.To change from C to F setting, push the button once, then hold it down a second time till it changes.To take temperature. Push the button and wait till the F (or C) is flashing. Place probe in ear and push button once. Wait till it beeps and take it out.In checking ears at home, repeated checks came up with the same consistent temperature. My husband and I both measured 98.6 in both ears. :-) My granddaughter, who had been in the pool swimming was actually a bit cooler.Since this can be used at night without disturbing a child (or an adult), I have added this to my first aid kit.It did come in a very nice box with information on the box in addition to the instructions, so I wouldn't hesitate to give this as a baby gift to a new parent.Again, I received a complimentary sample from Gogogu to test for my revew.",5
4969,"This doesn't seem to be as accurate as the rectal baby thermometer my step daughter uses. It was within about .01 degrees however, so that's pretty darn close while avoiding the discomfort of a cold glass pipe up the pooper and MUCH less distressful for the baby. As a first goto, this is great. If there is cause for more concern, one might wanna go for the Howard Stern.When my son was small I had one of these and paid significantly more for it. (Not the same brand) This one seems to be of similar quality but more accurate than I remember, so maybe it is just simply that the cost of tech has gone down while improving? There are still more expensive options...but why? We all know that when the baby is sick, we are going for the easy check first but when real concern arises, nothing beats the back door for confirmation.Sample supplied without obligation.",5
4970,"As any parent will tell you, getting a temperature reading from your young child can be a real pain in the derriere. Most young children are not willing to stand still for the duration needed to get an accurate reading from a standard thermometer. A contactless thermometer seems to be an ideal tool for such situations. This Gogogu thermometer is indeed a godsend, but it's not without its limitations.This thermometer is for the most part easy to use. It takes only a second for it to get a temperature readings, which is really great. The small digital screen displays the reading clearly, although it could be a bit brighter.One major issue that I have with this thermometer is that the readings are not very consistent. I've done several temperature readings in a row, and each one of them ave me a slightly different result. Sometimes results were close to each other, but sometimes they differed by more than a degree. The results also varied with the ear that I used, also sometimes by a whole degree. The good news is that the thermometer is very quick and easy to use, so if you don't mind averaging several repeated measurements, then you will still probably get a good overall reading.Another issue that I have with this thermometer is that the instructions are not all that clearly written. It was hard to understand sometimes if I had to hold and release a button during the setup, or keep holding it. Nonetheless, with a bit of trial and error I managed to get it working.The thermometer fits nicely in your hand. It is not built from the highest quality plastics, but it does get the job done. I would certainly continue using it and do recommend it to other parents - especially considering its affordable price.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****",4
4971,"This appears to be modeled after the more expensive Braun model and works as well for us so far.THE GOOD-No probe covers needed.-Easy to read backlit display.-Simple to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit by just holding the power button for a few seconds.-Accurate. Better than several other ear thermometers I've bought at drugstores.-Quick. Readings in just one second.-Beep is not too loud. One model beeped so loud it woke my daughter every time I tried taking her temperature while she slept, This one is fine.THE BAD-Feels a little cheap. Battery contacts had to be bent into place.-Although it's advertised as including batteries and there's a space for them in the box, batteries were missing.-A storage pouch would have been nice.I love the ease of ear thermometers and this is a good pick. Packaging on my box says Babyly Infrared Thermometer-- not sure if they changed brand names.Received for review.",4
4972,"This baby carrier is SOOO much better than the one I used when my youngest was a baby. It is easier to put on - and adjust - the comfortable padded shoulder straps and waist strap.The carrier has many adjustment points, too, to adjust for the changing size of the baby, which makes for a more secure ridealong.It is sturdy but padded and comfortable for both baby and whoever might be carrying.The clicking latches with a green indicator are a neat idea so that you know baby is securely fastened in.There is a zippered flap on the front of the carrier that can be opened to allow air circulation through a mesh covering. On the other side of the flap is a mesh pouch with a Velcro fastener to store smaller objects in. It isn't big enough for a diaper but could be used for house key, phone, pacifier, cash, credit card.Baby can face either facing whoever is carrying him/her or can face outward facing the world.It also comes with a nifty carrying case that fits the carrier nicely.It is made for babies 8-26 pounds.This is one of the nicer, easier-to-use carriers I've seen and well worth the price.",5
4973,"Wow, compared to what I used for my own child, this is a breeze to put on and attach.  I sat down on the couch and put it on and then put my nephew into it and latched him in.  This says it can be used up to 26 pounds, but I found it tiring to carry a 25 pound baby in it for very long.  When I got this I read it wrong and thought it could be used in front or wear on my back, but it's the baby who faces different positions while you carry him like a kangaroo.The latches are ingenious, just sliding in, then you cinch it to the correct size.  Lots of padding on the shoulders and for the baby's head makes it pretty comfortable.  The support is just right, and there is a way to adjust for height for the baby so he's always in the right position.",5
4974,"The padding on the MLB carrier is awesome. I used to use a Bjorn which cost so much more, but this one is great. It's also adjustable everywhere, so if it doesn't feel quite right, just move a strap or two. Baby can face you or the rest of the world. I'd recommend this product.",5
4975,"Majority of baby products are out there are very much catered to women so it was great to find a great quality baby carrier that's a perfect fit for the dads out there!Don't let the sports logo branding fool you - this is a top notch carrier. The shoulder and waist strap are excellently padded for maximum comfort and support for the parent. The seat is also padded making it equally comfortable for the baby. It's easy to make various adjustments to the straps to ensure the perfect positioning, and also to adjust the carrier as your child grows (can be used for babies 8-26 lbs).",5
4976,"These monitors do not work at all, I even attempted to contact customer support to figure out if there was a resolvable issue but they will not get back to me.

They will be on for a few minutes, then lose connection and have no sound, then back to working again. I would NOT recommend these monitors at all.",1
4977,"Despite the fact that the AAP and NHTSA (plus other lettered child safety advocates) have been recommending for YEARS that children stay rear facing AT LEAST until they turn two, this brand new forward only seat has instructions saying it can be used for 20lb 1-year-olds.  Of course, most state laws are behind on this, but I&#8217;d feel better if I thought a car seat manufacturer was more concerned with what is safe than what is legal.  Climbing off soap box now.As a mother of four kids between the ages of 5 and 11, I&#8217;ve installed and used quite a few car seats and I&#8217;m reasonably happy with this one&#8217;s ease of use.  The only installation issue was that the crotch strap was difficult to adjust.  We needed to move it to the forward position and this is typically an easy step.  The fabric had weird overlaps where you had to feed each section through separately (sorry that&#8217;s difficult to describe) and then the plastic slot was still tight.  I was tempted to fetch a hammer but managed to get it out.  The harness straps slide up and down with the head rest to make rethreading them unnecessary.  This is a plus.  I&#8217;ve always hated seats that needed to be removed from the vehicle to move the shoulder straps up.  The highest headrest position can only be used with the booster and this isn&#8217;t labeled at all so you might need to pull it all the way up and then make sure you slide it down a notch.Getting it into the car (or van) is pretty simple with LATCH.  It works like most other LATCH friendly seats.  The front of the base comes right to the front of our seat so it&#8217;s a bit thick.  The harness adjustment for buckling the child is easy and familiar.  I&#8217;ve seen this system with a pull strap on front before.  Pull the strap to tighten and release the tiny lever to loosen.  There&#8217;s a small pad attached to the crotch strap and the Velcro that holds it on is so small it doesn&#8217;t hold.  It came off the first few times I tried to buckle my child and I gave up on putting it back on.  It&#8217;s a comfort thing and not a safety thing anyway.This seat is bulkier and heavier than most booster only seats.  We&#8217;ll likely keep using it rather than buy a new one but I thought I should mention that.  It&#8217;s something to think about if you&#8217;ll be moving a booster back and forth between vehicles.",4
4978,"We have been using Graco car seats for years and this is just as good, if not better than the others. It looks great and the seat is very soft and cushiony. It is easy to adjust and actually easier than our other model because of the way the straps are connected. I love how this converts into different seats as the child gets older also.It is very easy to install, but we found that some car seats do not work in some cars depending on the back seat. Not the seat's fault but the car design.My only complaint is the new strap buckle system for the straps the connect to the car. It is no longer the seat belt type of strap but a button to push. I though it would be easier to adjust the length of the strap at first, but it is actually harder.Overall great car seat and highly recommend.",4
